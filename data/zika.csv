"The World Health Organization is evaluating the risks of holding this August's Olympic Games in Brazil as regularly scheduled, amid widespread fears of spreading the Zika virus beyond the hot zone in South America.Director-General Margaret Chan said experts will meet shortly to discuss the situation and report their findings.""Given the current level of international concern, I have decided to ask members of the Zika Emergency Committee to examine the risks of holding the Olympic Summer Games as currently scheduled,"" she said in a letter to Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Democrat.Mrs. Shaheen released the letter early Friday.""The Olympic Games draw athletes and spectators from every corner of the globe and it's important that we understand the global health implications,"" the senator said.Zika is a mosquito-borne illness that can cause birth defects in infants born to infected mothers. It's also been linked to Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which can cause paralysis.The virus is mainly spreading in Brazil and other Latin American countries. More than 150 health experts recently called on Olympic officials to postpone or move games, because athletes and other travelers to Rio de Janeiro could get infected and bring the virus home with them.The WHO rejected such calls only days ago, arguing attempts to cancel or move the games would not significantly alter the international spread of Zika.Dr. Chan's letter suggested that WHO's review is ongoing. She has dispatched senior epidemiologists to Brazil four times, most recently in early May, to assess the situation.The Centers for Disease Control has recorded more than 600 travel-related cases of Zika in the 50 states and D.C., a handful of them through sexual transmission, though experts say the virus could puncture the mainland further once mosquito season ramps up.Republican negotiators are trying to reconcile House and Senate measures that offer roughly a third to one half of the $1.9 billion that President Obama requested in February to combat Zika at home and abroad.Democrats and some Florida Republican say Zika is such an emergency that Congress should approve Mr. Obama's full request without paying for it with cuts elsewhere in the massive federal budget.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said he will try to force GOP lawmakers to take another thorny vote against the $1.9 billion package when Congress returns from recess next week. ","washingtontimes","right","16955","zika",393
"WASHINGTON -- Congress managed to beat the Memorial Day vacation traffic by fleeing town on Thursday. But what it failed to do before taking 10 days off was pass a bill that gives health officials the funding they estimate they need to combat the Zika virus.What Congress did instead is offer an object lesson in what's wrong with Congress, treating the need to respond to Zika not as a public health emergency that's already affected more than 1,500 Americans, but as an opportunity to pass other things, usually things the public doesn't want.It began in February when the Obama administration, advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asked Congress to approve $1.9 billion in emergency funding to begin dealing with Zika. The virus is especially dangerous to pregnant women, who, according to a new study, have up to a 13 percent chance of delivering a baby with microcephaly.The idea had been to begin getting ready for the mosquitoes that carry Zika well before the start of summer breeding season, and to dramatically ramp up vaccine research, education and mitigation efforts. Congress decided that the administration already had enough money. The White House had to transfer $589 million from its successful, ongoing Ebola response to get started.And that's when Congress started treating the still-standing funding request (the administration wants to replace that Ebola funding) as an opportunity.The Senate, rather than simply bringing up a bill to answer the request, decided to attach it to a must-pass spending bill. Republicans, when offered the chance to consider a clean Zika bill, said they might do so -- but only if Democrats agreed to Obamacare cuts.The spending bill was a combination of money for military construction, Veterans Affairs, housing and urban development, and transportation programs. Buried in that huge measure were provisions to weaken truck driver fatigue rules, backed by an industry that spends $20 million a year to influence Congress. Several senators offered an amendment to oppose the rollbacks, but they never got to bring it up. Senate leaders instead brought up an amendment for a $1.1 billion Zika bill. In the end, 89 senators voted for the overall package.That left the House, which did bring up a standalone Zika bill, but with only $622 million, or about a third of the request. But it also sensed an opportunity. Leaders there decided to rename a deregulatory pesticide bill as a Zika bill. Backed by agriculture and pesticide industries which spend more than $30 million a year to influence Congress, the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, which would exempt pesticides from the Clean Water Act, had failed to pass the Senate for five years. Rebranded the Zika Vector Control Act, it passed the House Tuesday.But there is no companion pesticide bill in the Senate, which means it would go nowhere unless the House found a way to make the Senate take it up.Wednesday night, around 9:30, Republican leaders found a way. They went to the Rules Committee, which sets the rules for measures that get debated and voted on in the House, and put together their short-funded Zika bill and the pesticide exemption bill with the House's military and veterans funding bill. They then attached all of that to the great big funding bill the Senate passed -- the one that weakens rest rules for truck drivers. It passed, 233-180, on a nearly perfect party-line vote.Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who managed some of the floor debate for the GOP, declared linking it all together ""makes a lot of sense.""Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), chairman of the Rules Committee, said the step showed the House was functioning effectively.""We care about people. We're doing the right thing,"" Sessions said. ""What is the administration doing other than just accusing us of not spending more money?""Democrats didn't see it that way, and all but one voted against the cobbled-together bill, and argued that going slow on Zika prevention could prove extremely costly.According to an estimate cited by CDC head Tom Frieden, the cost of treating microcephaly for one baby is about $10 million. At that rate, it would take just 60 infants born with microcephaly to absorb the entire $600 million cost difference of those two Zika bills. More than 300 pregnant women in the U.S. and its territories have Zika.""Yes, we all want to be fiscally responsible, but ... if all you're worried about is the bottom line ... [the costs of] not adequately funding what is needed to combat this crisis ... will be prohibitive,"" Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said. ""You ain't seen nothing yet. So we can nickel and dime this if we want, but we do so at our own peril.""Of course, Congress is now on vacation, so it will be nearly two weeks before senators and House members even start to sit down to work out the differences between the giant spending measure the Senate passed and the additions to it the House made on its way out the door Thursday.And when they do -- mostly behind closed doors -- what emerges may or may not be the Zika funding that the health officials believe is required. But there will be other things that will have to pass along with it, that on their own would go nowhere or face veto threats, like those watered-down tired trucker rules and other things, such as restrictions on President Barack Obama's ability to close the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. If Obama or anyone else wants to block any of that, they'll have to block the Zika measure, too.   ","huffingtonpost","left","16947","zika",999
"TEL AVIV - Women visiting countries afflicted with the Zika virus should refrain from getting pregnant while there and for four weeks after leaving the country, the Israeli Health Ministry advised Tuesday.The recommendation also stated that people visiting Zika areas should refrain from donating blood for 28 days after their return, Haaretz reported.The Health Ministry assesses that a month is long enough for people to be certain that they haven't contracted the virus, whose incubation period is usually three to 12 days.The virus is suspected of causing microcephaly, a severe condition in which babies are born with underdeveloped brains, though the connection has yet to be clinically proven.Previously it was believed that Zika could only be contracted by a bite from an infected mosquito, though the ministry's new directives seem to indicate that Zika can be contracted through sexual intercourse.""In a few cases, men who contracted the virus infected their partners through intercourse,"" the ministry's statement said. It therefore advised people who visit a country suffering from Zika ""to use a condom while having sexual relations during their stay there, and also for four weeks after leaving the danger zone.""The ministry had previously recommended that pregnant women or women planning to get pregnant postpone trips to affected areas. The recommendations also advised anyone traveling to affected countries to take precautions against mosquito bites.The ministry's statement included a list of countries defined as risk zones, broken down by region as follows: In the Americas: Brazil, Venezuela, Panama, Honduras, Colombia, El Salvador, Surinam, Guatemala, Paraguay, Mexico, Martinique, French Guiana, Puerto Rico, and Haiti. In southeastern Asia: Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand. In the Pacific Ocean: Samoa, Fiji, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, the Cook Islands, eastern Micronesia, and French Polynesia. In Africa: Cape Verde, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda.The World Health Organization declared Zika a global health emergency on Monday. It noted that the virus was found in the brains of five out of 49 babies who died of microcephaly recently. The WHO also said it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine against the virus.","breitbart","right","16834","zika",361
"The Florida Department of Health has confirmed that three pregnant women have Zika after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the Zika outbreak could get worse before it gets better.""We have, however, identified three pregnant women who traveled to countries affected by Zika and likely had Zika virus in those countries and returned without any symptoms,"" stated Florida Surgeon General Dr. John Armstrong.Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency because of the Zika virus earlier this month. So far, doctors have diagnosed 32 Floridians with the virus. Officials consider three cases active infections.Governor Scott has ""requested 250 additional Zika antibody tests from the CDC"" after he learned about the pregnant women. The tests allow people ""to see if they ever had the Zika virus."" The majority of people who contract Zika do not experience any symptoms.""We have made it a priority to stay ahead of the possible spread of this virus in Florida,"" concluded Armstrong.WHO Director-General Margaret Chan traveled to Brazil, the epicenter of the outbreak, to meet with health officials.""Things may get worse before they get better,"" she declared at a press conference in Rio de Janeiro. ""Don't be surprised to see microcephaly reported in other parts of Brazil.""Brazilian authorities have confirmed at least 580 cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect linked to the virus. It occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth, causing small heads. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.Dr. Sandra Mattos found microcephaly data on 100,000 newborns since 2012 in Brazil that indicates that at least 1,600 babies born in the last four years had microcephaly or smaller-than-normal heads. ""We were very, very surprised,"" she said. ""Borderline cases seem to be present all along.""CBC News reports:Mattos told WHO that ""other potential factors need to be considered"" since 80% of the microcephaly babies live in northeast Brazil.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced that doctors had confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly.""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC Director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of claiming Zika caused the microcephaly cases. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.The Czech Republic recorded its first cases of Zika after two people returned from a vacation in the Caribbean. The man and woman do not require hospitalization.""This is not a case of an infection having spread in the Czech Republic. It is a disease brought from the areas where we recommended that people not travel,"" explained Health Minister Svatopluk Nemecek.","breitbart","right","16856","zika",473
"Mosquito season is in full swing in the Gulf states.""Give us the money so we can work with American women and children and families to monitor the effects of Zika, so we can do a better job at killing mosquitoes to protect American women, and so we can develop better tools to diagnose Zika, to control mosquitoes and ultimately, with NIH in the lead, to find a vaccine to protect women,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionZika is a virus spread by the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito, which can cause fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red or pink eyes). The majority of those infected with the Zika virus do not even get sick. But, Zika virus can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus during pregnancy or around the time of birth, which may cause a serious birth defect of the brain called microcephaly .The American Gulf<U+200B> coast is predicted to be ground zero for the virus this summer. Cities such as Houston, New Orleans, Mobile, Biloxi, Tampa and Miami are beginning to experience a rainy season with increasing heat (exacerbated by climate change) creating favorable environments for the Aedes aegypti mosquito to replicate rapidly. President Barack Obama requested $1.9 billion four months ago to research this horrible virus and prevent localized outbreaks. The request is what the CDC said they needed to hopefully nip this virus in the bud before this national emergency explodes out of control. But guess what? The GOP Congress pushed through only $622 million to combat the virus. The Senate? Not much better.News.Lee.Net<U+200B> reports:The 241-184 House vote broke mostly along party lines as Democrats lined up in opposition, heeding a White House veto threat and a warning from a top government health official that the bill wouldn't do enough to respond to the growing threat from Zika.""It's just not enough,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden said of the House measure. ""It doesn't give Americans the protections they deserve, and with every day of delay it gets harder to do this."" He added that he's ""optimistic that at the end of the day they're going to do the right thing on Zika.""Overall, President Barack Obama requested $1.9 billion three months ago for the fight against Zika, which is spread by mosquitoes and sexual contact and can cause severe birth defects. The Senate is moving ahead this week with a $1.1 billion plan and agreed with Obama that the money should be added to the budget deficit rather than be ""offset"" with cuts to other programs.Democrats and the White House have been hammering at Republicans for dragging their feet on Zika, but the political tempest in Washington hasn't been matched by fear among the public, at least according to recent polling. But GOP leaders see a political imperative to act as the summer mosquito season heats up.","dailykos","left","16961","zika",488
"A pair of Major League Baseball games scheduled to be played in Puerto Rico later this month will be relocated to Miami due to growing concerns among players over the Zika virus in the area.The games between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Miami Marlins originally scheduled to be held in San Juan on May 30-31 have been relocated to Marlins Park, MLB and the Players Association said in a joint statement on Friday.MLB and the Players Association did everything possible to address the concerns and keep the games in Puerto Rico, but despite extensive efforts they were unable to develop a workable solution, according to the statement.Players and staff of both clubs received briefings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the risks associated with the Zika virus, and Manfred decided that nobody should be forced to travel to Puerto Rico.Zika, a virus known to cause the birth defect microcephaly, first began spreading in Puerto Rico in December and there are now nearly 700 confirmed cases of Zika on the Caribbean island.","huffingtonpost","left","16927","zika",196
"Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is surely becoming the conscience of the Senate. Too bad Republicans have no desire for one. She blasted them in a floor statement ahead of votes they finally agreed to take on funding Zika research and prevention. Warren called GOP senators out for dragging their feet on even having votes, and for coming up with some completely inadequate proposals for dealing with Zika-namely by taking money from other prevention programs-in the name of their ""anti-spending ideology.""Today, months after president Obama first requested nearly $2 billion to fight the Zika virus in the United States, the Republicans who control the Senate will finally, finally let us vote on options for funding the Zika response. Today the Senate will consider three proposals. The first proposal would completely fund the president's response plan. It offers our best hope to fully protect Americans, and I will vote for that proposal. I plead with every senator to do the same because that's what our nation's experts have said it will cost to limit the sickness, death, and deformity caused by the Zika virus. []I hope it passes the Senate. If it doesn't, it will be because the majority of Senate Republicans vote against it. And if that happens, we will be forced to consider another proposal. The second proposal would give the president half of what is needed to fight the outbreak. [] Cutting the Zika funding requests in half might give Republicans a chance to tell people how tough they are on spending, and that may be how Republican politics works. But, boy, it's sure not how science works. It is not possible to delay a response to a health emergency for month after month without consequences. It is not possible to nickel and dime a response to a health emergency without consequences. []Now the final Republican proposal is even dumber.","dailykos","left","16938","zika",313
"A private clinic in Brazil has recommended pregnant women wear burqas to protect themselves against Zika due to possible connections to the rare birth defect microcephaly.""A private clinic in Recife recommends pregnant women wear gloves, long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks, and a burqa on the head against Zika,"" wrote Ancelmo Gois in O Globo.Authorities consider Recife in Pernambuco state, located 1,433 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, the epicenter of the Zika outbreak. Brazil has recorded over 4,000 cases of microcephaly since 2015. At least 1,300 of those infants live in Pernambuco state.Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.Aedes aegypti mosquitos carry the Zika virus. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations (Chile and Canada are the exceptions). They also carry Dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya. Doctors found the disease in an infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.Neuro-pediatrician Dr. Vanessa Van Der Linden examined three infants in August and discovered calcification on their brain CT scans ""caused by an infectious disease rather than a genetic abnormality, leading Van Der Linden to suspect that there was a new virus at work."" When her mother, another neuro-pediatrician, said seven more children in the waiting room had microcephaly, Van Der Linden contacted the state's health secretary.Pediatrician Angela Rocha believes Osvaldo Cruz University hospital ""has treated more than 300 babies with the condition."" She said the majority come from the poorer areas of the city where many lack running water. This means residents must store clean water, which become mosquito breeding sites.In November, the Recife government ordered the city's 600 health workers to travel ""house to house to eliminate potential breeding grounds and educate the public about the disease the mosquito carries."" Over 200 soldiers accompany the health workers.""Previously, people didn't always want to let us into their homes,"" explained Christine Penaforte, the executive secretary of health monitoring. ""But the army is respected and so residents are more likely to let us in.""A month later, Rocha recommended females delay pregnancy for a year or two.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" she told CNN.Fear of microcephaly and other complications have allegedly pushed women to illegal abortions in Brazil. Doctors indicate women in all social classes are seeking out these abortions ""in despair over the possibility of deformity."" Some even go through with abortions without concrete proof of complications.Brazil outlawed abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. A judge must approve the case.One Brazilian judge announced he will grant Zika-infected women abortions if they can prove their unborn child has microcephaly. He insisted these abortions are ""valid"" if reports prove the child will ""be born dead"" or ""life after birth is impossible."" He will require at least three separate medical records to reach his decision.","breitbart","right","16839","zika",520
"It wasn't long ago that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa raged out of control, reached U.S. cities, and prompted the United Nations Security Council to declare Ebola a threat to global security. It was a frightening period. It was only the second time - HIV was the first in 2000 - that an epidemic had been labeled by the United Nations in such terms. The Ebola crisis is not over; there has been a resurgence of cases in West Africa in recent weeks. But the White House has been forced to use Ebola funds to fight a new threat - the Zika virus now spreading rapidly across the Americas. Congress has yet to vote on funding to fight Zika - its members left for spring break without a vote - forcing the Administration to transfer $500 million in remaining Ebola funds to the Zika response. It is a gamble the White House should not have to make.Two months ago, the President made an emergency request for roughly $1.9 billion to respond to the Zika virus epidemic, which is now spreading dangerously. The World Health Organization has declared a public health emergency. It reports that Zika virus is now being spread in 33 countries in the Americas. Cases of microcephaly - abnormally small brains - in newborn babies in Brazil now exceed 1,000. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has confirmed that the Zika virus causes microcephaly at birth (see graphic), as well as other serious paralytic diseases in adults. The mosquitoes that transmit Zika virus to humans are now thought by the CDC to be present in 33 states in the mainland U.S. instead of just 12 as originally thought. As warmer weather approaches, we are facing a potential disaster if evidence-based action on a sufficient scale is not taken.   The President and the Congress did the right thing in authorizing an emergency supplemental request for $5.4 billion to combat Ebola in December 2014. The appropriation funded research on Ebola diagnostic tests, vaccines and therapeutics through the National Institutes of Health. The funds also supported an eventually successful public health response in the U.S and, most importantly, in West Africa where the epidemic raged, led by the CDC in close partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). To protect Americans, the CDC was ordered to deploy thousands of public health professionals around the U.S. and the world, including in West Africa, where each day for more than two years they put their lives on the line for us. Just as importantly, the remaining supplemental funding was now going to be used to leave behind a lasting capacity through training and support for West African countries to better prevent, detect, and respond to Ebola and other emergencies. Ebola researchers further demonstrated that when there are many thousands of cases of Ebola, even rare events become more common. Ebola had been known for more than 40 years, but the epidemic showed for the first time that it could be transmitted sexually and that survivors were left with residual health problems that have not been fully researched. The World Bank estimates the economic damage from Ebola in West Africa at $2.2 billion. It will take years to recover. Diverting resources from Ebola makes little sense -- in fact it would be like redirecting firefighters to a new house when the fire they were fighting isn't really out yet. It only takes a puff of wind for the original fire to ignite again.Congress needs to approve the money to fight Zika, and quickly. By not providing appropriate funding for U.S. government agencies, who more than earned their credibility with the American people during Ebola, Congress is gambling with both the health of unborn American children and with the health security of Americans in general. The gamble is that $500 million for Zika is sufficient when experts say it isn't, that the Zika virus won't be actively transmitted on the mainland when experts say it will, and that withdrawal from maintaining Ebola control in West Africa won't threaten health security again when experts say it could.","huffingtonpost","left","16910","zika",686

They hope at least one team will develop ""solutions to different tasks related to coping with the virus.""Each team ""will develop core-technologies related to the treatment of the Zika virus, as well as diagnosis kits that can promptly find out if a patient is infected."" South Korea has yet to record a case of Zika virus.Patients often show no symptoms with Zika, but if they do, they are mild.

"New York state officials have announced a new plan aimed at preventing the transmission of the mosquito-borne Zika virus or limiting an outbreak if the virus were to arrive in the area.Part of the plan involves trapping and testing thousands of mosquitoes in New York for Zika. Specifically, researchers will monitor the Aedes group of mosquitoes, which are the major carriers of the virus in Central and South America, where the virus is currently spreading.Although scientists have not yet determined if the type of Aedes mosquito in New York can also transmit Zika, researchers plan to trap and test about 60,000 mosquitoes in the region per month, according to a statement from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.New York will also distribute free ""Zika protection kits"" to pregnant women in regions where the virus might spread, the statement said. These kits include insect repellent, condoms (to prevent the sexual transmission of the virus) and larvicide tablets (that can kill mosquito larvae) to treat standing water. Initially, the state will give 20,000 kits to health care providers for distribution to patients.""The state is taking aggressive action to reduce the risk of Zika transmission in New York,"" Cuomo said in the statement. ""We have put in place a first-in-the-nation action plan that will work to eliminate Zika at its source, reduce potential transmissions and safeguard expectant mothers against this dangerous disease.""Although the Zika virus usually causes either mild illness or no symptoms in adults, health officials are concerned about a strong link between infection with the virus during pregnancy and microcephaly in infants.

"Could the Zika problem in the US become as bad as its been in certain places outside the US? originally appeared on Quora - the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. Answer by Amy Pope, Deputy Homeland Security Advisor to President Obama, on Quora.Zika poses a very difficult challenge and there is a lot we still don't know about the virus.However, when it comes to addressing global epidemics like this, the U.S. government has a really important leadership role to play. Our primary goal is to protect pregnant women from getting Zika and this is why we are asking Congress for approximately $1.9 billion in emergency funding to enhance our ongoing efforts to prepare for and respond to the Zika virus, both domestically and internationally.Scientists from the United States Government have developed diagnostic tests that are being used every day, and are collaborating with researchers in Zika-affected countries to rapidly increase our scientific understanding of Zika. From development of vaccines, to new approaches to mosquito control, there is much that the government can and will do.Through the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the government provides timely, evidence-based guidance that is critical in giving people the tools that they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their families.And, believe me, when it comes to protecting the American public and shoring up public health security here and across the globe, no one is more committed than President Obama to ensure the government is doing all that it can.But the federal government can't do this alone. We need states, counties, the private sector and private citizens to join these efforts.

We already get calls from people asking if it is safe to travel to Puerto Rico, considering the economic conditions. If you combine this with the CDC's advice, it could certainly influence some people not to travel,"" commented Justin Vélez-Hagan of The National Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce. He said it would likely be several months before the data was available to determine how much Puerto Rican tourism had suffered from the Zika alert.","breitbart","right","16839","zika",252
"The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean, and with the high volume of news about the virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.Here are four updates, opinions, and developments to know now:  HuffPost Brazil politics reporter Grasielle Castro took the New York Times to task last week for the paper's prejudiced portrayal of Carnival. The colorfully written Times piece critiqued revelers for ignoring the threat of Zika virus to focus on ""prodigious carnal possibilities,"" and questioned whether skimpily clad Brazilian partygoers were doing enough to protect themselves from mosquitos, the primary vector for the virus.Castro rebutted the Times' depiction in her opinion piece, pointing out that the reporter's shock at how few Brazilians were following the international recommendation to wear long sleeves and pants during the country's scorching summer heat -- which can top out at 104 degrees Fahrenheit in some cities -- was a form of U.S. media bias. Criticizing Brazilians' attire and relaxed attitude toward Zika virus misses the larger cultural context, and downplays Brazilian concern about the spreading disease, Castro argued. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent 62,000 Zika tests for pregnant women to health departments across the country and are working on producing more, the Associated Press reports. The agency warned that there could be temporary test shortages if large numbers of pregnant women, returning from travel to Zika-affected areas, want to get tested.The test is accurate if a person is actively infected with Zika, but unreliable after the virus is cleared from the person's body. Zika's extremely mild symptoms present complications, since in many cases, people don't even realize that they've had the virus at all and the moment for testing accurately passes.The World Health Organization says that researchers are ""weeks"" away from confirming that Zika virus causes microcephaly in developing fetuses, reports Reuters.Research on the possible relationship between the virus and birth defect are ongoing. The New England Journal of Medicine published a study Wednesday that showed Zika was found in the brain of an aborted fetus that had been diagnosed with microcephaly in the womb. Other small lab studies have found copies of the virus in the amniotic fluid of fetuses diagnosed with microcephaly, as well as in the blood of a microcephalic baby who died soon after birth. About 38 percent of U.S. corporations are allowing female employees to leave or postpone work in areas where Zika virus transmission is active and ongoing, reports Reuters. Only about 20 percent of corporations are giving their male employees the same consideration. Experts say that American workers probably have few legal options for resisting an international work assignment over Zika virus fears, and they may not be able to sue their employer if they do end up getting the virus, said Reuters in a previous story. While Zika virus appears to present the most danger to women who are pregnant or who want to become pregnant, the World Health Organization and the CDC have issued safe sex guidelines for men who may have been exposed to the disease as well. The virus can persist in semen for an unknown amount of time, and men run the risk of transmitting it to their partners.","huffingtonpost","left","16843","zika",745
"A Fordham University theological and social ethics professor writes that the radical left could well be using an outbreak of the Zika virus to impose its eugenicist impulses on countries that prohibit abortion.Charles C. Camosy writes in the Los Angeles Times that the ""eugenic impulse"" is ""so deeply embedded in U.S. culture that we don't even recognize it.""By way of example, he observes that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger ""insisted that the imbalance between 'the birthrate of the unfit and fit' was 'the greatest present menace to civilization.'"" Sanger, of course, believed the black race was ""unfit"" and needed to be ""eliminated,"" and the organization she spawned is the nation's largest provider of abortions - and taxpayer-funded to boot.Camosy finds it ""remarkable"" that the radical left's response is to urge abortion for a virus for which there has been as yet no scientific link to microcephaly in infants.He observes that the World Health Organization (WHO) decided Zika was a global emergency and that the disease was linked to microcephaly - even though a proven link had not been established.Camosy notes the outcome of WHO's declaration:Even if a definitive link between Zika and birth defects is determined, Camosy asserts, ""Abortion is a crude response to the possibility of microcephaly."" He notes the test for the presence of microcephaly is an ultrasound that may not pick up evidence of the disorder until the third trimester of pregnancy.""That's well after the baby can feel pain and live outside the womb, and past the point when a majority of those who identify as pro-choice are willing to accept abortions,"" he explains.Nevertheless, the notion that less than ""normal"" babies should not be allowed to survive is apparently commonplace. Camosy cites New York University bioethics program head Arthur Caplan, who notes, ""[M]ore than 85% of parents who learn through prenatal testing that a fetus has Down syndrome terminate the pregnancy.""""This despite studies that find children with Down are actually happier than those who are 'normal' and that families with such children are also disproportionately happy,"" writes Camosy. ""These facts, however, are not always shared with patients when physicians describe the possibility of having a child with Down syndrome.""Citing Pope Francis's persistent criticism of the contemporary ""throwaway culture"" of discarding the vulnerable, Camosy suggests it is time to organize ""resistance to our impulse toward eugenics.""Indeed, the use of the Zika virus to force legalization of abortion in countries that prohibit it is consistent with the same radical left's refusal to consider what might be the most sensible remedy to eliminate the source of the problem, i.e., the mosquitos that carry the virus.Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, tells Breitbart News that lifting the ban on DDT could wipe out the Zika virus.""DDT was the most effective public health weapon of all time,"" she explains, adding:""Substitute pesticides are far more toxic and expensive,"" Orient adds. ""People are advised to use insect repellents such as DEET - which is absorbed through the skin, and safety in pregnancy is not established.""Pioneer Energy president Dr. Robert Zubrin recently echoed the same idea at National Review: ""The most effective pesticide is DDT. If the Zika catastrophe is to be prevented in time, we need to use it.""Zubrin asserts that environmentalists such as Rachel Carson, author of the 1962 book Silent Spring, propagated the notion that DDT was harmful to bird populations.""This was false,"" he writes. ""In fact, by eliminating their insect parasites and infection agents, DDT was helping bird numbers to grow significantly.""Nevertheless, radical environmentalists launched an aggressive ""massive propaganda campaign"" that would ultimately ban the use of DDT.""The rush to advocate for abortion as a response to the Zika virus is grounded in ignorance and expedience,"" writes Camosy. ""If these organizations were actually interested in helping people with Zika - rather than exploiting the outbreak for a broader agenda - they would have held their fire until we know more.""It is unlikely, however, the radical left pro-abortion advocates would ""hold their fire"" until more scientific knowledge is available, since they even now refuse to acknowledge the ""science"" of the ultrasound. Organizations like Planned Parenthood and NARAL actively seek to undermine laws that would allow expectant mothers full information through viewing their babies' ultrasounds prior to making the decision to abort.The same organizations celebrate Black History Month - all the while 40 percent of pregnancies among black women end in abortion, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In fact, in New York City - home of the headquarters of Planned Parenthood - more black babies are aborted than are born. Yet, these abortion giants deny they are targeting black communities.""Instead of arrogantly insisting that developing nations must change their laws to suit someone else's ideology, abortion proponents and the media would be better served by taking a critical look at the dark tendency here and elsewhere to turn to eugenics as a solution to a problem like Zika,"" Camosy asserts.","breitbart","right","16854","zika",854
"Photo copyright Anna Wilding annawilding.net 2016 Dr Anne Schucaht and Dr FauciToday, in a White House briefing Dr Anne Schucaht, Principal Deputy Director of the Center for Disease Control said everything to do with the Zika virus is, ""Scarier than initially thought."" While Congress has all but ignored the White House administration's formal request for $1.9 billion in funding to control, prevent, and combat the Zika virus, the CDC and NHIAID have gone full speed ahead in its research to stop the virus. President Obama last week announced he had re-appropriated a small portion of the resources for Ebola to fight Zika,but this amount falls a long way short of the $1.9 Billion needed.Citing a close relationship with the pharmaceutical industry for disease vaccination and preventions, Dr. Fauci, Director of NIH/NIAID in the same press conference today was abrupt and to the point and said he needed the full $1.9 Billion. He said that if he didn't get it he would have to draw funds from other worthy areas, such as malaria, and flu vaccinations. The mosquito that carries the virus, which is the same as the Dengue and Chikungunya mosquito, is now known to be in 30 US States and territories, not just the 12, previously established. Puerto Rico is of big concerns to the CDC with a large mosquito vector there, that effects hundreds of thousands of people. Dr Schucaht also cited that American Samoa has been included for preventative kits. American Samoa is a long way from South America, where the current outbreak started. This begs the question, how did it get there, and will it now spread to other Pacific island nations? The disease was first discovered in 1947.

"The Obama administration says it doesn't expect the Zika virus to blanket whole states if and when mosquitoes begin to spread the virus on the U.S. mainland, though it wants state officials to map outbreaks so locals can protect themselves.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded nearly 700 travel-related cases in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, including nearly a dozen through sexual transmission. Yet the agency expects Zika to circulate on its own this summer, when Aedes mosquitoes flourish and start biting.In a conference call, CDC officials said transmission in the continental U.S. should be ""geographically limited"" to relatively small areas, compared with Latin America and the Caribbean.The CDC has recorded more than 1,300 locally acquired cases in the U.S. territories, mainly in Puerto Rico, and an outbreak in Brazil has been linked to an uptick in the rate of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly.Local transmission will most likely hit Texas, Florida and other states along the Gulf of Mexico, based on previous outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya, which are ferried by the same type of mosquito as Zika.But Zika is the first mosquito-borne illness to be linked to birth defects, and it has never hit the U.S. mainland before, officials said.""There's a lot we still don't know about Zika virus,"" said Peggy Honein, a CDC epidemiologist.The agency urged local officials Friday to report positive Zika tests right away and determine whether the infection is related to travel or sexual transmission. If those can be ruled out, local surveillance teams should monitor family members and surrounding households to see if the virus spreads.The CDC said it is issuing fact sheets in multiple languages to make sure people who don't speak English are aware of Zika and ways to avoid mosquito bites.The government wants to be prepared for the emerging threat, particularly after the Ebola scare of 2014, when the death of a Liberian man at a Texas hospital exposed gaps in reporting and forced states to scramble to set up quarantine rules.Dr. Robert Quigley, senior vice president and regional medical director at International SOS, a company that advises clients on global medical and security issues, said the government seems to be ahead of the private sector in its response to Zika.""I would have to say that typically, on any issue, the government tends to lag behind, just because of the bureaucracy,"" he said.He cited a February report in the Military Times that said pregnant family members of Defense Department employees or active-duty personnel stationed in affected areas could relocate voluntarily.Private-sector clients, meanwhile, are still trying to hammer out policies that protect pregnant women and other employees, while remaining competitive in their respective markets.""What they all want to know is, 'What is the benchmark, what is everyone else in our sector doing?'"" Dr. Quigley said.While the federal government outlines its policy, lawmakers on Capitol Hill have not agreed on the amount of funding needed to prepare for Zika and implement the administration's plans.President Obama in February requested nearly $2 billion to combat the virus at home and abroad, yet congressional Republican leaders have forged plans that offer much less.The Senate approved $1.1 billion in emergency funding that isn't offset with cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, and the House moved to take $622 million from the lingering Ebola response in West Africa and other health accounts to address the emerging threat.Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, urged negotiators from both chambers to fund what Mr. Obama requested.""As you know, I supported fully funding the fight against Zika with emergency funds to the amount of $1.9 billion, which was calculated by experts in federal public health agencies as the appropriate amount of funds to successfully protect the public health of our country against the imposing threat of Zika,"" Mr. Rubio wrote Thursday in a letter to all 33 conferees. ""I urge you to consider these specific requests as you negotiate the final legislation through this conference as quickly as possible."" ","washingtontimes","right","16964","zika",686
"House Democrats threw down their marker Monday in the fight over how much money is needed to fight the Zika virus, writing legislation that would fund all of President Obama's $1.9 billion request and tacking it all onto the deficit.Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat and the bill's chief sponsor, said Zika is too immediate a threat to quibble about where to find the money.They also said GOP leaders gave them no choice but to go it alone with their bill after Republicans rejected efforts to attach the money to one of the annual spending bills slated for passage later this year.""While Republicans inexplicably block action to protect America's expectant mothers from Zika, Democrats are continuing to demand the robust emergency resources American families need,"" Mrs. Pelosi said.House GOP leaders have moved more cautiously, saying they haven't received enough information from the White House about how much is needed to fight Zika, which causes birth defects and is spreading locally on Puerto Rico.Conservatives are also girding for a fight over the cost, saying any money for Zika should be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget rather than piled on the deficit for future taxpayers to handle.The House divide contrasts with bipartisan efforts in the Senate to hammer out a deal that would partially fund Mr. Obama's request. Democrats say the starting point for the talks is just over $1 billion, though GOP lawmakers haven't announced a figure.Senate Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran, Mississippi Republican, said senators will get a chance to vote on the package ""in the near future"" as an amendment to one of the chamber's fiscal 2017 spending bills.The fight over Zika joins several other ongoing funding fights. Republicans this year have resisted pressure from Democrats to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on emergencies such as the lead-tainted water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and the prescription opioids and heroin epidemic.For now the White House has shifted $510 million from the Ebola fight and $89 million from other accounts to combat Zika in the near team, as they ask the White House what it needs to fight the virus through the end of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.""In the absence of this information, the House Appropriations Committee will work with our colleagues in the House and the Senate to make our own determinations on what is needed and when, and to provide the funding that we believe is necessary and responsible,"" Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican, said last week.Though Zika isn't circulating in the states, the Centers for Disease Control has recorded 388 travel-related cases and says the virus could puncture the mainland further when temperatures climb, allowing mosquitoes that carry the disease to proliferate.The disease is already spreading locally in U.S. territories, which have reported 500 cases, mostly in Puerto Rico. Nearly 50 of the cases involved pregnant women.The Department of Health and Human Services said Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell will take a two-day trip to Puerto Rico this week to get a firsthand look at how the island is combatting the virus.She will meet with Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla, tour a blood bank and personally urge pregnant women and those of childbearing age to protect themselves against mosquito bites that could lead to infection.Mr. Obama's Zika request includes $250 million to bolster Puerto Rico's Medicaid program since its funding is capped and the island theoretically cannot respond as easily to emergencies. ","washingtontimes","right","16916","zika",581
"Concerns have mounted since the World Health Organization declared the mosquito-borne Zika virus an ""international public health emergency"", but those concerns may turn into panic and an economic disaster with the mutating Zika virus becoming a ""sexually transmitted infection.""Media reports have improperly described the symptoms of mosquito-borne Zika virus infection in adults as similar to a rash and fever, with some aches and pains-a mild version of its viral cousins: dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile Disease.The biggest concern highlighted has been a possible link to a rare birth defect called microcephaly, which results in babies born with unusually small heads, normally affecting about 12 out of 10,000 live births.Zika virus was originally discovered in Uganda 69 years ago. Over the decades, it has caused modest discomfort during small and sporadic localized outbreaks in the tropics.But the current outbreak was first reported in Brazil last May, when doctors noticed the number of babies suffering microcephaly had exploded over 20-fold to 240 cases per 10,000 live births.The outbreak has since spread to pandemic levels in 20 countries stretching from Brazil to Mexico. Every continent on the planet, except Antarctica, have now also documented multiple cases of Zika virus.Flaminia Catteruccia, Associate Professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, has stated that the new Zika strain demonstrates the virus has adapted to the human environment by mutating to become ""more pathogenic to humans.""She suspects this means a mutation of the Zika virus is the ""causative agent"" behind the frightening outbreak of ""Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disease of the nervous system now on the rise among adults in Brazil."" Normally considered a very rare tropical disease, there have been hundreds of Guillain-Barré cases reported in northern Brazil over the last few months.The first symptom of Guillain-Barré include a weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. The symptoms can slowly increase in intensity to paralysis-first in the legs, then slowly spreading to the arms, and then the face and the rest of the body. Finally, the patient begins to suffer life-threatening interference with breathing.The World Health Organization has recommended personal protective measures, including well-screened houses, mosquito nets, long-sleeved clothing and liberal amounts of bug spray.Poor countries in the Americas have also quietly asked for aid to pay for mass overhead spraying as part of mosquito-eradication efforts-similar to those carried out in the mid-20th century. But the Obama Administration has been slow to issue funding due to concerns that environmental groups would protest that such efforts destroy natural habitats.With 4 million new Zika cases expected in South and Central America this year, there are economic concerns that fears about the spread of Zika to America will threaten the $548 billion in U.S. trade with Mexico and Brazil.The Center for Disease Control confirmed on February 3 that a Dallas case of Zika was due to sexually transmitted infection (STI). If Zika-or a possibly mutated strain-can also spread through sex, then it poses a risk of another HIV/Aids pandemic.Officials in L.A. County confirmed Wednesday that while there has only been one locally confirmed case of Zika in the latest outbreak, several other patients are being tested for the disease, the Los Angeles Times reports.","breitbart","right","16835","zika",553
"We'll save your children... for a price.It's not enough for Republicans to hijack Zika funding and use it as an excuse to gut the Clean Water Act. Before they'll agree to save the lives of both children and adults threatened by Zika, they want another payment. Only this payment is also in lives.Truck driver Dana Logan tried on Wednesday to recount a crash that decapitated two fathers and two children, hoping to convince Congress to stop weakening rules that require truckers to get rest.She couldn't do it. A dozen years after the fatigued driver of another truck fell asleep and drove into an SUV stuck in traffic behind her rig on a Texas highway, Logan was still too devastated to finish talking about it. What the Logans and other safety advocates are worried about are measures that would allow truck drivers to work more than 80 hours a week, tacked onto to separate appropriations bills in the House and the Senate.So guess which bill? It's a bill that not only provides major infrastructure funding, but also happens to be where the funding to fight Zika is attached. Why did the Republican leadership decide to glue important funding measures together? Because that makes it a perfect vessel to carry anything they want. Anything at all.The new inserted policy provisions represent a trend over the last three years of trucking industry interests using must-pass spending bills to win regulatory concessions that are opposed by most safety advocates and likely could not pass as normal stand-alone bills. In this case, not only do the bills fund major parts of the government, they provide cash to fight Zika.Hey, nice little government you've got there. And you value your babies, right?

"Microcephalic Babies Are Tied to Zika viral infections during their first 3 months of fetal development.

Mosquitoes can bite infected people and then bite others, transmitting Zv to new people.Zv, related to dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses, is kept alive via a wild host population in Africa. Immunized people are no longer hosts, but sources are maintained in wild animals that carry the virus. The Current Spread of Zika Virus. Source Center for Disease Control and PreventionMosquitoes Transmit Zika Virus, but the sources are in animals that carry the virus. Credit James Gathany at Wikimedia Commons*Ultimately, widespread vaccination within human populations will likely keep Zv to manageable levels, but not wipe it out. Those same mosquitoes will probably infect American animals, which will be American carrier hosts. Such animals carry the live virus in their blood on a long-term basis, and are perpetual sources of it. Knowing which species are carriers and killing them all off simply isn't feasible.No vaccines exist yet, although manufacturers say one could be available for emergency use by October 2016.

"Research by scientists in Brazil indicates that a mosquito more common than the one primarily known to transmit Zika infections may possibly be able to carry the virus, a development that could further complicate efforts to limit its spread.The mosquito species Aedes aegypti has been identified as the main transmitter of Zika infections, which have been linked to thousands of birth defects as the virus spreads rapidly in Brazil and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.But the scientists in Brazil announced on Wednesday that they were able to infect another species, Culex quinquefasciatus, with the virus in a laboratory, raising concerns that Zika could be carried by a species more prevalent than Aedes aegypti. They said much more research is needed to learn whether the Culex mosquitoes can transmit Zika infections.In Brazil, Culex quinquefasciatus is 20 times more common than Aedes aegypti, the researchers said.The research, conducted by scientists at the government-funded Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in the northeastern city of Recife, is part of an ongoing trial in which researchers injected 200 of the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes with rabbit blood infected by Zika.The virus, they said, circulated through the mosquitoes' bodies and into their salivary glands, meaning they might be able to transmit a Zika infection by biting a person.""We saw an ease of infection and an ease of dissemination of the virus to the salivary glands,"" Constancia Ayres, the lead scientist in the study, told Globo, Brazil's leading television network.Public health authorities have cited Aedes aegypti as the mosquito overwhelming responsible for spreading Zika, with another species of the same genus, Aedes albopictus, also transmitting the virus in smaller numbers.There has been evidence about other mosquitoes linked to Zika. For example, researchers have found more than 20 mosquito species carrying the virus in Africa, although it was unclear whether they all transmit the disease effectively to humans.The Brazilian research has yet to be published in a scientific journal or reviewed by scientific peers elsewhere.The foundation said more work was needed to determine whether Culex mosquitoes in the wild already are carrying the virus as well as whether they can transmit Zika infections.Foundation spokeswoman Fabiola Tavares on Thursday said the researchers, who will begin capturing Culex mosquitoes in areas near Recife where the virus is known to be circulating, will now proceed toward answering those questions. The additional research could take up to eight months, Tavares added.If a mosquito besides Aedes aegypti were found to transmit Zika infections in large numbers, it could make it more difficult to contain the current Zika outbreak that the World Health Organization last month declared a global public health emergency.Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems.Brazil said it has confirmed more than 640 cases of microcephaly, and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating more than 4,200 additional suspected cases of microcephaly.Traces of Zika virus have been found in the bodily fluids and tissue of mothers and babies affected by microcephaly.Culex quinquefasciatus also exists in more temperate climes, such as the southern United States, where it is known to carry the West Nile virus, and can survive winters. Unlike Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus could keep a virus in circulation during cold months.Though the Culex mosquitoes prefer to feed on the blood of birds, they also commonly bite humans, especially in rural areas. That means that targeted pesticide use and other mosquito control efforts for that species, which rests in trees and other high areas, would need to be different from those for Aedes aegypti, which rests in low spots, often indoors.""You can't spray up high the way you can around buildings,"" said Grayson Brown, director of the University of Kentucky's public health entomology laboratory who was not involved in the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation research.If Culex mosquitoes were indeed proven to transmit Zika, Brown said, ""it would really complicate the public health issue.""(Reporting by Paulo Prada; Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London; Editing by Will Dunham)","huffingtonpost","left","16864","zika",727
"On Monday the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added four countries and territories to its growing list of places with active Zika virus transmissions, which means that the cases occurred locally, rather than in travelers returning from a place where they acquired the virus.So far, no local cases of Zika have been reported in the United States. The virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   With the high volume of news about the Zika virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps. Here's the latest information you should know as of Tuesday afternoon: ""Eighty percent of the people infected by Zika do not develop significant symptoms,"" Marcelo Castro, Brazil's health minister, told Reuters. ""A large number of people have the virus with no symptoms, so the situation is more serious that we can imagine.""Local governments in Brazil will be required to report Zika cases next week, after they have the proper lab equipment for testing. The Brazilian government said there is no chance that the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro will be called off because of the outbreak. ""Our big hope is finding a vaccine,"" Castro said. Zika virus symptoms are so mild that many people don't know they are infected at all. This makes developing a vaccine more complicated, Reuters reports. Effective vaccines produce a strong but not-too-strong immune response in order to work, a marker difficult to assess in an all-but-symptomless infection.""To be useful, a Zika vaccine would need to be effective and safe, but it's difficult to do both,"" Ben Neuman, an expert on viruses at Britain's University of Reading told Reuters. ""It's a balancing act.""Four new countries and territories joined the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's list of 28 regions of active Zika virus transmission, where the CDC says American travelers are at risk being infected with the virus.Wolbachia bacteria, which are common in mites, spiders, nematodes and insects, are being studied as a way to block viral transmissions of dengue, an illness in the same genus as Zika virus. Still, scientists don't know enough about Zika yet to assess if such a tool would be effective at fighting Zika-carrying mosquitos.In the United States, approximately 25,000 babies are diagnosed each year with microcephaly, a birth defect characterized by an abnormally small head, which can be an indication of brain damage. Down syndrome, maternal diabetes and alcohol consumption during pregnancy have all been linked to the birth defect. But with a spotlight on Zika in Brazil, researchers are increasingly exploring the link between microcephaly and infections such as toxoplasmosis, German measles and cytomegalovirus, according to the New York Times.","huffingtonpost","left","16833","zika",634

The GM mosquitos could stem Zika's spread by releasing sterile male insects, who diminish the mosquito's population when they fail to reproduce. Another potential strategy is injecting Wolbachia bacteria into the mosquitos; the bacteria doesn't affect humans, but prevents female mosquitos' eggs from hatching if they mate with an infected male mosquito.But environmentalists warn of unintended consequences: Controlling insects by genetically modifying them and eliminating an entire species of mosquitos could affect the world's delicate ecosystem in unforeseen ways. Vector control experts disagree.""This is an invasive species, so getting rid of these mosquitoes would, if anything, restore the natural ecology, not destroy it,"" Jo Lines of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told Reuters. In reality, the technology is so new that the long term-consequences are anyone's guess. ""You would hope that the ecology would just return to how it was before this mosquito arrived,"" Line's colleague Jimmy Whitworth, an infectious disease expert, told the Associated Press. ""But there's no way of knowing that for sure.""After a group of Argentinean doctors raised concerns that larvicide in drinking water, not Zika virus, may be to blame for birth defects, the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul stopped treating water with pyriproxyfen, the active ingredient named in the doctors' report, reports the Wall Street Journal. Brazilian and U.S. health authorities denounced the report, published by the group Red Universitária de Ambiente y Salud (University Network of Environment and Health), which is not based on lab studies or research of any kind. U.S. health officials like Dr. Francis Collins and Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health emphasized that there is strong evidence suggesting the Zika virus is involved in the microcephaly birth defects. Scientists have yet to definitively confirm that the virus causes birth defects, though the World Health Organization says we're ""weeks"" away from confirmation.  The first case of Zika virus in Colombia wasn't detected until October 2015, so most pregnant women who have contracted the virus haven't carried their pregnancies to term at this point. But already, the country provides a strong contrast to Brazil, where strict abortion laws prevent women from terminating pregnancies, even in the case of Zika infection. Doctors in Colombia, meanwhile, are performing legal abortions for pregnant women who contract Zika, the New York Times reports.Still, it's a difficult choice for nearly 3,000 pregnant Colombians, many of whom don't support abortion for religious reasons, and especially since there haven't been any Colombian babies born with the birth defect microcephaly -- yet. For now, abortions in Colombia are uncommon, and Colombian health officials are advising women to delay pregnancy until more is known about the suspected link between Zika virus and microcephaly. Six pregnant women in Mexico have Zika virus, according to the Mexican health ministry, marking the first cases of the virus in pregnant women reported in the country. Four of the six cases were reported in Chiapas, a poor state in southern Mexico, where more than half of the country's Zika virus cases have been detected so far, according to Reuters. The countries and territories under travel alert by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are: American Samoa, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Samoa, Suriname, Tonga, Venezuela and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  ","huffingtonpost","left","16847","zika",835
"*** SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON ***Donate Today!For more coverage of Hillary Clinton at Daily Kos, visit the Hillary Writers Circle. For breaking news, follow First Amendment.This weekend edition of Hillary News & Views begins with some long overdue analysis of the voters who are supporting the candidate who has gotten the most votes from either party so far.The New Republic reports on ""The Hillary Voter"":The voter we almost never hear about, however, is the Clinton voter. Which is surprising, since Hillary Clinton has won more votes in the primaries than any other candidate so far. She has amassed over 2.5 million more votes than Sanders; over 1.1 million more votes than Trump. Clearly Clinton voters exist, yet there has been very little analysis as to who they are or why they are showing up to vote for her. Sure, there has been talk of Clinton's dominance among African-American voters, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic voters. Her voters seem to skew older and more affluent. But these are demographics. (And even demographics have a hard time explaining her commanding win in Ohio, or her wins in Massachusetts and Missouri.) There is almost no discussion of what is motivating these voters. If anything, the media seems to think they are holding their noses as they vote for Hillary. As a recent New York Times article suggested, Clinton is winning ""votes, not hearts.""We never hear that Hillary Clinton has ""momentum""-what she has is a ""sizable delegate lead."" No one this cycle has described Clinton supporters as ""fired up""-it's simply not possible that people are fired up for Hillary. No, what we gather about Clinton from the press is that she can't connect. She has very high unfavorable ratings. People think she is dishonest and untrustworthy. She is not a gifted politician. She is a phony. Hated by so many. The list goes on.An examination of Clinton voters and their motivations might reveal that the narrative that most media outlets have been feeding us this election cycle is dubious at best. Because if the biggest vote-getter of either party is Hillary-by a large margin-then that suggests the electorate is not necessarily as angry as pundits claim. It further suggests that perhaps some people are tired of hearing about how angry they are, and are quietly asserting their opinions at the ballot box. If Democrats are so angry, Clinton would not be in the position she is today. Is it really so farfetched to claim that quite a few Democrats aren't voting for Sanders precisely because he seems angry? Which isn't to suggest that people aren't angry-certainly many Republican primary voters seem to be. Rather, it is to suggest that voters who aren't angry are still showing up at the polls, despite being ignored in news stories.So perhaps Clinton voters don't show up at rallies so much. Perhaps they are a bit less passionate on Facebook, share fewer articles, give less money to their candidate (she does have a super PAC, after all). But what they are doing is perhaps the only thing that actually matters in an election. They are showing up to vote. In numbers that no other candidate can boast. It's certainly curious to presume, as many do, that Clinton's supporters are somehow less enthusiastic than Sanders's are. How is enthusiasm measured, if not by actual vote count? And they are doing so despite the media narrative surrounding their candidate, despite hearing very little about themselves in the media, despite her ""damn"" emails, despite Benghazi, despite her low Gallup favorables, and despite how everyone else is ""Feeling the Bern."" If anything, Clinton might need to thank the press for consistently underestimating her. Perhaps this is why her supporters are coming out for her in such strength: to assert their existence in the face of a narrative that both overlooks them and disparages their candidate.Roll Call reports:There's been a lot of talk about an enthusiasm gap between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in this election cycle: Every Democrat wants to vote for him and some reluctantly vote for her.At least, that's how the narrative goes. And it's easy to believe if you're a millennial-because it's pretty true among your cohort-or, like many journalists, you spend a lot of time with elite white dudes.But there's another subset of the electorate that has been the story of the Democratic primary campaign: African-American women. More than any other demographic group, black women are the reason Hillary Clinton has racked up a 2 million-vote lead on Bernie Sanders and, more important, a 300-point advantage among pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention.The bedrock of her winning campaign is African-American women, and, as a group, these women seem pretty damn determined to vote for her.""They are the absolute heart of the party,"" Jaime Harrison, the South Carolina Democratic Party chairman said of African-American women in a comment posted on Sidewire (the political communication platform I work for). ""Hillary is their BFF.""But it's not unusual for Clinton to rely on African-American women. Over the years, her top aides have included Maggie Williams and Cheryl Mills, owners of two of the sharpest minds in the political world.Without getting too deep into the intricacies of delegate math, areas with high concentrations of reliably Democratic voters - think big cities with significant minority populations - award more delegates than regions of a state that provide fewer votes for Democratic candidates. That makes black women-who are more likely to vote than black men-a key to any Democratic presidential primary hopeful's success.What does all that mean?It means Clinton owes her standing in the Democratic race not just to African-American voters but, more specifically, to African-American women. More than any other set of voters, black women are propelling Clinton toward the general election. In the primary, that's the most compelling enthusiasm-gap - even if it's getting a lot less attention.And, most important for Clinton, having an energized and mobilized base of African American women could be the key to winning swing states such as Florida, Virginia and North Carolina in November.","dailykos","left","16879","zika",1035
"President Obama's top health official will visit Puerto Rico this week to get a firsthand look at how the island is combating the Zika virus, a trip that coincides with Senate efforts to partially fund President Obama $1.9 billion request for emergency funding to stave off the mosquito-borne illness.On a two-day trip, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell will meet with Puerto Rican Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla, tour a blood bank and personally urge pregnant women and those of childbearing age to protect themselves against mosquito bites that could lead to infection.Zika is causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Though it isn't circulating on the U.S. mainland, the territories have reported 500 cases of locally acquired Zika, mostly in Puerto Rico. Nearly 50 of the cases involved pregnant women.Mrs. Burwell's tour will be the administration's third high-profile visit to the island this year.Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, visited in March to address Zika, and Treasury Jacob J. Lew met with local officials in January to discuss the island's $70 billion debt - a crisis that threatens basic health services for its 3.5 million residents.Congress is working on a bill that would rescue Puerto Rico from its debt woes by imposing a fiscal oversight board and setting up a mechanism to restructure the island's debts. Both parties have faulted aspects of the bill, however, delaying action on Capitol Hill.At the same time, senators are nearing a deal to pony up hundreds of millions to combat Zika at home and abroad.Mr. Obama's Zika request includes $250 million to bolster Puerto Rico's Medicaid program, since its funding is capped and the island theoretically cannot respond as easily to emergencies. ","washingtontimes","right","16916","zika",299
"A new study has allowed scientists to watch the Zika virus destroy nascent brain cells in mice fetuses, proving definitively the link between the virus and birth defects in humans as well as cementing suspicions that the strain of Zika spreading in Latin America is a more dangerous mutation than those seen previously.Three teams of scientists independently conducted different studies on mice fetuses, Reuters notes, all finding similar damage to unborn mice whose mothers are injected with Zika. The scientists watched under microscopes as the virus spread into the fetuses' brains and began to destroy them before the unborn mouse could properly develop. Signs of microcephaly in cases where the virus was introduced later in development were common; in those in which Zika was introduced in the earlier stages of a pregnancy, the fetus died before being born.Results of one of these studies, published in the journal Nature, also compared the damage caused by the long-known strain of Zika originating in Africa to that caused by the virus currently spreading in Latin America and native to the South Pacific. The African strain - which, due to its presence being known for decades, is more commonly available in sample form for scientists to conduct experiments with - caused significantly less damage in the unborn mice than the Latin American strain.""Our findings support the hypothesis that microcephaly is a distinctive feature of recent Zika virus Asian-lineage virus, which originated in the Pacific and is now spreading in South and Central America,"" the Brazilian researcher Patricia Beltrão-Braga wrote in her study. Such a mutation in the virus would help explain why the reaction towards the virus in Brazil, Colombia, and other affected areas was initially so muted: The Zika doctors knew it was not as great a threat.""The Zika virus is not as terrible as dengue or chikungunya. Patients do not die as a result of contracting it,"" wrote Gubio Soares, the medical researcher who first identified Zika's presence in Brazil, last year. His assertion still stands regarding most Zika patients, who do not experience any symptoms at all. But for pregnant mothers in affected regions, Zika has become a serious threat to the viability of their unborn children.The latest studies on mice also confirm that Zika, and not other potential factors, definitively causes brain deformities.Alarm over the potential of a Zika outbreak in North America is growing as the weather warms in the Southern Hemisphere and Brazil, the epicenter of the Latin American outbreak, prepares for hundreds of thousands of tourists to descend upon it for this year's Summer Olympics. Some in the public health community are calling for Brazil to postpone the games, or the International Olympic Commission to move the games to an unaffected area. ""Mass migration into the heart of an outbreak is a public health no-brainer,"" University of Ottawa Professor Amir Attaran writes in the latest issue of the Harvard Public Health Review. Brazilian soccer legend Rivaldo has discouraged tourists from going to the Olympic games, citing both disease and rampant crime as threats.The Brazilian government has made efforts to end the outbreak, including the largest troop deployment in the nation's history to clear still-water deposits and educate families on how to avoid the disease. But the president who ordered the deployment, Dilma Rousseff, has been impeached and removed from office, and the number of Zika cases in Brazil is nearing six figures. With experts estimating that up to two billion people worldwide are at risk of exposure to Zika, many are wondering whether Brazil can do enough to keep the Olympics safe.The World Health Organization (WHO) has stood by Brazil, issuing a statement this week that the organization is ""confident"" that Brazil will be able to deliver a safe and enjoyable fortnight of games. Its statements echo those of the International Olympic Commission, which has expressed an optimistic view that the cooler weather in August will help lower the mosquito population and make contracting Zika in Rio de Janeiro more difficult.","breitbart","right","16933","zika",677
"Doctors in Brazil have discovered hydrocephalus in two babies with congenital malformation. Some suspect the ongoing Zika pandemic in the country caused these cases.""It is not usual, in cases of congenital infection, to have microcephaly that develops into hydrocephalus,"" said Dr. Vanessa Van Der Linden, a doctor in Recife, Pernambuco. ""It serves as a warning. Now we need to investigate to understand what mechanism triggered hydrocephalus.""Doctors define hydrocephalus as a ""buildup of fluid in the cavities (ventricles) deep with the brain."" The excess fluid puts too much pressure on the brain, which ""can damage brain tissues and cause a large spectrum of impairments in brain function.""Medical professionals performed surgery on one child, aged three months. They inserted a valve to drain the fluid from the baby's head.Pernambuco state said it is too soon to connect hydrocephalus to Zika. The Brazilian Health Ministry admitted that ""these are not the first reported cases and that, so far, there is no evidence [of a] relationship with Zika.""The Zika outbreak has led to numerous discoveries of microcephaly, which occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth. The disorder results in a small head with side effects such as seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, feeding problems, and visual problems.The CDC states rubella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, severe malnutrition, alcohol, drugs, and toxic chemicals can cause microcephaly.Brazil has discovered more than 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases compared to the 147 in 2014. Doctors reported 404 cases of microcephaly in newborns since November. They tied seventeen ""to the Zika virus."" Fifteen of the 404 passed away, ""with five linked to Zika."" Authorities are investigating 56 other deaths and 3,670 cases.In Seattle, a family shared their experience with microcephaly after the outbreak brought attention to the disorder. Doctors diagnosed their daughter Isla Rose with microcephaly. Her mother ""contracted CMV during pregnancy."" The microcephaly caused hydrocephalus in Isla, along with ""profound hearing loss."" The two-year-old cannot ""hold up her own head, had poor muscle tone and must use a feeding tube."" A doctor advised to couple to have an abortion, but they said no.Planned Parenthood and leftist activists have argued that easier access to abortion will help contain the damage the Zika virus is causing in Latin America.""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,"" sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy wrote in O Globo.Fear of microcephaly or other complications due to Zika has pushed women to choose illegal abortions. Doctors indicate women in all social classes are seeking out these abortions ""in despair over the possibility of deformity."" Some even go through with abortions without concrete proof of complications.Doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester or after birth:Brazil has outlawed abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, and a judge must approve each case.The Brazilian Conference of Catholic Bishops has rejected the left's attempt to promote abortion in areas affected by Zika.The bishops acknowledge the ""virus deserves special attention by its probable link to microcephaly,"" but insist it is unacceptable to immediately jump to abortion.""The alert, however, should not panic us,"" they wrote. ""Nor use it to justify abortion for cases of microcephaly as proposed regrettably by certain groups that organize to take the matter to the Supreme Court, a total disrespect for the gift of life.""","breitbart","right","16846","zika",603
"By now, unless you've been living under a (mosquito-free) rock, you've likely heard of the Zika virus, the risks associated with a pregnant woman getting Zika and children being born with severe birth defects. Microcephaly, a condition in which a child is born with an under-developed brain and skull, has been the condition getting the most attention: one study suggests the rate can be as high as 13 percent of children born to women infected with Zika while pregnant. The rates of other birth defects (such as defects in the urinary or gastrointestinal tracts) could be even higher. In children and adults, Zika also may rarely cause Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a neurological condition that can temporarily cause weakness and even paralysis.So what do you do? Everyone needs to do their part to reduce the risk of Zika, but if you're a considering pregnancy in the next few months, whether you're a woman or a partner, you really need to pay attention. Without a vaccine, preventing the mosquito bite in the first place is the only defense we have.Dump (and scrub away) standing water - Female Aedes mosquitos (the ones that carry Zika) lay hundreds of eggs at a time, along the walls of containers filled with water. That includes potted plants, swimming pools with inadequate filters, toys or even trash containers. It takes about a week for eggs to hatch, so once a week, dump out these containers - and scrub their sides - to remove any adherent eggs.Protect the septic tank - OK, after I learned this, I was so grossed out, but we need to do this for all mosquitos, whether or not Zika is a threat. Apparently, mosquitos like to lay eggs in septic tanks, too. Make sure you don't have any broken/cracked/spaces between blocks covering your septic tanks and put screen covers (mesh wires too small for mosquitos) over any ventilation pipes coming from the tank. Got an abandoned septic tank? Fill it with dirt.Ensure all windows have intact screens or use the AC. This isn't the year for wide-opened windows, curtains billowing in the wind. Aedes mosquitos bite during the day and in the evening, so make sure screens are intact. A cool air-conditioned house will also be unfriendly to mosquitos, which like it nice and warm.Watch your travel. While the Aedes mosquito is predicted to be in the Southern U.S. and along the East Coast by this summer, right now the CDC recommends that people considering children in the near future stay away from the Aedes' home base: Central and South America, the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean. Check out the CDC Travel Advisory for up-to-date info.Practice safe sex. Don't have unprotected intercourse with a male who has traveled to one of these countries for three weeks (and wait six months if he knows he developed Zika). According to the CDC, Zika can be passed via sexual transmission, and there are 11 such cases in the U.S. already.Repel, repel, repel! According to the CDC, our two best repellant bets are DEET (10-30 percent; 10 percent is only effective for about 2 hours, 24 percent gives you around 5 hours) or Picaridin (stick to 20 percent to have the same efficacy as DEET), and can be applied directly to skin.Roll out the anti-Zika wardrobe. Yes, I said it. Those funny-looking repellant clothes you've seen in outdoors catalogs? Better stock up this summer! Wear long sleeves and pants treated with Permethrin - spraying for 30-45 seconds and allowing to dry fully before wearing (Don't apply Permethrin to skin-just clothing.)Combine defenses. According to the CDC, the best repellant protection is a combination - wear permethrin-treated clothing in long sleeves and pants, and then apply a DEET or Picaridin repellant to any small skin-exposed.Want more updates?

"UPDATE: Feb. 12 -- Hawaii Gov. David Ige signed a statewide emergency proclamation on Friday to fight mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue fever and Zika.The measure will give the state access to disaster funds and the option of suspending regulations to expedite its response. It also allows the state to seek federal assistance if it needs additional resources, the governor said in a statement.""There have been no locally acquired Zika cases in the U.S. or Hawaii, and we'd like to keep it that way,"" Ige said. ""This is about getting in front of the situation across the state.""Ige's statewide proclamation comes days after the Big Island -- where an outbreak of dengue has been ongoing for months -- declared its own state of emergency. The mayor of Hawaii's Big Island declared a state of emergency on Monday amid the state's largest outbreak of dengue fever since the 1940s.The move comes more than three months after the state Department of Health confirmed the first cases of locally acquired dengue, and less than a week after state and county officials defended the ongoing response against criticism that they had been slow to act.Much like Zika virus, dengue fever is a viral illness spread by mosquitoes. While it is not endemic to Hawaii, the state does have the mosquito species capable of transmitting the disease. As of Monday, the Hawaii Department of Health had confirmed 251 cases of dengue on the Big Island, including 227 infected Hawaii Island residents and 24 visitors.Symptoms include fever, rash, joint or muscle pain, headache, or pain behind the eyes. Though often debilitating, the symptoms can be effectively managed if recognized and treated. The virus, nicknamed ""breakbone fever,"" can develop into a more severe form called dengue hemorrhagic fever that can be fatal if left untreated. Hawaii County's emergency proclamation, signed by Hawaii County Mayor Billy Kenoi, does little by itself. It temporarily suspends a county law that prohibits people from disposing of tires -- known breeding sites for mosquitoes -- at county landfills.As West Hawaii Today reports, the declaration opens the way for Hawaii Gov. David Ige to make his own emergency declaration, which would provide state funds for mosquito-control efforts.Ige said late Monday he supported Hawaii Island's efforts to ""break the cycle of dengue fever infection and transmission."" The state, he said in a statement, would declare an emergency if the outbreak requires additional resources, spreads to other islands or expands to include Zika or other vector-borne disease. In a December assessment of Hawaii's response to the dengue outbreak, Lyle Petersen, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, said there were ""critical deficiencies"" in the state Health Department that should be ""urgently addressed."" The state said it's working to release $250,000 to the state Health Department to fund eight vector-control positions, one entomologist and one communications position.U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is among those who have urged Ige to declare a state of emergency over the dengue outbreak and to devote additional resources into fighting its spread, including National Guard medical personnel.Ige has defended state and county leaders against criticism that the response has been slow.""Mayor Kenoi and his team on the Big Island have been on it from the first report,"" Ige said on Feb. 2, according to a Hawaii Tribune-Herald report. ""They've done a terrific job of engaging the communities and engaging us, and we've been cooperating with them from the beginning, providing the resources that they need to ensure that we can respond on behalf of the people.""Hawaii's tropical environment, which allows dengue-carrying mosquitoes to thrive, makes it especially prone to outbreaks of the virus. The current outbreak is the first locally acquired cluster in Hawaii since four people contracted dengue on Oahu in 2011. ","huffingtonpost","left","16839","zika",662
"By Sabra L. Klein, PhD, Associate Professor of Molecular Microbiology Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public HealthPregnant women are more susceptible to infectious disease than the general public. Yet a dearth of research leaves them and their babies vulnerable time and time again.Like millions of other women in the U.S, when I was pregnant my doctor told me to avoid changing cat litter, eating soft cheeses, and shaking hands with anyone who was sick -- basically to avoid exposure to infection. While many pregnant women may not know about the biology underpinning this common advice, scientists and doctors are well aware that being pregnant creates an environment in women's bodies that makes them more susceptible to infection. And yet, every time a new outbreak occurs -- whether it's been the H1N1Influzena (Swine Flu), Ebola, or now Zika -- doctors and public health officials are hard pressed to address the danger to pregnant women and their fetuses. When an outbreak eventually subsides, scientists, doctors, and public health officials are still left wondering what made pregnant women and their fetuses so susceptible to infection-- a question that almost always remains unanswered. Zika continues to be a case in point. ""As the weeks and months go by we learn more and more, and realize how much we don't know,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""And unfortunately the more we learn, the worse things seem to get."" Meanwhile, obstetricians and their patients, understandably worried, demand more than travel warnings and promises of a yet-to-come vaccine. To get ahead of the next pandemic and the pattern of panic that we all know too well, our reactionary approach must change. Governments, which act on behalf of their people, must advocate and fund the study of infectious diseases -- viral and non-viral -- during pregnancy so that we can pinpoint which of these infections cause harm to the mother and which are able to cross the placenta and damage the fetus. We need to base our public health policy recommendations on scientific facts that could bridge across epidemics and enable us to manage new crises when they arise. Pregnant women are not included in most medical research for a reason. Researchers and those funding the research are fearful of harming a fetus. Though understandable, this is not an excuse for inaction. Research can, and should, be done using pregnant animal models, such as mice, or cell cultures from placentas to search for answers. We should also use these ""pregnancy models"" to investigate how pregnant females and their fetuses would respond to treatments, such as drugs or vaccines, for infectious diseases. If more research on pregnancy occurred early in the drug discovery pipeline, then we would be better prepared to safely treat pregnant women when new infectious diseases surface. Much of the information about infectious diseases and pregnant women comes from observations during outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics, which have illustrated the disastrous results of not knowing enough information. During the influenza pandemic of 2009, pregnant women were hospitalized at a much higher rate than the general public. This tells us that they were getting a more severe version of the disease -- something that perhaps could have been predicted in a lab. Similar observations have been made during malaria outbreaks and during the Ebola epidemic in Africa. The alternative to doing the research and getting ahead of these outbreaks is what we've witnessed in the past month: an uneven response that differs based on geography. ""Don't get pregnant"" is not a sustainable public health message to address an epidemic. Yet, this was the advice delivered to women in about a half dozen Latin American and Caribbean nations, in response to Zika's suspected link to birth defects in Brazil. Women have long been treated as afterthoughts in medical research, most notably with cardiovascular disease, in which research was historically heavily weighted toward men even though more women die from it. With pregnant women, the neglect is even worse, but we can take systematic steps to shine a research light on pregnancy, and we must not wait for the next pandemic before we commit ourselves to this task. By failing to take action in the lab and at the highest levels of government, we're leaving women and their babies to be the guinea pigs during each inevitable new outbreak. We need more than a Zika czar, as several members of Congress have suggested. We need a U.S. women's health czar -- someone who will take a longer view and prioritize sustained research on infectious diseases in pregnant women. Only with this type of focus and effort will we be able to acquire the tools and know-how to manage and advise pregnant women during the next outbreak, which we know is a matter of when, not if.The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR®) has been advocating for more than 25 years to bring more awareness to understanding sex differences in infectious diseases, leading to personalized treatment and prevention.

"Officials in San Antonio, Texas, worry that Zika virus may pose a serious threat to the local blood supply. They held a press conference Monday to address these concerns.South Texas Blood and Tissue Center (STBTC) CEO Elizabeth Waltman cautioned: ""Should Zika become widespread in Texas or other parts of the U.S., we will need to be supporting each other to ensure there is enough blood.""In addition to Waltman, San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor, Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff, officials from the San Antonio Metro Health Department and Chamber of Commerce, plus the U.S. Air Force participated in the press conference. Health officials urged residents to donate blood now while the supply is not tainted by Zika, meaning no local mosquitoes carry and transmit the virus.The press conference also followed a week of torrential rain storms statewide where resulting standing water often proves to be breeding grounds for mosquitoes, in general, especially in warmer weather, now a heightened concern because of Texas' proximity to Mexico, where local mosquitoes now carry and transmit Zika virus.""We want to make sure that San Antonio residents dump any standing water near their homes at least once a week. Treat standing water that can't be dumped with purification tablets,"" commented Wolff, according to San Antonio's KSAT 12.Breitbart Texas reported the related fear is that Zika-carrying mosquitoes will cross over the border and infect Texans and Texas mosquitoes. Officials predict it is only a matter of time before a locally transmitted Zika case occurs and once this happens, it could pose a serious threat to the current blood supply, already suffering a shortage.STBTC launched a Now More Than Ever campaign to encourage San Antonio residents to give blood, mainly because donations are down overall not just in San Antonio but around the country. The organization's website notes the trade association for U.S. blood banks, the AABB, cited its most 2013 current statistics that blood donations were at the lowest point since they began keeping records in 1980, showing only 67 out of 1,000 people nationwide donated blood that year. ""The national trend shows blood donations at the lowest level in 30 years,"" commented Waltman.This is compounded by Zika virus because it forced San Antonio health officials to turn away much needed blood donors, even if only temporarily. STBTC adopted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) guidelines mandating potential blood donors who return from travel to Zika affected areas and those who display symptoms characteristic with the virus, wait one month before donating blood.STBTC actually asks potential blood donors who traveled to Zika affected regions such as in South Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South Americas, or Mexico to wait 28 days upon returning before donating blood, even though there are no known cases of individuals infected with Zika though local mosquitoes in the state of Texas. Additionally, prospective donors who have had sexual contact with a person who just returned from travel to a Zika infested area must wait 28 days, since the virus also spreads through sexual contact. It can spread via blood transfusions as well.""It's a big impact on our supply and the availability of blood for people who are sick, going through chemotherapy, and people who are injured,"" said Julie Vera, STBTC spokeswoman, who told San Antonio's Fox 29 the current blood shortage in San Antonio could pose a serious problem if the Zika infection hits the area. That scenario could shut down all area blood donations. She added that presently the center feels the effects of the reduced number of donors within an area that includes Laredo, Eagle Pass, and Del Rio.""People who have always donated blood we have to defer even if they only went to Mexico for a day,"" she added.  STBTC monitors blood donations for Zika virus. Vera worries the center could face empty or ""really sparse"" blood shelves over the summer months.She urged: ""Now more than ever, if you've ever considered donating, now is the time to do it."" She also told Fox 29: ""We don't know exactly what's going to happen with Zika transmission this summer. We do know that every summer we have a drop off in our blood supply, so that coupled with the threat of Zika and any other virus that comes our way-it's a really serious situation that we're facing.""The four known cases of the virus in San Antonio were acquired on travel outside the mainland in affected Zika infested regions, Mayor Taylor highlighted. Zika is the mosquito-borne virus now believed to cause the brain birth defect microcephaly in unborn babies and neurological disorders like Guillain-Barré syndrome, often a temporary paralysis.Also Monday, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick requested a state committee hearing on the Zika virus and what actions are being taken to control the potential spread of the virus be held in May. ""With increasing news concerning the Zika virus' potential impact on Texas, and after several personal discussions with medical experts over the past few months, I believe it is time for the latest update in a public hearing,"" said Patrick. on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16917","zika",856
"Liberal Democrats in the House rejected a bill that would end a redundant Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permit requirement to spray federally approved pesticides into bodies of water to combat the mosquito that carries the Zika virus.Rep. Bob Gibbs (R-OH) argued on the House floor in support of his Zika Vector Control Act (formerly the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act). He said the additional EPA permit requirement for pesticide spraying under the Clean Water Act is redundant since the pesticides are already approved under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).""Protecting communities from Zika and other mosquito borne diseases has become difficult thanks to a burdensome and duplicative federal regulation that requires more time and money spent on compliance rather than protecting the health and safety of the American people,"" Gibbs said, reports CNSNews.com.""Despite what the fear mongers suggest, all this expense comes with no additional environmental protection,"" he said, adding:House Democrats condemned the measure. The bill failed 262-159, with at least one member - Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) - comparing it to giving an allowance for the spraying of Agent Orange, an herbicide used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War.McDermott said:However, as Breitbart News reported, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) says that during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil successfully eliminated the mosquito carrying the Zika virus through the use of DDT.Dr. Anthony Fauci explained at a news conference that Brazil was able to stop the spread of Zika through ""a very aggressive attempt"" to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus.Fauci said:""The mosquito that is the predominant mosquito that spreads Zika is called Aedes aegypti,"" which ""is a very difficult mosquito to control and eliminate,"" he added. ""It will require a very aggressive, concerted effort.""Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told Breitbart News recently that, in fact, the government should wipe the virus out completely by lifting the ban on DDT.""DDT was the most effective public health weapon of all time,"" she explained, adding:""Substitute pesticides are far more toxic and expensive,"" Orient adds. ""People are advised to use insect repellents such as DEET - which is absorbed through the skin, and safety in pregnancy is not established.""Pioneer Energy president, Dr. Robert Zubrin, recently echoed the same idea at National Review: ""The most effective pesticide is DDT. If the Zika catastrophe is to be prevented in time, we need to use it.""He continued:Orient further wrote at Heartland Institute about the Zika ""scare"":While Orient says Zika - like German measles or rubella - can cause microcephaly, she asserts, ""MOST microcephaly is NOT caused by Zika. About 7 of 10,000 babies born in the U.S. have microcephaly - no thanks to Zika. Most (more than 90 percent) of the Brazilian babies recently confirmed to have microcephaly tested negative for Zika.""The CDC says the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus will move into much of the United States this summer. Currently, the agency says 157 pregnant women in the United States have tested positive for the Zika virus. The agency is recommending Americans ""use an outdoor flying insect spray where mosquitoes rest"" as a means to control the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus. Inside the home, CDC suggests keeping doors and windows closed and using an indoor flying insect fogger or spray such as those containing Tetramethrin or Imidacloprid.The urgency about the spread of the Zika virus among the Obama administration and its leftwing supporters has indeed been called into question, especially since abortion advocates have attached fears of the virus and its link, in some cases, to birth defects, to the need for more access to abortion in countries that have refused to legalize the procedure.The CDC has recently stated that the Zika virus ""can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, and infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect of the brain called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.""Planned Parenthood and its colleagues in the fetal tissue business have latched onto the message that Zika is an urgent crisis and have contrived a message to meet its own agenda.""Zika has made a long-standing public health crisis impossible to ignore and demonstrates the critical need of government support for sexual and reproductive health care,"" Chloe Cooney, director of global advocacy for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. ""The ability to decide if and when to have children is basic health care, but it's a basic human right as well, and yet it's not realized for so many women across the region, which this outbreak is making so crystal clear.""A special House panel investigating the fetal tissue practices of Planned Parenthood is also scrutinizing StemExpress, the primary biomedical company that has engaged with the abortion business in the transfer of the body parts of aborted babies. The Washington Post reports that StemExpress named Zika as one of the reasons it requires fetal tissue procurement.","breitbart","right","16941","zika",845
"When it first began at the end of December 2013 in a rural village in Guinea, the Ebola virus had been restricted to a few neighboring villages. By March 2014, it had spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone, and in the coming months it would spread to at least 8 other countries around the world. Yet, the World Health Organization (WHO) did not declare a Public Health Emergency (PHE) until August 2014. By September, global concern had risen to such a degree that travel restrictions from the three most severely impacted countries were imposed by dozens of countries.The WHO was widely, and justifiably, criticized for its failure to swiftly sound the alarm about the global spread of the Ebola virus. The Global Health Institute and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which analyzed the WHO's response to the Ebola epidemic, concluded that the WHO should be stripped of its role in declaring disease outbreaks to be an international emergency following its failure to warn the world of the dangers of Ebola in West Africa.  This raises disturbing questions more generally about the strength (and weakness) of the global health regime currently in place, and whether conflicts of interest and politicization of issues related to the issuance of declaring a health emergency are preventing a more robust response.The WHO, which includes virtually all countries in the world as members, is prevented from being nimble because of its size, as responsive as it might be by virtue of its multilateral decision-making protocol, and ultimately, more effective by virtue of the manner in which it operates. Sometimes what is needed is a firm hand to rise above the chatter of the  decision-making process - in other words, a strong leadership that will say, ""this is the right thing to do, and it is urgent"". Given the stakes at hand, one has to wonder how it can be allowed to have adopted such a 'reactive' approach to problem-solving, and how it can be perceived to be so behind the curve in tackling the increasing range of pandemics and other health-related issues that have become globalized by virtue of a combination of travel patterns, porous borders, and weak governance.The WHO has only issued public health emergencies four times since 2007 (when declaring such emergencies first became an established procedure, which is itself surprising): in 2009, for the influenza epidemic; in 2014, when it seems that polio had become resurgent; and again in August of that year for Ebola, and in 2016 for Zika. Since its founding in 1948 there have been numerous pandemics , and since 2000, at least three, but the WHO did not declare a PHE for HIV (which has killed more than 30 million people), SARS, MERS, and other viruses which have either seriously impacted individual countries, or more than one country. This is certainly true with the Zika virus. By the time the WHO had issued it PHE in February of 2016, the virus was already ""spreading explosively"", and had, by that time, already impacted 23 countries. First identified in Uganda in 1947, and having resided primarily in monkeys since that time, the Zika virus has grown exponentially among human populations since 1952 (also in Uganda).  In the case of Brazil, which is currently the epicenter of the virus, the virus is believed to have first appeared in 2013.  By May 2015, human cases had spiked dramatically throughout the Americas, and the WHO had estimated that up to four million people would be infected by the end of 2015. Yet, the WHO did not set up a global response unit until February 2016, and at that time, the emphasis was on whether Zika can cause microcephaly. It was only then that the WHO recommended 'emergency' status for the virus. Even then, the WHO did not recommend a plan of action to countries most impacted by Zika (the most obvious of which would have been a plan for mosquito control).The Rio Olympics has been hit by allegations of a conflict of interest over the dangers of the Zika virus to tens of thousands thousands of athletes and fans who will travel there in August. Some health experts have accused the WHO of brushing off the potential danger to public health - in Brazil and beyond -- and of being too close to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be adopting impartial and unbiased policy on this issue. The WHO said that postponing or moving the Olympics would not stop Zika from spreading, and that it would reach other continents regardless of where the Games are held. This is undoubtedly true - but it makes no sense for the world's premier global health organization to promote holding the games in the epicenter of the pandemic.An open letter signed by 150 international doctors and scientists criticized an apparent agreement between the WHO and the IOC, stating that the WHO entered into an official partnership with the IOC, in a Memorandum of Understanding that remains secret, casting doubt on the WHO's neutrality, and calling a failure to postpone or more the venue of the Games ""irresponsible"".  The irony is that the two organizations did indeed sign a very public MOU in 2010  which stated that both will work at the international and country level to promote activities and policy choices to help people reduce their risk of diseases.It is bad enough that some multilateral organizations have succumbed to bureaucratic inertia and harmful politicization, but when the organization charged with maintaining the world's health fails to live up to its organizational imperative and raison d'etre --  ""the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health"" -- it is dangerous. We are living in the era of man-made risk, where natural risks are increasingly colliding with risks of our own making. The Ebola and Zika pandemics are perfect examples of this. Given that these risks can only increase with time, it is high time that we get our houses of oversight in good order, so as to be in a favorable position to do battle going forward. The coming 'summer of Zika"" should serve as reminder to everyone that our margin for error is increasingly small.*Daniel Wagner is CEO of Country Risk Solutions and co-author of ""Global Risk Agility and Decision Making"".","huffingtonpost","left","16955","zika",1053
"Zika virus, which is spread by the aedes aegypti mosquito, is the suspected culprit behind a wave of birth defects in Brazil. The illness continues to spread across Central and South America and the Caribbean, and now cases are cropping up all over the world through people who traveled to affected regions. With the high volume of news about the Zika virus -- check out our full coverage here -- it's tough to stay up-to-date on the most recent developments. Here's the latest information you should know:While there's no official tally on U.S. cases of Zika, Minnesota, Texas, Hawaii, Florida and Illinois have all reported individuals who acquired the disease while traveling overseas. So far, there have not been any cases of Zika contracted on American or European soil.Meanwhile in Venezuela, medical professionals are up in arms because the government confirmed the presence of Zika in the country, but hasn't released statistics about how widespread the virus is there. Venezuela borders Brazil, where more than 4,000 babies have recently been born with microcephaly, a birth defect that's suspected to be linked to Zika.The Venezuelan Society of Public Health estimates that there could be 400,000 cases of Zika in the country based on fevers reported in the last six months, according to the Associated Press.Mexican officials say that the 18 cases of Zika in the country aren't enough of a reason for Mexican women to delay pregnancy, Reuters reports. This stands in contrast to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Jamaica, where health officials have have recommended that women delay pregnancy, if possible. Julius Lutwama, a virologist with the Uganda Virus Research Institute, told the Associated Press that there has never been a known outbreak of Zika in Uganda -- where the virus was discovered in monkeys in 1947 -- and that mosquito-transmitted malaria is a more pressing problem for Ugandans. The virus could naturally spread to the United States once the weather warms up, and Obama wants health officials to develop treatments and vaccines to fight Zika as soon as possible. This story was updated to include a confirmed case of Zika virus in a Minnesota traveler.","huffingtonpost","left","16827","zika",456
"Speaking at a rally in Birmingham, AL., on his quest to secure his party's nomination, GOP front-runner, Donald Trump, announced a broad and sweeping plan to stop the rapidly spreading Zika virus in its tracks.With 58 confirmed cases already reported in the New York area alone, Trump said, ""As soon as I become President, I will build a wall around the island of Manhattan and make the mosquitoes pay for it!""The crowd of about 8,000 Walmart workers, most of whom admitted to not knowing where New York was, erupted in cheers, anyway. When asked how he plans to get insects to come up with the tens of billions of dollars needed to construct the wall, Trump shouted, ""Are you a Jew? Get him out of here."" At which point, the reporter was summarily tackled and escorted out by plain clothes police. The crowd shouting, ""Jew! Jew! Jew!""Not letting him off the hook, another reporter picked up the baton and asked Mr. Trump how he plans to get the disease-spreading insects to pay for the wall? To which, Trump fired back, ""Are you accusing me of incest?! While, it's true, my daughter, Ivanka, is a beautiful woman, I would never dream of touching her p--sy. Again.""When it became obvious the media would not let him duck the question, Trump said, ""My proposal is to build the wall as a last resort. We will start by banning all mosquitoes from entering the U.S."" Trump said he doesn't mind alienating those mosquitoes who don't carry the Zika virus.""Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by mosquitoes that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,"" Trump said.""But, first, I would start by bombing the shit out of them. You can see they have blood coming out of them, wherever.""Trump said he plans to take his message directly to New Yorkers, with his next move being a rally at ""Columbia University School of Entenmannology.""When asked if he knew Entenmann's was a donut company, Trump replied, ""Whatever.

"There's no good excuse for Congress's disgraceful delay in responding to the dangerous Zika virus. But the worst excuse of all is that we can't afford to act. In fact, we can easily pay for a comprehensive response to this public health threat simply by closing a single corporate tax loophole.The House and Senate adjourned for its Memorial Day recess without providing the $1.9 billion President Obama urgently requested three months ago to fight Zika, which can cause crippling birth defects. The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently warned that there is only a ""narrow window of opportunity"" to effectively fight the disease. Hundreds of cases have already been reported in the continental United States.Each chamber of Congress has passed its own version of legislation--neither offering the full funding the Administration sought--but members left town without reconciling the two bills, ensuring more delay. One leading House Republican claimed the slow and incomplete Zika response was due at least in part to the GOP's desire to ""pay for it and not add to the national debt.""How ironic? Congress showed no such concern for fiscal prudence just six months ago, when it passed a $400 billion corporate tax cut without paying for any of it. Every dime went straight to the deficit. Apparently, deficits are no bar to ladling out tax breaks to corporations, but can block efforts to protect the physical health of the American people. Operating under this double standard, the House decided to fund the Zika emergency response at about one-third the level proposed by President Obama and to pay for it by draining funds intended to pay for an earlier but still potent Ebola threat. (In the face of Congressional foot-dragging, the Administration has already been forced to tap Ebola funds, but would replenish them in its Zika funding request. The House bill would not.)Instead of stealing from one vital medical effort to pay for another, we should raise the funds needed to effectively address all our public-health needs. One easy way to cover the cost of the Zika response is to close a corporate tax break that facilitates excessive CEO pay.   The stock options loophole lets corporations claim on their taxes a much higher expense for options (stock-based compensation mostly granted to top executives) than they really cost. Artificially inflating expenses cuts corporate tax bills. This blatant corporate giveaway costs us $25 billion in lost revenue over 10 years or around $2.5 billion a year, according to a Congressional estimate. That $2.5 billion would fully fund President Obama's Zika response plan, with plenty to spare.   And this is one of the smaller corporate tax loopholes. The biggest one allows American firms to indefinitely avoid paying almost $700 billion they owe in U.S. taxes on $2.4 trillion in offshore profits, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. Corporations dodge tens of billions of dollars in taxes a year through other loopholes as well.  Even though corporations and their army of lobbyists loudly complain about the official U.S. corporate tax rate of 35%, the real problem isn't that corporate rates are too high. It's that corporations aren't paying their fair share of taxes. Thanks to deductions, credits and other loopholes, few companies actually pay the official rate. A government study recently reported that large, profitable U.S. corporations paid an average federal tax rate of just 14% between 2008-12. Due in part to this low effective tax rate, the share of total federal revenue coming from corporations has shrunk over the past 65 years from one in three dollars to just one in ten. Meanwhile, urgent public needs go unmet. The nation's civil engineers give our infrastructure--highways, bridges, waterworks, transit--a dismal grade of D+, figuring we need to invest $3.6 trillion over the next four years to make them safe. Families in Flint, Michigan, still can't drink their tap water. And now we're nickel-and-diming our response to a major public health threat. The slow and stingy reaction to the Zika emergency by conservatives on Capitol Hill is just the most extreme example of skewed priorities favoring the wealthy and big corporations. Congress should be shielding the American people from public health threats, not shielding corporate tax loopholes from long-overdue reform.Please join Americans for Tax Fairness and our partners to call on Congress to fund an emergency response to Zika by ending corporate tax loopholes.","huffingtonpost","left","16966","zika",751

"From Newsweek and various sources:In an open letter to the director of the World Health Organization, 150 health professionals and academics called for a relocation or postponement of August's Olympic Games because of the Zika virus threat in Rio de Janeiro. The letter, published Friday, also accused the WHO of issuing guidance to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) under a conflict of interest.The letter calls for the WHO to issue new guidance to the IOC. ""It is...imperative that WHO conduct a fresh, evidence-based assessment of Zika and the Games, and its recommendations for travelers,""  the letter says. ""It is indisputable that...holding the Games as scheduled has a greater risk of accelerating the spread of the Brazilian viral strain.""The letter, addressed to WHO director Margaret Chan, can be viewed at RioOlympicslater.org, from which the graphic at the top of this Diary was obtained. It makes some sobering points:We make this call despite the widespread fatalism that the Rio 2016 Games are inevitable or ""too big to fail"".* * *The Brazilian strain of Zika virus harms health in ways that science has not observed before. An unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic. Should that happen to poor, as-yet unaffected places (e.g., most of South Asia and Africa) the suffering can be great. It is unethical to run the risk, just for Games that could proceed anyway, if postponed and/or moved.This is not the first public effort suggesting postponement of these Games. What makes this particular correspondence different is its unusually broad scope, representing medical professionals from far-reaching locations such as  Japan, Norway, the U.S., Lebanon, and South Africa. The letter's authors include physicians, lawyers, bioethicists, and public health officials.One of their arguments is that the World Health Organization has a conflict of interest on the issue because of its partnership with the International Olympic Committee, which the authors describe as pursuant to ""a Memorandum of Understanding, which remains secret."" Neither the IOC nor the World Health Organization have responded to this contention. A WHO spokesman has pointed to travel advisories it has issued to people and athletes attending the August games, warning pregnant women to stay away and advising men with pregnant sex partners to use condoms for the duration of the pregnancy.The authors say that such an advisory is outdated and insufficient, because Zika is now linked not only to fetal microcephaly for pregnant women, but also to Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults, and is  believed, according to several studies, to be neurotrophic, causing cellular death. Accordingly ""it is biologically plausible that there are other as yet undiscovered neurological injuries, as exist for similar viruses.""One of the letter's authors is Amir Attaran, a professor of law and medicine at the University of Ottawa and one of the letter's four authors.""It's not the number of visitors that matters, it's the places they're going to,"" Amir Attaran, a professor of law and medicine at the University of Ottawa and one of the letter's four authors, tells  Newsweek. ""You're getting all sorts of travel to places that basically don't have travel links with Rio right now-Ethiopia, Kenya, Sri Lanka.""Responding to people who say Zika will spread regardless of whether the Olympics take place in Rio, Attaran says, ""That is not a rationale for increasing and furthering the spread through the Olympics. By that rationale, you'd argue that if a forest fire is under way, what's the big deal with throwing some gasoline on it?""I love the Olympics as much as anyone but I'm cynical enough to realize that Billions of corporate dollars are on the line here (as well as the hopes and dreams of a few thousand athletes). It will take far more than an open letter from a hundred doctors to move something this mammoth off schedule. But it will be interesting to see how the World Health Organization reacts as August approaches and the sense of urgency mounts.  The attempts in Rio to contain the virus through its mosquito-killing program have failed, and the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses has actually increased in the first five months of this year (using Dengue as a proxy indicator). As the letter points out,  the real cause of the spread of disease is poverty:Rio's health system is so severely weakened as to make a last-minute push against Zika impossible. Recently Rio's state government declared a health sector emergency...and Rio's city government cut funding against mosquito-borne disease by 20%.14 While the virus is the infectious agent of Zika, its real cause is Rio's poor social conditions and sanitation-factors that lack a quick fix, and that are not helped when shrinking health resources are diverted to the Games.","dailykos","left","16948","zika",813
"On Monday, California health officials admitted that six people in California who contracted the disease abroad have been diagnosed with the Zika virus since 2013.California Department of Public Health Director Karen Smith said that no evidence has been found that the Asian tiger and the yellow fever mosquitoes that carry the disease exist in California, but warned, ""Although no one has contracted Zika virus in California, mosquito bites can still be harmful and the public should take steps to protect themselves,"" according to the Los Angeles Times.No vaccine exists for Zika, which has been linked to microcephaly, a disease in which babies are born with underdeveloped brains. On Monday, the World health organization declared a global emergency, as 4,000 cases of microcephaly have been reported in Brazil since October. WHO director general Margaret Chan stated, ""I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities reported in Latin America following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014 constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.""Two Californians contracted Zika while abroad in 2015; three more cases derived from 2014 and one in 2013, according to state officials. At least one case involved a young girl in Los Angeles County, according to county officials.Zika has been reported in over 20 countries in the Americas.Zika can only be transmitted if a mosquito bites a person who has the virus, then bites another person. The risk of microcephaly has catalyzed authorities to inform women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant not to visit countries where the virus is present.12 of the 58 counties in California have found the mosquitos responsible for Zika in their areas, according to the California Department of Public Health.","breitbart","right","16833","zika",283
"Every few years it seems a new virus captures the public's attention. Over a decade ago it was SARS which had people in Hong Kong wearing masks, then it was avian flu, then H1N1, then the West Nile virus, and then Ebola and now, it is Zika.We don't know for certain why a new virus emerges, but I can speculate. More on this later but first let me share what we know about the Zika virus.Over a half century ago, Zika virus  was discovered in Africa (I found it mentioned only in a chart in my Tropical Medicine textbook).  Now the virus has hopped across the oceans into the Americas. In Brazil alone, where the virus was discovered in May, a million Zika infections have occurred and the number may reach up to 4 million over the next year.Understanding the chain of transmission is critical to controlling and preventing Zika infections. Transmission flows back and forth between mosquitoes and people.  First, an infected mosquito bites a person, who becomes infected.  The infection is spread when an uninfected mosquito bites that same person.  That mosquito in turn becomes a carrier that goes on to spread the virus to other people.  This is the same way malaria and other viruses, like dengue fever, cause infections in the tropics. Another route of transmission for the Zika virus that has been discovered is sexual contact. Recently in Texas, a traveler who had recently traveled to Venezuela infected his or her sexual partner, who had not left the country. Studies show that Zika can also be transmitted by blood transfusion. At present no Zika-infected mosquitoes have been found in the United States, and no non-travelers have reported infections, other than the Texas case. But it is only a matter of time until such cases will appear.  Why do experts say this? Because the two types of mosquitoes which spread the Zika virus are present in the southeast United States from Florida across to Texas and up to  Tennessee, Ohio and Connecticut. For decades the Zika virus has not been widely investigated or feared because it was known to cause only a mild infection with fever, rash, arthritis and red-eyes, which subsided within a week.  However, last year health authorities in Brazil noticed a surge in cases of birth defects among newborns linked with infection of Zika virus. To date a cause-and-effect relationship between the virus and the birth defect of microcephaly (small head) has not been proven. Also it is unclear if the virus has changed or if better monitoring in the Americas has led to its connection with birth defects. Zika has no treatment and no vaccine, and none are available in the short term. Many are wondering if they should put their vacation plans, including going to the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, on hold. In time it is likely the outbreak will be contained but for now, health agencies are recommending that pregnant women not travel to Zika-affected areas which includes Brazil and many other South American countries, all of Central America, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the US virgin islands. For people living in these regions, local governments are recommending that women delay pregnancy.  Some authorities advise women who are traveling to these areas to wait for one month after their return before getting pregnant. Those who must travel should use extra precautions to not become bitten by mosquitoes.  So, now to answer the question, why do more new viruses appear to be emerging? I believe there are three reasons: globalization, surveillance, and climate change. We need to only look at the flight destinations page in back of the airline magazine. In a single day millions of people connect to thousands of flights to hundreds of destinations. This is how quickly a virus such as avian flu can spread.Secondly,  we may be becoming more aware of virus outbreaks due to better global surveillance of diseases by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly every country has collaborations  and disease surveillance posts for early detection. Lastly,  our environment is changing: global warming, deforestation, changing weather patterns and coastlines  affect not only  human patterns and habitat but also that of animals, primates, mosquitoes, birds - and even viruses who reside within them. So, yet again,  as a new virus emerges we need to be concerned but not panic. We need to use our knowledge to help overcome our fears.","huffingtonpost","left","16846","zika",770
"Yale University School of Public Health Professor Albert Ko claims the cases of microcephaly in Brazil are just the start of concerns about birth defects linked to the Zika virus.""It seems like microcephaly may just be the tip of the iceberg,"" he stressed, adding:Ko spent the month of December at three maternity hospitals in Salvador, Brazil, examining babies with and without microcephaly. Experts are working to understand a possible link between the Zika virus and the birth defect, which occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth and causes a small head. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the Zika outbreak, however, Brazil has documented over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.Microcephaly has received the most attention, but Ko found other problems with the infants.""We're seeing a spectrum. Many have fairly severe central nervous system lesions,"" he explained. ""There are also a lot of calcium deposits.  Those can cause seizures and cause impairment in terms of function for the brain.""He added, ""We're also seeing that in some babies, the brains, which usually have wrinkles, are actually smooth. That's a sign that development of the brain has been impaired. Several of them are also impaired with respect to vision and hearing.""Ko also said the scientists believe Zika caused the microcephaly cases, but they need to rule out other possible causes.""We have identified both stillbirths and live births,"" he said. ""We have identified 100 live births. But not all of those [cases] may be caused by Zika. We are trying to rule out other common causes, such as prematurity and congenital infections, including toxoplasmosis.""The CDC listed rubella, cytomegalovirus, severe malnutrition, alcohol, drugs, and toxic chemicals as other causes of microcephaly.Scientists in Brazil are tracking a series of cases of eye damage in babies with microcephaly. Vision problems are often a consequence of the developmental disorder.The journal JAMA Opthalmology reported on a study that took place in December 2015 at Roberto Santos General Hospital in Salvador, Brazil. Doctors examined 29 babies, all with microcephaly, focusing on the 58 eyes.They found ""ocular abnormalities in 17 eyes (29.3%) of 10 children (34.5%)."" The doctors wrote:""It is very difficult to measure visual function in a newborn baby,"" said Dr. Lee Jampol, an ophthalmology professor. ""We are concerned that these lesions are going to have an effect on vision as the babies get older. There is a lot of testing that [has] not been done yet.""Fear of microcephaly or other complications due to Zika have pushed women to illegal abortions in Brazil. Doctors indicate women in all social classes are seeking out these abortions ""in despair over the possibility of deformity."" Some even go through with abortions without concrete proof of complications. Doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester or after birth.In Colombia, doctors have diagnosed 3,100 pregnant women with Zika, but none of the babies have microcephaly.","breitbart","right","16841","zika",515
"Possibly the world's hardest creature to love.Summer is approaching, and with it comes waves of mosquitoes. The high-pitched whine of these little vampires is often regarded as little more than a buzzing, itch-inducing annoyance in the United States, but around the world there are more than two dozen species of mosquito that pause to sip human blood and they carry a staggering array of diseases. The bone-deep pain of dengue fever. The brain-baking fevers of encephalitis. Half a million deaths each year from malaria. All these come courtesy of mosquitoes.In the United States, the incidence of mosquito-borne disease is not just lower than in tropical areas, it's much lower than it was here a century ago. Some of this is due to mosquito control programs that flooded areas with pesticides-and incidentally screwed up the ecosystem-but more of the reduction is simply because over the years we've drained, filled, and paved over much of our wetlands. Which, yeah, screwed up a big chunk of the ecosystem.But anyway, we're not used to thinking of mosquitoes as something that's not just irritating, but actively dangerous despite ongoing problems with diseases such as St. Louis Encephalitis, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, and West Nile Disease. And now, there's the potential for something new. This year, the Zika virus may enter the United States.The Zika virus has exploded throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. While adults typically suffer mild, if any, symptoms, there's an increasingly strong link between infections in pregnant women and fetal death and devastating birth defects - babies born with small heads that signal a damaged brain.

""We know very little and we aren't as worried as we should be.""The Chicago Bulls big told the Associated Press that he may skip the games due to Zika but remains undecided. Golfers Marc Leishman and Vijay Singh cited Zika in opting to stay home. But the winnings in Rio look slim by PGA standards, so financial considerations may play a role as well. Gasol, a six-time NBA All-Star, two-time NBA champion, and past NBA Rookie of the Year, would become the first medalist and household name-at least in households that watch ESPN instead of CNN-to boycott the games specifically over Zika concerns.Gasol writes:Though major stars such as American soccer players Alex Morgan and Hope Solo express similar concerns, no major athlete expected in Rio has changed summer plans thus far. More than 100 health experts signed a letter last week demanding that the International Olympic Committee change its plans over holding the games in Brazil this summer.Gasol wonders, ""[A]re we taking the precautions that will guarantee the health and safety of fans, athletes and other professionals who will travel to Rio, or are we putting financial concerns above the health of millions of people around the world?""","breitbart","right","16951","zika",257
"The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and sometimes brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean, and with the high volume of news about the virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.Here are five updates, opinions and developments to know about now:  U.S. pharmaceutical company Inovio is developing a Zika virus vaccine that appears to work in mice. The synthetic vaccine produced ""robust and durable immune responses"" in pre-clinical trials, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Inovio will now test the vaccine in non-human primates, and are making preparations for trials in human beings by the end of 2016.The company is one of at least 15 firms or academic groups trying to develop a vaccine for Zika virus, reports Reuters. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the federal National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said in past press conferences that he expects his agency's version of a Zika virus vaccine to start human trials by summer of 2016. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants to put a stop to collecting blood in areas where there is active Zika virus transmission. In the U.S., those are the territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands, reports Reuters. The recommended ban could also extend to a few southeastern U.S. states if they also experience small disease outbreaks as expected. Clinics will be able to continue collecting platelets and plasma in areas with active Zika virus transmission only if they use an FDA-approved pathogen-reduction device to lower the risk of passing the virus to recipients.The FDA also recommended that people traveling from an area with active Zika virus transmission refrain from donating blood for at least four weeks, along with anyone who may have experienced symptoms or had sex with a person who may have been exposed to Zika virus. Currently, there are no reports that Zika virus has entered the U.S. blood supply.About $25 million will come directly from the WHO, but the global health body says that it expects other countries and donors to contribute as well. The WHO has already deployed about $2 million in emergency funds to get work going, reports Reuters.  Global health experts criticized the move, saying that WHO doesn't appear to have learned lessons from the Ebola crisis.""That lesson is that mobilizing funding in the midst of a global emergency will always be too little, too late,"" said public health professor Lawrence Gostin of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. WHO declared the microcephaly potentially linked to Zika virus to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Feb. 1.As microcephaly cases in Brazil continue to rise, rumors and conspiracy theories about what causes the birth defect are spreading, too, according to the New York Times. Scientists, governments and health organizations all strongly suspect that there's a connection between Zika virus and microcephaly, and are working to prove that connection now. Conspiracy websites and at least one Hollywood actor, however, claim that there might be something more sinister behind the birth defect's increased prevalence.A report by Argentinian doctors that claimed a Monsanto-produced larvicide in Brazil's drinking water was the true cause of the country's microcephaly surge was roundly debunked by HuffPost and other publications this this week, but other far-fetched theories are still being passed around. They include myriad combinations of the following: a British biotech company released genetically modified mosquitos that cause microcephaly, microcephaly is part of a plot to depopulate the Earth and create a ""one-world"" government, expired vaccines cause microcephaly, chicken pox and rubella vaccines cause microcephaly, and Zika is a ruse to distract Brazilian citizens from a cancer cure that the government is keeping secret.In a country where many citizens already mistrust the government, rapidly spreading misinformation, such as the debunked larvicide report, is especially problematic. ""The effect of this [report] to cause panic in people, and to prevent an effective response to disease carrying-vectors, is a very substantial negative,"" Ian Musgrave, an expert on neurotoxicology and pharmacology at the University of Adelaide previous told HuffPost. ""If they wanted to control the mosquitos, what are they going to use now? Something even more toxic?"" A new report on a United Kingdom resident who contracted Zika virus after traveling to the Pacific Islands in 2014 found that the virus stayed in the man's semen for almost nine weeks after he became ill, Live Science reported.""Our data may indicate prolonged presence of [Zika] virus in semen, which, in turn, could indicate a prolonged potential for sexual transmission,"" researchers from Public Health England wrote in the report, to be published in May in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.The countries and territories under travel alert by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are: American Samoa, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Samoa, Suriname, Tonga, Venezuela and the U.S. Virgin Islands. ","huffingtonpost","left","16848","zika",1047
"This week, while research groups formed coalitions to develop a Zika virus vaccine, scientists learned more about the disease after an autopsy report showed Zika virus in brain tissue of an aborted fetus. The fetus's mother had contracted Zika virus in Brazil during her first trimester. The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   With the high volume of news about the Zika virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.The University of Texas Medical Branch and the government of Brazil signed a deal to collaborate on a Zika virus vaccine, with a goal to start clinical testing within a year, The Associated Press reports. The new partnership is one of several alliances that Brazil's ministry of health has forged in response to the country's Zika outbreak, including a collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical company that helped developed an Ebola vaccine following the 2014-2015 outbreak of the disease in West Africa.In a statement following the announcement, Brazil's health minister, Marcelo Castro, outlined a three-pronged approach to addressing the virus: Mosquito control, patient treatment and research and development. ""We have no doubt that Zika virus causes microcephaly, but there are other hypotheses that could be proven in the future, other factors that also influence it,"" Castro said, according to HuffPost Brazil.While the link between Zika virus and the birth defect microcephaly is still unproven, a new study provides some clues to understanding the virus, The Associated Press reports. An autopsy a fetus aborted from a woman who contracted Zika virus in Brazil during her first trimester revealed that the fetus's brain was only a fraction of the size that would be expected at that stage of development. Scientists found Zika virus in the fetus's brain tissue, but not in any other organs. Scientists sequenced the virus's genetic material for future research that investigates the probable link between the virus and microcephaly.New details are emerging about the infants born with microcephaly. According to a very small study, published in JAMA Ophthalmology, a third of the study subjects, all of whom had microcephaly, were also born with eye damage, including lesions or scars in the retina and optic nerve. It's unknown if the eye damage is unique to microcephaly or if it occurs in the general population.  Three people with Zika virus infections died in Brazil last year, confirmed the country's health ministry, but Reuters reports it's unclear if the disease was the sole cause of death. One was a 20-year-old woman who died of respiratory problems that were likely linked to the virus, said Brazil's health minister.The virus is typically mild for most people who get it. The 20 percent of infected people who do experience symptoms only have fever, mild rash, red eyes and joint pain for up to a week. The virus is not considered lethal. Zika virus was discovered in Uganda in 1947, but it hasn't erupted in an epidemic with possible birth defects in African countries the way that it has in Latin America. But now, in 2016, experts are worried that the virus may return to the African mainland in mutated form, potentially triggering a new wave of infections among a population that had previously been immune to the disease, reports Reuters. Right now, the island nation of Cape Verde is the only country in Africa with ongoing Zika virus transmission. But frequent flights connecting these islands to cities on the African mainland has health officials worried that the virus will soon migrate, notes Reuters. Africa has more than 20 different kinds of mosquitos that can carry Zika virus, although its unclear whether they can transmit the disease to people with the same ease as the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization both advise people who were potentially exposed to Zika virus to use condoms to protect against sexual transmission -- especially if their partner is pregnant. That may be a problem for Zika virus-affected Latin America, home to about 40 percent of the world's Roman Catholics. The religion expressly forbids the use of any contraception during sex, except to reduce the risk of AIDS -- an amendment former Pope Benedict wrote about in 2010. Now, the advocacy group Catholics for Choice is asking current Pope Francis to make it clear that reducing risk of Zika virus should also be another exception to the condom rule, reports Reuters. The pope is set to travel to Cuba and Mexico Friday, and for Catholics for Choice, the trip is an opportunity for him to show he truly stands ""in solidarity with the poor"" about Zika virus, both about the use of condoms and a woman's decision to have an abortion.Still have questions?

"As a disease, Zika virus caught the world's doctors and scientists off-guard. It appears to cause severe harm in a variety of different ways, including birth defects and neurological disorders, yet the symptoms are mild or negligible for most people who contract it. It can be passed both from mother to fetus and through sex -- a first in the realm of mosquito-borne diseases. Finally, despite the fact that Zika virus has been around since 1947, it has only inflicted widespread injury in the current 2015-2016 outbreak, centered mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean.  That final aspect of Zika virus is what's most intriguing to scientists like Stephanie Valderramos, co-author of a new study on the way Zika virus has mutated over time and across different host species.Valderramos and her colleagues have found that the virus is extremely good at mutating, and the way the disease has changed over the decades may help explain how it's been able to seriously hurt some people who get it. This research, published in the journal Cell Host and Microbe, may also play a preliminary role in broadening our understanding of how the virus is transmitted. According to Valderramos, mosquitoes may not even be the primary mode of Zika virus transmission in this current outbreak.""The fundamental question I think everyone wants to know is, how has this virus that has been around for almost 70 years not really caused such clinical problems until the past two years?"" said Valderramos, a clinical research fellow in obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA. In the hope of further understanding Zika's spread, Valderramos and her team traced the virus' genetic makeup over several decades, countries and organisms, using samples from both humans and mosquitoes. They hope to one day determine if a constellation of diseases and syndromes, from the birth defect microcephaly to the autoimmune disorders Guillain-Barré Syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, can be attributed to genetic mutations in the virus itself. The mutations could also one day clue scientists in on how the virus has managed to spread so fast within the past two years, after only sporadically popping up in handfuls of people since its discovery in 1947. The team, made up of researchers from both UCLA and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, analyzed 41 different strains of Zika in samples drawn from people, mosquitoes and monkeys.Most significantly, they found that there were substantial genetic differences in the viruses taken from human and mosquito blood samples. The Zika virus isolated from mosquitoes has different genetic sequencing than any strain isolated from human beings.The research team did not investigate why this might be. Valderramos says the explanation could be purely methodological; her team, and scientists before her, have not sampled enough mosquitoes to have a comprehensive picture of all the possible Zika virus strains in the world. Sampling could also be biased; Zika was previously primarily thought of as a mosquito-borne virus with little clinical consequence for people, so scientists had not been sampling the insects with an eye toward matching them up with human strains. Another possibility could be that the virus has mutated to the point where mosquitoes may play a smaller role -- and sexual transmission plays a bigger one -- than previously thought. Indeed, the study notes that other researchers were unable to detect Zika virus in any mosquitoes during a 2007 outbreak in Micronesia, despite widespread ""active surveillance.""While Valderramos concedes that mosquitos are ""probably"" the main mode of transmission, as most scientists around the world agree, the mismatch in virus strains between mosquitoes and humans hints at a remote possibility that other modes of transmission may be more dominant in this current outbreak. ""It raises the questions of whether or not mosquitos are necessarily the primary mode of transmission,"" said Valderramos. ""Since it's now shown to be transmitted other ways, we scientifically need to broaden our thinking and not make assumptions about that.""Other findings include the fact that current Zika strains found in humans are more genetically similar to a 1966 Malaysian strain compared to a 1968 Nigerian strain. This could mean that recent outbreaks are descended from an ""Asian lineage"" of the virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded last week that the totality of evidence indicates that Zika virus can cause microcephaly and other severe birth defects in babies whose mothers contract the disease during pregnancy. The CDC's new scientific clarity allows health officials to be more direct about communicating with the public about the risk of Zika virus as mosquito season approaches in the U.S., but analyses like Valderramos', as well as the growing evidence that Zika virus can be easily spread through both vaginal and anal intercourse, suggests that public health warnings are going to have to cover a lot more than just mosquito bite prevention. ""Zika virus has definitely changed the paradigm of how we think about... viruses that are transmitted by mosquitos,"" Valderramos concluded. ""There's other viruses that are transmitted sexually and there's other viruses that are transmitted from mother to fetus. But this is the first [mosquito-borne] virus that has been able to be transmitted in so many different ways.""There are currently 358 cases of travel-linked Zika virus in the U.S., and seven of the cases were sexually transmitted. ","huffingtonpost","left","16910","zika",910
"BOGOTA (Reuters) - The mosquito-borne Zika virus has already infected more than 13,500 people in Colombia and could hit as many as 700,000, the health minister said on Wednesday.According to Pan-American Health Organization figures, the country is second only to Brazil in infection rates, health minister Alejandro Gaviria told journalists.""We expect an expansion similar to what we had with the chikungunya virus last year, to finish with between 600,000 to 700,000 cases,"" Gaviria said.Some 560 pregnant women are among those infected, the minister said, though so far no cases of newborns suffering from microcephaly, a congenital defect caused by zika, have been registered in the country.The government is advising Colombian women to delay becoming pregnant for six to eight months in a bid to avoid potential infection.The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention last week warned pregnant women to avoid travel to 14 countries, including Colombia, and territories in the Caribbean and Latin America affected by the virus.(Reporting by Luis Jaime Acosta, writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; editing by Helen Murphy and David Gregorio) ","huffingtonpost","left","16821","zika",203
"The mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to brain damage in thousands of babies in Brazil, is likely to spread to all countries in the Americas except for Canada and Chile, the World Health Organization said on Monday.Zika transmission has not yet been reported in the continental United States, although a woman who fell ill with the virus in Brazil later gave birth to a brain-damaged baby in Hawaii.Brazil's Health Ministry said in November that Zika was linked to a fetal deformation known as microcephaly, in which infants are born with smaller-than-usual brains.Brazil has reported 3,893 suspected cases of microcephaly, the WHO said last Friday, over 30 times more than in any year since 2010 and equivalent to 1-2 percent of all newborns in the state of Pernambuco, one of the worst-hit areas.The Zika outbreak comes hard on the heels of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, demonstrating once again how little-understood diseases can rapidly emerge as global threats.""We've got no drugs and we've got no vaccines. It's a case of deja vu because that's exactly what we were saying with Ebola,"" said Trudie Lang, a professor of global health at the University of Oxford. ""It's really important to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible.""Large drugmakers' investment in tropical disease vaccines with uncertain commercial prospects has so far been patchy, prompting health experts to call for a new system of incentives following the Ebola experience.""We need to have some kind of a plan that makes (companies) feel there is a sustainable solution and not just a one-shot deal over and over again,"" Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, said last week.The Sao Paulo-based Butantan Institute is currently leading the research charge on Zika and said last week it planned to develop a vaccine ""in record time"", although its director warned this was still likely to take three to five years.British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline said on Monday it was studying the feasibility of using its vaccine technology on Zika, while France's Sanofi said it was reviewing possibilities.The virus was first found in a monkey in the Zika forest near Lake Victoria, Uganda, in 1947, and has historically occurred in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. But there is little scientific data on it and it is unclear why it might be causing microcephaly in Brazil.Laura Rodrigues of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said it was possible the disease could be evolving.If the epidemic was still going on in August, when Brazil is due to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, then pregnant women should either stay away or be obsessive about covering up against mosquito bites, she said.The WHO advised pregnant women planning to travel to areas where Zika is circulating to consult a healthcare provider before traveling and on return.The clinical symptoms of Zika are usually mild and often similar to dengue, a fever which is transmitted by the same Aedes aegypti mosquito, leading to fears that Zika will spread into all parts of the world where dengue is commonplace.More than one-third of the world's population lives in areas at risk of dengue infection, in a band stretching through Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Latin America.Zika's rapid spread, to 21 countries and territories in the Americas since May 2015, is due to the prevalence of Aedes aegypti and a lack of immunity among the population, the WHO said in a statement.Like rubella, which also causes mild symptoms but can lead to birth defects, health experts believe a vaccine is needed to protect girls before they reach child-bearing age.Evidence about other transmission routes, apart from mosquito bites, is limited.""Zika has been isolated in human semen, and one case of possible person-to-person sexual transmission has been described. However, more evidence is needed to confirm whether sexual contact is a means of Zika transmission,"" the WHO said.While a causal link between Zika and microcephaly has not yet been definitively proven, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said the circumstantial evidence was ""suggestive and extremely worrisome"".In addition to finding a vaccine and potential drugs to fight Zika, some scientists are also planning to take the fight to the mosquitoes that carry the disease.Oxitec, the UK subsidiary of U.S. synthetic biology company Intrexon, hopes to deploy a self-limiting genetically modified strain of insects to compete with normal Aedes aegypti.Oxitec says its proprietary OX513A mosquito succeeded in reducing wild larvae of the Aedes mosquito by 82 percent in an area of Brazil where 25 million of the transgenic insects were released between April and November. Authorities reported a big drop in dengue cases in the area. ","huffingtonpost","left","16825","zika",829
"Local mosquito control departments in the Gulf Coast will be the front lines of the fight against the Zika virus in the United States, reports Wired magazine.Some of the poorest U.S. neighborhoods are reportedly at the highest risk for being afflicted by the mosquito-borne Zika virus.Wired quotes Peter Hotez, chief of the Baylor College of Medicine National School of Tropical Medicine, as saying, ""The Gulf Coast is vulnerable because we have both mosquito vectors and poverty. Poverty is an important risk factor because people live in poor quality housing with broken screens, poor garbage collection.""East Houston, where half the population lives in poverty, is of the most concern, reports Wired. Mosquito control programs in the U.S. are often ineffective and underfunded, warns the magazine.""In the U.S., our vector control programs are not very effective,"" Robert Tesh, a mosquito-borne disease expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who has collaborated with the Harris County mosquito control, told Wired.""Where Have All the Vector Control Programs Gone?"" reportedly lamented an environmental health scientist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2010, noting widespread budget cuts to local programs.CDC reports that there are no locally transmitted cases reported in the continental United States, adding that cases have been detected among returning travelers.Moreover, local transmissions have been reported in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa - all U.S. territories.CDC predicts that the Zika cases among travelers visiting or returning to the U.S. will likely increase given the recent outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean, noting that the imported cases could fuel the local spread of the virus in some areas in the United States.Some regions are already preparing to fight Zika in the United States.""Every summer, millions of mosquitos hatch along the Gulf Coast and set out on a quest for blood. It's only February, but people are already worrying about mosquito season thanks to Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that may cause debilitating brain defects in babies and is currently racing through Latin America,"" notes Wired. ""The Gulf Coast is almost certainly next.""""When the mosquito hordes do descend this summer, the front lines of the fight against Zika will not be in some high-tech lab, but in local mosquito control departments,"" it adds. ""A vaccine or cure for Zika is years away, so controlling Zika means controlling the vector that spreads the virus from person to person: the Aedes aegypti mosquito, whose range in the US follows the Gulf Coast.""The mosquito control program in Harris County, Texas, is one of the more robust in the United States, given that the county is the third most populous in the country.Moreover, the presence of the virus-carrying mosquito - which is also responsible for bringing dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya to the United States - is common in Harris County.County residents also tend to travel to Latin America, home to the Zika outbreak. CDC estimates that there are 30 countries and territories worldwide with active Zika virus transmission, most of which (26) are in Latin America and the Caribbean.""It's a matter of when, not if,"" said Umair Shah, executive director of Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services, referring to Zika reaching the continental U.S.Wired learned from Mustapha Debboun, the head of mosquito control in Harris County that the African vector ""likes to fly low, biting ankles and feet-too low to spray with pesticides from helicopters or trucks  [and] they like to live indoors in dark, cool spaces like under the bed.""""The most effective way to control A. aegypti is to get rid of the small-even tiny-bodies of water where they breed,"" notes Wired.","breitbart","right","16840","zika",630
"Brazil confirms this week it has documented a staggering 91,387 cases of Zika in 2016, with more than 7,000 cases being pregnant women. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns the number of Zika cases globally is set to increase, though cooling temperatures may finally lower the rates of infection in Brazil itself.The Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo has published the new government statistics, which nearly guarantee that more than 100,000 Zika cases will be recorded this year, though Brazil is nearing the Southern Hemisphere's autumn. It notes that health experts nationwide are alarmed not just by the rates of Zika contraction, but by the ""triple epidemic"" of related diseases chikungunya and dengue, both spread by the aedes aegypti mosquito. In addition to these three diseases, the mosquito is also capable of spreading yellow fever.The Folha notes that the host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Rio de Janeiro, leads the number of documented Zika cases with 25,930 so far. As Zika is known to spread in two ways - through mosquito bites and by sexual transmission - tourists planning to travel to Rio for the Olympic Games are being warned to wear long-sleeved clothes and engage only in protected sex to avoid Zika.WHO announced Monday that it expects the number of Zika cases to decline in Brazil, but is preparing for a ""marked increase"" in Zika cases in the Northern Hemisphere as temperatures warm. The only nations in the Western Hemisphere not to boast a significant population of the relevant mosquito species are Chile and Canada, though both have documented Zika cases within their borders in individuals who traveled abroad.WHO's assistant director general, Marie-Paule Kieny, told reporters that Zika in Brazil was ""clearly on the decline,"" though she did not provide numerical evidence for this. She warned that the virus remains a ""global emergency.""A study published recently estimates that up to two billion people worldwide are at risk for contracting Zika.Brazil is hoping that the cooling weather will help boost ticket sales for the Olympics. As early as February, airlines and travel groups began offering free cancelations to trips to affected regions - Brazil, as well as Colombia - for pregnant women, or women who fear they could become pregnant. Some fear that new studies are approaching tangible conclusions regarding new ways for Zika to enter the human bloodstream; for example, a recent study found certain Brazilian primates carrying Zika in their blood, a sign that a human being may be able to contract Zika from another primate species.Pregnant women are, by far, the most at risk for serious consequences stemming from contracting Zika. An estimated 80 percent of Zika carriers show no symptoms and may not know they have the disease. Those who do, exhibit mild symptoms of infection, such as conjunctivitis and low-grade fever.In pregnant women, however, the virus appears to immediately attack the fetus, etching away at brain development. Babies born to mothers carrying Zika are often diagnosed with microcephaly, a condition in which the baby's skull is too small for its brain, crushing the brain and causing severe damage.Doctors are beginning to see even more advanced deterioration in new cases of Zika infants, however. The Wall Street Journal reports that doctors have found not only a small head, but undeveloped brains carrying water where vital brain structures that control vision and basic thought should be.""These aren't just microcephaly, like a slightly small head. The brain structure is very abnormal,"" Jeanne Sheffield, director of maternal-fetal medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, told the newspaper.Brazil is facing not only the challenge of convincing women to travel to the Olympics despite this threat, but convincing potential tourists to overlook the large-scale political upheaval in the country. Growing political discord within Brazil has led many to reconsider traveling there, as the virus remains a threat in a government in revolt, distracted by too many other developing crises to give Zika the necessary attention.Emblematic of this is the recent resignation of Marcelo Castro, the nation's minister of health. Castro will step down on Wednesday, after having received criticism for warning in January that the Zika outbreak was ""more serious than we can imagine"" and that the Brazilian government was unprepared for such a development.Castro is not stepping down as a result of any of his actions in office, however; he is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), formerly part of a unity government with President Dilma Rousseff. In March, the party voted to break away from the ruling Workers' Party coalition, allowing legislators to vote for Rousseff's impeachment. The departure forced all PMDB office-holders in Rousseff's employ, except Vice President Michel Temer, to step down or resign from the party.","breitbart","right","16920","zika",794
"Brazil has recently ramped up its fight against the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which spreads dengue, Chikungunya and Zika, the latter a virus that has been linked to birth defects. Brazil's health minister Marcelo Castro announced in January that the country would send 200,000 members of the armed forces to help in mosquito eradication, and cities across the country have intensified strategies to combat the pest.But a few communities in Brazil are already leading the way when it comes to eliminating the disease-carrying mosquito from their neighborhoods. One of these is the small town of Água Branca, home to 16,000 people in the state of Piauí. Compared to other similarly sized rural towns in Brazil, Água Branca should have a mosquito problem. But in 2013, when Zika virus wasn't even an issue, the town launched a community initiative to address rising dengue fever rates. The partnership between municipal health authorities and residents focused on eliminating mosquito hotspots, and as a result, Água Branca has reportedly been mosquito-free for three years.Now the state's governor is taking the program to other towns, where officials hope to replicate Água Branca's success.Health officials place green stickers on houses deemed free of mosquito larvae; yellow stickers on houses that have no larvae but have cases of water accumulation; and red stickers on houses with larvae. The stickers, which are visible to anyone who passes by, either serve as public incentives for residents to continue setting an example for others, or motivate struggling households to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds on their property.When the community initiative began, health officials conducted awareness campaigns to explain how the sticker system would work, Dóris Leal, Água Branca's health surveillance coordinator, explained to HuffPost Brazil.Leal credits the partnership between endemic disease control officers and health workers at the Family Health Unit for successfully motivating town residents and making them part of the strategy to protect their own health.""Our objective, beyond combating mosquito hotspots in the city, was to engage and empower residents so that they could be the agents of change in this process,"" Leal said. ""With the two teams working together, we have a greater capacity to motivate the work and the people.""Endemic disease control officers, along with doctors from local Family Health units (Brazil's community-based approach to primary care), traveled to neighborhoods and rural areas in Água Branca, visiting households and going through mosquito control checklists with residents.These professionals pointed out sites where water could accumulate and explained the procedures necessary for combating mosquitoes. At the end of the visit, each household received a sticker based on the level of mosquito eradication it had done (or still needed to do) on the property.The assignment of colored stickers proved a source of inspiration for residents, as well as a factor that motivated change. Those who received green stickers set an example for the rest of the community, and those with a red stamp were motivated to make the extra effort to raise mosquito safety standards. The red stickers also helped health workers keep track of which households were struggling with strategic mosquito control. Mosquito control workers visited red-stickered houses weekly until their mosquito control measures improved.The result has been that in 2015, Água Branca had only seven cases of dengue, and no other mosquito-borne diseases have been reported in the city, according to the Água Branca municipal health department. This number is well below rates of mosquito-borne disease for other Brazilian towns of similar size.Vertentes, Pernambuco, which like Água Branca is in the northeast region of Brazil, has about 20,000 residents and recorded 401 cases of dengue between Jan. 3 to Jan. 16 alone. Nioaque, another similarly sized town, is located in Mato Grosso do Sul, a state that actually has a lower number of microcephaly cases linked to Zika virus than Piauí. But Nioaque has about 14,000 residents and recorded 1,524 dengue cases in December 2015.As a whole, the country saw a record 1.6 million cases of dengue fever last year.Omar Akbari, a mosquito control expert at the University of California, Riverside's Center for Disease Vector Research, isn't surprised that Água Branca has had success at eradicating mosquitoes. He says that the combination of public education, community involvement and public incentives are highly motivating to people who don't want to be labeled the ""bad guys"" when it comes to mosquito control. After all, it only takes one house to continue breeding mosquitoes that will plague the rest of the neighborhood.""Stickers make everyone in the neighborhood aware of which houses are breeding mosquitoes and which ones are not,"" he said. ""It gives you an incentive to make sure you're not the bad guy in the community.""And while the Aedes aegypti mosquito can breed in swampy, wild areas, it is an urban insect that loves to live among people and breed in small amounts of fairly clean, domesticated water. As long as Água Branca residents all continue to agree that mosquito control is important for their community, and the small town is not surrounded by swamps where mosquitoes can breed, Akbari says there's no reason this method of mosquito control can't go on working in perpetuity.He did note that the community-based initiative might face obstacles in towns that were both physically larger and in more populous communities. In larger communities, people may be less likely to know each other, which makes public-facing stickers less of an incentive.""In a larger community, this might be more difficult to achieve because it would be hard to get everyone on the same page in terms of mosquito control,"" he said.Still, Akbari, who spent his undergraduate summers making mosquito control house calls for Washoe County in Nevada, says there's no reason not to try these education and public incentive measures in all communities struggling with mosquito-borne diseases.""You'd be surprised at how little people know about mosquitoes,"" he said. ""Most people don't even know what's going on in their backyards, so I think educating the community and providing incentives will go a long way in terms of mosquito control.""Água Branca's progress has inspired state leaders to introduce the program to other towns, too.""The state's governor has already taken our initiative to other towns. We hope they experience the same success,"" said Leal. ""Cities need to sensitize their residents in this campaign so that they can better monitor the proliferation of hotspots.""Mosquito control is one of the most important facets of the battle to stop the Zika virus outbreak. If you can put a stop to the insects that are spreading it, you can keep infection rates from rising. So far, an estimated 500,000 to 1.5 million Brazilians have contracted Zika virus from 2015 to 2016, and government health officials have confirmed 583 cases of microcephaly, the birth defect that may be linked to the virus. They are still investigating more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly.Zika virus transmission is ongoing in 34 destinations around the globe, but most of them are in Latin America and the Caribbean. This post first appeared on HuffPost Brazil.

"Puerto Rico has 683 confirmed cases of the Zika virus, including 65 pregnant women with symptoms of the virus and one death, U.S. health officials said on Friday.Officials who have been tracking cases of the mosquito-borne illness since December, say five patients with suspected cases of the paralyzing nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome have tested positive for the Zika virus, according to a report published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The CDC also reported that one patient with a confirmed Zika infection died from severe thrombocytopenia, a disorder marked by abnormally low blood platelets, which are needed to help the blood clot.CDC said although deaths from Zika are rare, the death ""highlights the possibility of severe cases, as well as the need for continued outreach to raise health care providers' awareness of complications that might lead to severe disease or death,"" researchers said in the report published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality weekly Report.Zika, a virus known to cause the birth defect microcephaly, first began spreading in Puerto Rico in December. In Brazil, Zika has been linked to 1,198 confirmed cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. Zika has also been linked to other severe birth defects and with stillbirth.The World Health Organization declared Zika a global health emergency on Feb. 1. In addition to microcephaly, the agency says there is a strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome.U.S. health officials said Zika remains a public health threat in Puerto Rico, with more cases expected throughout 2016.Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico are urged to take steps to avoid mosquito bites including the use of mosquito repellent, take precautions to reduce the risk of sexual transmission of Zika, and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever. (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Bernard Orr)","huffingtonpost","left","16920","zika",348
"Powerful House Republicans told the Obama administration Thursday to use leftover funds from the Ebola fight to address the spread of Zika virus, saying it is the best way to mount a swift response to the new epidemic and that Congress could replace the money later on, if needed.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said more than $2.7 billion of the roughly $5.3 billion set aside for various agencies to respond to the deadly Ebola outbreak, which ravaged West Africa from December 2013 to late 2015, had not been obligated.In a letter to the White House, Mr. Rogers said those funds should be spent before the Congress grants President Obama's request for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to battle Zika, a mosquito-borne disease that has been linked to serious birth defects in Latin America.""These funds can and should be prioritized to meet the most pressing needs of mounting a rapid and full response to Zika,"" Mr. Rogers, Kentucky Republican, and two of his chief appropriators said in a letter to Shaun Donovan, director of the Office of Budget and Management.""If additional funds are then needed to backfill the use of these funds in the future, we stand ready to consider such a request as part of the FY 2017 appropriations process,"" the lawmakers said. ""But if an urgent response is what is required, then it seems clear that substantial funds are already available without any further delay.""The response sets up a clash between Republicans who control Congress and the administration, which insisted that using leftover funds for Ebola would hamper the lingering fight in West Africa and renege on promises the U.S. made to the global health community.Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told Congress last week that workers in Sierra Leone recently uncovered a new case of Ebola, even though transmission had been declared over.Mr. Rogers, however, said information from HHS, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department suggest there are ""substantial amounts of funding that are un-obligated and not immediately required to address the Ebola outbreak, particularly since the emergency response is winding down."" ","washingtontimes","right","16849","zika",357
"WASHINGTON -- Congress is finally moving to supply the nation's disease control experts with funding to prevent the spread of Zika in the United States, but the House of Representatives is offering only about a third of the money sought by the Obama administration.After the Senate put three competing bills on its calendar for this week -- with minimum funding of $1.1 billion -- the House Appropriations Committee announced plans for a $622 million measure.In February, President Barack Obama asked lawmakers for $1.9 billion to ramp up a host of efforts, from mosquito mitigation to education and vaccine research.The Zika virus has been conclusively shown to cause microcephaly and other birth defects when it infects pregnant women. It's also strongly suspected of causing other problems, such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome.The administration had hoped to use the money it requested to help fund a massive response, particularly ahead of the warmer months when the mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus breed and spread.But Republican leaders in Congress expressed doubts about the funding requests, and said the White House has failed to present an adequate plan or answer questions about how the money will be spent.Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) cited the disagreement as his reason for coming up with a smaller Zika budget, saying the House nevertheless wants to ensure that some funds are available.""Given the severity of the Zika crisis and the global health threat, we cannot afford to wait on the administration any longer,"" he said in a statement. ""We have made our own funding determinations, using what information is available and through discussions with federal agencies, to craft a proposal to fight the spread of this damaging disease.""""This legislation will make dollars available to fight the disease now, prioritizing critical activities that must begin immediately, such as vaccine development and mosquito control,"" Rogers added. ""The legislation funds these efforts in a responsible way, using existing resources -- including excess funding left over from the Ebola outbreak -- to pay for it.""The administration had already transferred nearly $600 million from the Ebola effort and other programs to fund its response. Rogers said the committee will consider additional funding not as an emergency, but in the regular appropriations process for 2017, which is underway now.""Every child deserves the chance at a full and healthy life, and every mother deserves to see her child thrive,"" Rogers said. ""This measure will help make sure this happens, while doing it in an effective, efficient, and responsible way.""Rogers' comments suggest Republicans realize combatting the disease will likely cost more, but also that they are not impressed with the administration's arguments against piecemeal funding, which it has said makes the response more difficult to administer.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the GOP proposal is woefully inadequate.""That is essentially the bureaucratic equivalent of digging through sofa cushions to try to come up with the necessary money,"" he said in his daily briefing. ""Our public health professionals shouldn't be reduced to doing that.""Earnest said he expects ""widespread public reporting"" about the threat of the Zika virus in the United States this summer, and that people wondering why the government didn't effectively plan to protect people from the virus should pose their questions to Congress.""My answer will be, we've been trying,"" he said.Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the appropriations committee, was also underwhelmed.""The majority's decision to underfund the President's request by $1.3 billion risks worsening an already severe crisis,"" she said in a statement. ""Without full funding, private sector work on vaccines and diagnostic testing will be delayed due to the lack of multi-year funding commitments. State and local public health emergency preparedness grants will be underfunded, hampering efforts to control mosquito populations. Failing to replenish Ebola accounts will force us to renege on commitments to fortify public health systems and hurt our ability to respond to new outbreaks.""A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan said later that the $622 million House bill should be counted on top of the money the Obama administration has already shifted from Ebola, effectively making the total $1.2 billion. This story has been updated to include comment from Ryan's spokeswoman.Jen Bendery contributed reporting.","huffingtonpost","left","16937","zika",731
"This week is full of festivities. While Americans cheered for their teams at the Super Bowl on Sunday and East Asians feast and visit temples to mark the Lunar New Year, Brazilians also got into the celebratory mood for the annual Carnival.Carnival is a five-day-long party where tourists and locals across the country flock outside to watch bands and samba schools perform. Rio de Janeiro is preparing for the Gay Gala on Tuesday, a bustling show where drag queens from around the world dance and show off their costume during an all-night party.About 5 million revelers are expected to show up to the week-long festivities this year, which started Feb. 5 and goes until Feb. 9, Agence France-Presse reported.Carnival's origins date back to at least the 18th century, when Catholic Portuguese colonists introduced to Brazil the European tradition of celebrating and indulging during the days before Lent.Lent is a 46-day period -- 40, if excluding Sundays -- before Easter in which members of the Roman Catholic Church and some other Christian denominations fast to commemorate the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert fasting. The 2016 Lenten season begins Feb. 10 on Ash Wednesday.This year's Carnival celebrations helped allay some of Brazil's tensions as economic woes and fresh fears of the Zika virus loom large in communities across the country.Unemployment is rising and inflation rates soared to about 10.6 percent in the country, its highest level in 13 years. Forty-eight Brazilian cities cancelled their 2016 Carnival celebrations due to financial restrictions, Agence France-Presse reported. Since last May, an estimated 1.5 million people in Brazil have been found infected with the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease that experts fear can also be spread through sex and blood transfusion.Prior to this weekend's celebrations, workers in Rio de Janeiro fumigated and sprayed pesticide over some Carnival locations, including the city's Sambadrome, a 72,000-seat stadium, which was built for samba parades in 1984.But, for many, the party goes on.Take a look at the most colorful photos and videos as the festivities got underway:#brazilcarnival is where the blocos are.

"House Republicans unveiled a bill Monday that funds only a third of President Obama's request to combat the Zika virus, saying the White House hadn't fully justified its pitch for nearly $2 billion to gird for the mosquito-borne illness.Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican, said his legislation posts $622 million to pursue a vaccine and boost mosquito control efforts over the next five months.""The administration has still not provided full accounting and justification for its request for Zika funds,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""Given this lack of complete information and the need to act quickly, independent determinations on necessary funding levels and federal activities to fight Zika in the current fiscal year were made.""The package would be fully paid for by using $352 million in left over funds from the fight against Ebola in West Africa and $270 million in ""unused administrative funding"" at the Health and Human Services Department.Mr. Rogers said the House can free up additional money, as needed, as part of the fiscal 2017 spending process.The White House blasted the House proposal, arguing the administration fully detailed its plans in February.""Here we are almost three months later, and we hear that some House Republican have gotten around to considering a piece of legislation that is only about a third of what our public health professionals say is fully necessary to protect the American people,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded more than 500 travel-related cases of Zika virus in the states and D.C., including a handful through sexual transmission, and officials warn it could puncture the mainland further once temperatures climb and mosquito populations flourish.Democrats say the GOP is playing Russian roulette with a major health scare by failing to pony up the $1.9 billion that administration health officials say they need to combat Zika and backfill nearly $600 million it shifted from other accounts, including $510 million from Ebola efforts, to gird for the latest health scare.Senators will stake out their positions through a series of amendment votes later this week.One amendment would fully fund Mr. Obama's request for $1.9 billion in emergency spending that is not offset, while a bipartisan compromise measure would a little more than half - $1.1 billion - of what the president wants, though top Democrats have balked at that level.""That simply is not enough,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said.Sen.

"The World Bank Group announced Thursday it will extend $150 million in financing to Latin American and Caribbean nations affected by the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease that's been linked to a serious birth defect and is estimated to have only a ""moderate"" economic impact in the short term.Initial projections by the bank say Zika will cost the region about $3.5 billion, or 0.06 percent of gross domestic product, in 2016. The damage could grow to more than 1 percent of GDP, however, in Caribbean nations that are heavily dependent on tourism.""Our analysis underscores the importance of urgent action to halt the spread of the Zika virus and to protect the health and well-being of people in the affected countries,"" bank President Jim Yong Kim said. ""The World Bank Group stands ready to support the countries affected by this health crisis and to provide additional support if needed.""The bank acknowledged that its projection assumed there would be a ""swift, well-coordinated international response"" to the virus, and that Zika's most significant health risks - and behaviors to avoid infection - apply to pregnant women.High rates of Zika transmission, particularly in Brazil, have been linked to a notable uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly.The first round of World Bank funding will support efforts to control mosquito populations that carry Zika and efforts to identify and treat at-risk persons.The Zika virus is not transmitting locally within the mainland U.S., although it has spread in Puerto Rico, where officials are taking steps to adhere to FDA guidance by importing blood supplies for transfusions from other parts of the U.S.President Obama has asked Congress for a staggering $1.8 billion to fight Zika at home and abroad, including $250 million to bolster Puerto Rico's Medicaid program, since its funding is capped and the island theoretically cannot respond as easily to emergencies.Meanwhile, scientists say the link between Zika and microcephaly is growing by the day.An article published this week in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, said scientists reported Zika virus in the amniotic fluid of a pair of Brazilian women whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly - results that suggest the virus can cross the placental barrier and infect the unborn.Scientists who conducted the tests in the northeastern state of Paraiba ruled out related viruses and said the Zika strain matched one that affected French Polynesia in a 2013 outbreak. ","washingtontimes","right","16849","zika",410
"SC Johnson is gearing up to whack a lot more mosquitoes.The home chemicals giant, which makes the insect repellent Off and the insecticide Raid, announced on Tuesday that it will donate 54,000 units of Off to the County of Hawaii Civil Defense Agency to help protect against mosquitoes that may carry dengue fever. Since an outbreak of the disease began last fall, more than 250 cases have been reported. But as Zika virus -- the mosquito-borne tropical disease linked to debilitating birth defects -- is spreading at an alarming rate from Brazil up to Mexico, the company told The Huffington Post that it is considering increasing production of its insect repellents to help deal with the crisis. ""We are absolutely going full bore ahead to help in any way we can,"" Fisk Johnson, the chairman and chief executive of the family-owned company, said Wednesday in a rare interview. ""The Hawaii donation is the tip of the iceberg of what we are going to be donating to help people around the world, especially those who cannot afford the tools that they need to protect themselves from Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases.""The Racine, Wisconsin-based company said it has approached the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the International Committee of the Red Cross about donations to fight Zika. It has yet to announce any contributions.""The whole Zika thing is so tragic,"" Johnson said. ""I really feel for what's happening around the world.""For now, executives at SC Johnson are meeting daily to discuss new information about the fast-moving Zika outbreak. So far, 35 cases of Zika have been reported in the United States, all of which were contracted while traveling abroad, according to the CDC. In Puerto Rico, 10 cases have been reported, only one of them associated with travel. One other case was reported in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The patient, like the nine others in Puerto Rico, was infected locally. Still, Johnson said his company wants to take the fight to Zika's source.""This is beyond the United States,"" Johnson said.

"The responsibility for protecting our communities in Texas from the Zika virus is local and municipal, say mosquito experts. The problem is that poorer areas do not have the expertise or the manpower because of their low tax base. Texas counties without formal mosquito districts or like services are ill-equipped to address Zika virus concerns.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ""The prevention or reduction of transmission of DENV (dengue fever), ZIKV (Zika virus), and CHIKV (chikungunya)  is completely dependent on the control of mosquito vectors and limiting person-mosquito contact.""Experts say that local control, and control by people in the community through what is called ""Source Reduction,"" is our best defense against the mosquito that bears the virus. In other words, citizens are being asked to protect themselves and our neighborhoods by eliminating the places where mosquitoes breed.Moreover, the website of the CDC provides that ""Whereas mosquito-based surveillance is the preferred method for monitoring or predicting West Nile virus outbreaks, it is not the preferred method for monitoring or predicting DENV, CHIKV, YFV (yellow fever), or ZIKV outbreaks. For these autoviruses, it is more efficient to detect cases in people.""Unfortunately, having people infected with the virus, and citizen complaints, will be in some communities, like those with smaller counties with no sophisticated formal mosquito districts or municipal health department, be the way the threat to our communities is identified. One of the functions of a mosquito control district is to conduct surveillance to detect the presence and proliferation of mosquitoes.In Texas, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services' (DSHS) website, DSHS is not responsible for conducting mosquito control spraying in the state. The state agency reports that ""Vector control is up to the mosquito-control districts and local health departments.""The term ""vector control"" refers to the methods for monitoring, controlling, and eradicating, ""any insect or anthropod, rodent, or other animal of public health significance capable of harboring or transmitting the causative agents of human disease.""Moreover, the DSHS website states that ""Mosquito control can be divided into two areas of responsibility: individual and public. Public spraying to control mosquitoes is only one of many pest-control methods used for effective long-term mosquito control.""Yet experts say that for the Zika virus, spraying is not a very effective way of dealing with the problem because of the unique characteristics of the mosquito that carries the virus.Professor Jeff Flosi, associate professor of Biology and Microbiology at the University of Houston-Downtown told Breitbart Texas, ""You cannot use the same spray technology in the same way as the West Nile virus."" He said that the mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus are diurnal, not nocturnal, and thermal heat currents carry the spray away. With traditional mosquito control spraying that occurs at night with an old-fashioned truck, the spray does not drift the same. Flosi also serves as the president of the Texas Mosquito Control Association.The Zika virus spreads through mosquito bites, in particular from the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The insect also carries diseases such as yellow fever, Chikungunya, and dengue fever. The virus is carried by the same two types of Aedes mosquitoes that carry dengue fever which is prevalent on the Texas-Mexico border, and the virus Chikungunya, which first entered the state in 2014, with more cases last year, Breitbart Texas reported.DSHS reports that ""In Texas, some city and county governmental agencies have programs for mosquito control. Very often, it is the responsibility of the property owner to address these issues to prevent the creation of a nuisance or public health threat.""The Texas agency says that ""The reduction, elimination, or treatment of mosquito-breeding areas is the best and most cost-effective technique for mosquito control,"" and that the most important thing that citizens can do is to reduce the risk of exposure. Citizens must help by not allowing water to accumulate in gutters, bird baths, tires, and plant trays and the like, for more than two days. This is what is referred to as ""Source Reduction.""Professor Flosi told Breitbart Texas, ""Remember, the mosquito will bite the hand that breeds it.""The problem can be with poorer areas of the state. In those areas, as they are in all social funding, for example, sanitation and school districts to name a few, these areas are underfunded to deal with the issue. It is a ""tax-base issue"" says Baylor University professor Richard Duhrkopf. He serves as an associate professor of Biology and is on the Board of Directors of the Texas Mosquito Control Association.Poorer areas of the state, including counties along the Texas-Mexico border, often have citizens who are less educated. Moreover, mosquito control districts are not there to help with education.The agency suggests that citizens help with the following in order to eliminate the potential of mosquito-breeding sites in your community and in the environment:The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed six travel-related cases of the Zika virus last week and public health officials and medical providers were bracing for more cases. Officials are worried that this could be just the tip of the iceberg, reported Breitbart Texas' Merrill Hope.As reported by Breitbart News' Mary Chastain, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned this past week that the Zika virus in Latin America has ""explosive pandemic potential.""The danger of the virus in Texas and the states initially comes from travel to, or from those who have been in El Salvador, Brazil, and Columbia. These countries in particular have seen a huge outbreak of the virus.Breitbart News reported that Brazil launched a door-to-door campaign using 220,000 soldiers. There have been 4,000 fetus affected cases reported and approximately 200 more are diagnosed every week.Breitbart News reported that Brazilian authorities have documented thousands of cases of pregnant women diagnosed with Zika giving birth to babies with microcephaly. Children with microcephaly typically suffer severe mental damage.The ""microcephaly epidemic,"" as it is referred to in an BBC Brasil article, is reported to affect at least 20 Brazilian states or more and the federal district. Ancenephaly is a condition in which a fetus is missing a portion of the brain, skull, or scalp. Microcephaly is defined as an abnormal smallness of the head, a congenital condition associated with incomplete brain development.Texas Governor Greg Abbott took action on Thursday and appointed an infectious disease task force to prepare for the Zika virus in the Lone Star state. He appointed 31 members to the Task Force on Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response, as reported by Breitbart Texas.The task force was created ""to provide expert, evidence-based assessments, protocols, and recommendations related to state responses to infectious diseases, and to serve as a reliable and transparent source of information and education for Texas leadership and citizens,"" according to a statement from the Governor's office.Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

"The Zika virus outbreak is exposing a ghastly secret that the environmentalist movement wants hidden, even if the cost is more Zika-babies.Zika is spread primarily by mosquitoes, so killing the mosquitoes is the best way to keep the virus from spreading. The major outbreak areas in South America have long histories of struggling with mosquito control. One reason is their inability to obtain effective pesticides, principally the mosquito-killer DDT, due to environmentalists' fierce and utterly faked junk-science.The DDT ban was the first epic victory of environmentalist junk science, so the Greens will never walk it back, no matter how many people sicken and die because of their ""triumph.""With tens of millions of people already killed by malaria unnecessarily, a few thousand Zika victims will add little to the butcher's bill.To this day, news organizations cite their DDT hoax as if it was true. But it wasn't - the pesticide caused none of the problems laid at its feet, including the infamous thinning of bird shells alleged by the 1962 book Silent Spring. This was known at the time, as reputable scientific research knocked down the anti-DDT allegations  only to be overridden by political considerations.Dr. Robert Zubrin, author of a recent book on junk science, succinctly summed up the DDT saga in a National Review article, calling for the return of the much-maligned, highly effective pesticide:The enthusiasm of people who thought the Earth was overpopulated for banning life-saving DDT really should have been a tip-off to the true agenda behind the ban. The population-bomb crowd definitely got what it wanted. Dr. Wenceslaus Kilama, chairman of the Malaria Foundation International, once compared the death toll from Africa's malaria epidemic to ""loading up seven Boeing 747 airliners each day, then deliberately crashing them into Mt. Kilimanjaro.""Here we are again, with a disease much less deadly than malaria, but nevertheless of great concern to people around the world, and we're prevented from using our most effective weapons against the insects that spread it.That's because the environmentalist movement would never recover its clout if its DDT victory is revealed as a contributor to the Zika disaster. That might cause people to look at the false ""settled history"" of the 1970s anti-DDT campaign. Too many of the methods used in other junk-science crusades were honed against DDT, and Silent Spring is too important as a cornerstone of environmentalist mythology.""Will the environmental bureaucrats continue to block the use of essential life-saving pesticides, and thereby cause an even worse global catastrophe that will go on for generations?"" asks Dr. Zubrin, already knowing the answer.The arguments against bringing DDT back to fight Zika instantly spin off into speculation and hypothesis.  For example, Newsweek cites Joe Conlon of the American Mosquito Control Association delivering the hardy perennial argument that DDT might not work as well today, because some strains of mosquitoes might have developed a resistance to it, or they might become resistant if we begin spraying them again. They might even develop improved resistance to other pesticides after exposure to DDT.Those sound like hypotheses to be tested, not reasons to avoid trying everything we can. Words like ""might,"" ""could,"" ""may,"" and ""probably"" are peppered through every paragraph of the Newsweek anti-DDT story.Conlon also sets up the classic false choice between bathing South America in billowing clouds of DDT, or pursuing more holistic solutions, such as a ""change in culture"" that would make residents of Zika outbreak areas more aggressive about eliminating pools of standing water, depriving mosquitoes of easy breeding grounds. That sounds like good advice, but why not use our most effective pesticides in a carefully controlled manner, to reduce the immediate threat while waiting for that ""change in culture"" to take hold?Some postulate that the pesticides that are being used in places like Brazil are responsible for the birth defects blamed on the Zika virus. The more extreme versions of this theory posit that Zika is essentially a hoax concocted to hide the perfidy of spray-happy agricultural concerns in South America - the virus is real enough, but it doesn't cause any of the horrible secondary effects linked to it. If the pesticides currently used in the area are dangerous and ineffective, a dramatic change in strategy is worth considering.As to the cause of those birth defects, the official position of the World Health Organization, according to its chief Margaret Chan, is that a WHO emergency committee agreed ""a causal relationship between the Zika infection during pregnancy and microcephaly is strongly suspected, though not scientifically proven."" The number of severe Guillain-Barre syndrome reactions in Zika patients is also a matter of serious concern.Given the lack of a vaccine for Zika, and the enduring uncertainty about its effects, fighting the mosquito carriers is a key part of any containment strategy. Such is the case in Florida, where a state of public health emergency has been declared in several counties.Reuters notes that ""the types of mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, are common in Florida, where mosquito season is year-round, and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, including Houston.""There are already signs of Florida mosquito control departments stepping up their efforts, with Hillsborough County ""paying workers overtime as it steps up spraying, mosquito monitoring, and misting in the area of the home of someone who had Zika.""The Reuters piece mentions plans to educate people about the importance of removing standing-water mosquito breeding grounds - the ""change in culture"" recommended above for the outbreak areas - while also expanding pesticide deployment. Northern states like Illinois and New York have a little respite from the Zika threat, due to the dormancy of mosquitoes in winter, but will soon have to think about intensifying their own control programs, especially if more Zika-infected travelers return home.Interestingly, Reuters specifically mentions the ""decline in use of pesticides such as DDT,"" along with the increase in international travel, as factors behind notorious outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, chikungunya, the West Nile virus, and our old nemesis malaria.At the moment, America, Canada, and Europe are facing very small numbers of Zika patients, with the vast majority of the infections acquired during travel to the outbreak regions.But South America is looking at up to four million cases this year, potentially translating to thousands of cases of microcephaly and neurological disorders. Effective vaccines are estimated to be at least three years away. The advice given to avoid Zika's effects consists of suggestions like ""don't get pregnant.""An ounce of prevention will be worth many pounds of the cure that doesn't exist yet, and the only prevention available at the moment involves killing the mosquitoes, as effectively as possible.","breitbart","right","16836","zika",1140
"Fears over the Zika virus forced Major League Baseball to relocate a planned two-game series from San Juan to Miami.The series, scheduled for May 30-31 in Puerto Rico, now takes place at Miami Marlins Park.

There had been no infections, he said, since one locally transmitted case, the country's 14th, was reported on March 15.Cuba has called out the military to help fumigate, activated neighborhood watch groups to check there is no standing water, where the insects breed, instituted health checks at airports and other entry points to the Caribbean island, among other measures.A source in the health ministry, with access to epidemiological data, told Reuters last week that there was no Zika transmission.""We are all over it. Every time someone enters the country from Brazil or Venezuela or wherever and comes down with Zika, more than 20 cases so far, we isolate them and check their neighborhoods,"" the source said, asking not to be identified as the information is considered classified.The source has contradicted official reports in the past due to the individual's concern for public health.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,300 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in mothers.The United States and Cuba signed an historic agreement last week to collaborate on health issues, including Zika, as part of detente begun in December 2014.Media quoted Health Minister Morales as stating that due to efforts to date, there were no reported cases of Chikungunya, another mosquito-spread virus, and that Dengue, endemic to the region, had been all but eliminated.""Dengue, which when we began our intensive campaign was present in 14 provinces and the special municipality of the Isla de la Juventud, today is present in only one municipality in Guantanamo province,"" he said.(Reporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Dan Grebler)","huffingtonpost","left","16981","zika",431
"An influential conservative group told Congress on Friday to pay for an emerging deal to combat the Zika virus by swiping dollars from other programs or using the annual budget process to prioritize the fight over other spending.Heritage Action offered a wish list of programs for appropriators to tap, such $235 million for the Paris climate-change pact and nearly $50 million in employer subsidies for members of Congress who use the Obamacare exchange.""As you consider the Obama administration's funding request to respond to the Zika virus, we urge you to reaffirm the importance of prioritizing federal spending. Every day, all across the country, Americans are faced with difficult financials decisions that require sacrifice and prioritization. Lawmakers should hold themselves to the same standard,"" the organization told House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican, and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran, Mississippi Republican.Mr. Cochran on Thursday said senators are close to striking a deal to spend hundreds of millions of dollars fighting the Zika virus, as health officials' warnings about birth defects and political pressure from Democrats have forced the GOP to the negotiating table.He didn't say how much they planned to spend, though Democrats say the starting point is slightly more than $1 billion, or more than half of the $1.9 billion President Obama requested.The White House has already shifted $510 million from the fight against Ebola in West Africa and $89 million from other accounts toward Zika, but Mr. Obama says much more is needed.""About $600 million is already out the door,"" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said Thursday. ""We still need answers to the questions about where it's going. So we see our job as being good stewards of the taxpayer dollars as making sure that we have answers to our questions about how we fund these things.""Conservatives want to slash $30 billion from a budget deal the parties agreed to last fall, so they are reluctant to post billions more to tackle Zika, the lead-tainted water crisis in Flint, Mich., and the prescription opioids and heroin epidemic.""I think this is something that could be offset, and I would favor that,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, said Friday of the emerging Zika deal.Democrats, though, say the search for offsets would bog down the process, putting their states at risk.Zika is spreading locally in Latin America and Puerto Rico but could swirl in the states once temperatures climb, allowing disease-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to multiply faster.""We didn't need [on offset] on Ebola. We had four cases of Ebola and we appropriated $4 billion in emergency funding,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, said Thursday. ""We've already had hundreds of cases of Zika. I'm not sure why it would be a different standard.""""I think moving forward, we need to have reservoir funds to be able to use to get out of these crises,"" he added. We have to get out of this habit of waiting until an epidemic is on us to be able to appropriate dollars."" ","washingtontimes","right","16913","zika",511
"The World Health Organization (WHO) warned this week that the Zika virus in Latin America has ""explosive pandemic potential."" Patients often experience mild symptoms with Zika, but pregnant women face a larger danger.Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which causes infants to be born with a skull too small for their brains. This leads to serious mental disabilities.Officials consider microcephaly a neurodevelopmental disorder. The disorder causes a child's head to be smaller than children of the same age.Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the outbreak of Zika, however, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases compared to the 147 in 2014. These are some of the victims.Aedes aegypti mosquitos carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations (Chile and Canada are the exceptions). They also carry Dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya. Doctors found the disease in one infant during an autopsy and numerous mothers reported symptoms.""The level of alarm is extremely high, as is the level of uncertainty. Questions abound,"" declared the head of WHO. ""We need to get some answers quickly.""She also warned people they ""don't need to travel to get the disease.""Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia have advised women from getting pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Tara Goodin told the media the agencies and others are working ""to rapidly implement appropriate donor deferral measures for travelers who have visited affected regions in order to protect the blood supply in the United States.""Canada is not home to the mosquito, but officials are not ""ruling out changes to it blood-donation policy.""""We are carefully monitoring the zika virus issue and are considering revisions to our travel deferral policies in order to protect the Canadian blood supply from the threat of this virus,"" clarified Dr. Dana Devine, Chief Medical and Scientific Officer for Canadian Blood Services.The United States has confirmed 31 Zika cases.

"Federal regulators have greenlighted the first human trial of a vaccine for Zika virus, a pair of pharmaceutical companies said Monday, though a fully approved shot against the mosquito-borne disease could still be more than a year away.Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life Sciences said they have 40 healthy participants lined up for doses of its DNA-based vaccine, which produced robust antibodies against Zika during animal testing.""We are proud to have attained the approval to initiate the first Zika vaccine study in human volunteers,"" Inovio President and CEO J. Joseph Kim said, noting 58 countries were experiencing local transmission as of May. ""The incidences of viral infection and medical conditions caused by the virus are expanding, not contracting.""Multiple entities are pursuing a vaccine for Zika, which is causing birth defects in infants born to infected mothers in Latin America, though any product must go through a series of trials and regulatory approvals before it is widely distributed.Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, has said a finished vaccine might not be available until early 2018.President Obama has requested $1.9 billion in emergency spending to speed the pursuit of a vaccine and better diagnostic test for Zika, while bolstering local mosquito control efforts.Instead, congressional negotiators are reconciling a House plan that takes $622 million from the lingering fight against Ebola in West Africa and other health accounts to fight Zika with a Senate plan that posts $1.1 billion without paying for it with cuts elsewhere in the federal budget.Negotiators appeared close to a deal on funding levels last week, but remain stuck on how - or even whether - to offset the money or tack the expense onto the deficit so that taxpayers foot the bill later on.The administration told Congress to work faster Monday, saying local entities will need a fiscal boost to adequately defend against the disease.""While federal, state and local leaders have been hard at work, congressional Republicans continue to drag their feet. This is a public health emergency, and Congress needs to stop playing politics with the health and safety of the American people,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.The Centers for Disease Control has recorded more than 750 travel-related cases of Zika in the 50 states and the District, a handful of them through sexual transmission, though experts say the virus could puncture the mainland further once summer ramps up.Florida is particularly vulnerable to local transmission, because its hot and wet climate offers a hospitable environment to Aedes mosquitos that carry Zika.Rep. Vern Buchanan, Florida Republican, said Congress will be abdicating its core responsibility to the American people - public safety - if it breaks for a weeklong recess Friday without authorizing funds to combat Zika.""Today is the first day of summer, which means mosquito season is here, and that means the Zika virus is here,"" Mr. Buchanan said. ""People's lives are at stake - the time for inaction is over.""Mr. Buchanan and Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, both support Mr. Obama's request for nearly $2 billion in emergency spending for Zika. ","washingtontimes","right","16972","zika",519
"In an op-ed, El Salvador Vice Minister of Health Eduardo Espinoza stated the government uses mosquito-eating fish to fight against the Zika virus.Espinoza wrote in The New York Times:Tech Times reported that restaurants and schools use the sambo fish in any container used for standing water.""The fish eat the larvae of the mosquitoes and stop them from developing into breeding adults that spread the virus,"" wrote Jan Dizon.Aedes aegypti mosquitos carry the Zika virus. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations. (Chile and Canada are the exceptions.) They also carry Dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya. Doctors found the disease in an infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.Health worker Marielos Sosa said officials in La Libertad used the fish between 2012 and 2015. The experiment resulted with ""zero cases of dengue"" and ""no cases of chikungunya and so far no cases of Zika either.""""It's easier to eliminate breeding grounds of mosquitoes than to limit people's desire to be a mother or a father,"" explained Julio Morales, director of the Unicentro hospital. ""Killing the larva is fundamental. If people don't understand that, we're never going to stop this virus.""Salvadorian officials have been urging women to avoid pregnancy due to alleged links between Zika and microcephaly. the country reported over 5,000 Zika cases in 2015 ""and in the first weeks of 2016.""""The recommendation is that people plan their pregnancies, that they avoid if at all possible to have babies this year,"" stressed Espinoza. ""This is the first time that we have suffered an attack of Zika virus, and the first attack is always the worst.""Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stated the disorder is typically uncommon.

In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.The government has also employed fumigators to kill the mosquitos. Workers don masks and suits as they ""go from house to house, knocking on the doors to drive out the mosquitoes."" Unfortunately, gang warfare dominates the country, which causes fear and mistrust within the public. Health workers cannot enter some locations. If they find a way in, most people do not open their doors.Claudia Muñoz said teenagers and children ""tag along behind health workers on their rounds and report back to gang leaders."" The gangs and the children believe the health workers are spies for competing gangs.Health inspectors often find stagnant water inside houses they inspect. Muñoz said many neighborhoods lack fresh water, so residents will ""store fresh water in buckets and barrels."" Inspectors discover mosquito larvae in most of the containers, too. The residents claim they try to kill the larvae.""It's a lack of education,"" he claimed. ""The problem is we've become so irresponsible we think the government has to solve all our problems.

"The government of Colombia has confirmed 32 cases of infant birth defects tied to the Zika virus, while a total number of 50 cases are investigated for ties to the disease. While birth defects tied to Zika have been rampant in Brazil, these are the first cases outside the epicenter of the Zika outbreak currently underway in South America.The birth defect in question is microcephaly, a condition where an infant is born with a skull too small for his or her head. The skull crushes the brain, causing a variety of neurological abnormalities. Brazilian health authorities have asserted that they believe ""most"" of the more than 5,000 cases of microcephaly surfacing since the Zika outbreak began have been caused by the virus, but outside of Brazil, Zika has not been found to cause as many fetal abnormalities. USA Today notes that Panama, Martinique, and the United States have both documented one case each of microcephaly believed to be related to Zika. The African nation of Cape Verde has documented another two. Colombia now has 32.The Brazilian virologist who first identified the presence of Zika in the country, Gubio Soares, suggested in February that one reason it has taken years to find a link between microcephaly and Zika contamination is that previous outbreaks have occurred in countries where abortion is unregulated, and women who did not know they were carrying Zika likely aborted their children when told they would be born with severe neurological problems. In Brazil, abortion is legal only in cases where the mother's health is endangered, and each abortion must be approved by a judge.The Spanish-language newswire service EFE notes that Colombian medical officials have documented 50 cases of microcephaly this year, twenty more than the record annual number of cases. If diagnoses continue to occur at this pace, Colombia will have documented 500 cases of Zika-related birth defects by the end of the year.The Zika virus does not trigger symptoms in eighty percent of its carriers. In the twenty percent who do exhibit signs of contamination, the symptoms are described as milder forms of those associated with Dengue fever: flu-like fatigue, conjunctivitis, and fever. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued an announcement this week definitively concluding Zika can cause microcephaly. ""Based on observation, cohort, and control studies, there exists a strong scientific consensus that Zika is a cause of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), microcephaly, and other neurological disorders,"" the WHO said in a statement.GBS is a neurological disorder that causes extreme muscle pain, paralysis, and death. It is treatable through physical therapy or administering immunoglobulin or human albumin intravenously. It has surfaced most commonly in Venezuela, as years of socialist mismanagement of its health care system has left the nation struggling to overcome a severe drug shortage. At least 11 people have died in Venezuela of GBS believed to have ties to Zika contamination, with a total of 3,000 GBS cases suspected of having its origins in Zika infection.Definitively linking microcephaly to Zika is a difficult task for doctors because of the many potential causes of such a birth defect. The U.S. Centers of Disease Control (CDC) list rubella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, severe malnutrition, alcohol, drugs, and toxic chemicals as potential causes of microcephaly. Confirmed cases are those where doctors have confirmed the presence of Zika in the infant's bloodstream, not just the mother's. Confirming the presence of Zika can be difficult in smaller clinics in the more remote locations in Latin America that have been hit hardest by the Zika outbreak.The CDC is hosting a summit Friday for medical experts to discuss the latest developments on the fight to contain Zika as spring and summer weather approach in the United States. The most common way to contract Zika is through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, present in all countries of the Western Hemisphere save for Chile and Canada. Doctors have also documented several cases of sexually-transmitted Zika.""The mosquitoes that carry Zika virus are already active in U.S. territories, hundreds of travelers with Zika have already returned to the continental U.S., and we could well see clusters of Zika virus in the continental U.S. in the coming months. Urgent action is needed, especially to minimize the risk of exposure during pregnancy,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden said of the conference.","breitbart","right","16892","zika",718

"By John Swartzberg, M.D.Recently, I got a call from a young woman who is planning her wedding. She and her fiancée have booked a honeymoon in South America, but with outbreaks of the mosquito-borne Zika virus, she's rethinking her plans. ""Should we go?"" she asked me. ""We're planning on trying to get pregnant, but probably not for at least six months after the wedding. Would that be safe?""What she wanted was an absolutely certain answer -- and that's something I couldn't give her. Zika virus has been linked to cases of microcephaly in newborns whose mothers were infected while pregnant. Based on everything we know about how viruses behave, and about Zika in particular, it seems very unlikely that getting pregnant six months after a honeymoon in Latin America or the Caribbean would pose any risk to her unborn baby. But can I tell her with 100 percent certainty that she's perfectly safe? No.Get answers to Urgent Questions about Zika Virus. What we know about Zika continues to evolve. And recommendations from the best experts about travel, testing, and pregnancy continue to change. Here's what we do know -- or at least what we're pretty sure of -- as of the time I'm writing this:For U.S. residents, Zika is primarily a travel-acquired disease.As of late March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 312 cases of Zika virus in the United States, all acquired during travel. Of those, 27 were pregnant women.No one has developed ""locally acquired"" Zika in the U.S. Now, it's likely that as the weather gets warmer we will see cases crop up, especially in the southern parts of United States -- south Florida, the Gulf Coast or Baja California. But Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that carries Zika, as well as other viruses like dengue fever and chikungunya, does not over-winter well outside tropical and sub-tropical climates, so we don't expect large local outbreaks of the disease in the United Sates.For most people, Zika is a mild disease.Only about 20 percent of people infected with the virus actually become ill. The most common symptoms are fever, rash, joint pain, and redness in the eyes. It's usually mild, with symptoms lasting for a few days to a week. The mildness, of course, is a double-edged sword: Because many people show no symptoms at all, and others may mistake the symptoms for a slight case of flu. So it's possible not to realize that you've been infected with the virus. And while experts believe that the incubation period -- the time between being bitten by an infected mosquito and showing signs of being ill -- is probably between three days to a week, they don't know for sure. Zika has been linked to microcephaly. Microcephaly is a birth defect in which the baby's head size is smaller than expected, often a sign of abnormal brain development. The relationship between the Zika virus and birth defects such as microcephaly is still not well understood, but the evidence is mounting that there is a direct connection:Teams of scientists from CDC are now in Brazil, where the connection was first identified, working with local health officials to conduct the first large-scale investigation into Zika and microcephaly. That research will take time. We now know that when a woman becomes infected with rubella, also known as German measles, during her first trimester of pregnancy, her baby has up to an 80 percent chance of being born with a wide range of birth defects -- including deafness, eye defects, heart defects, and cognitive impairments -- known as congenital rubella syndrome. But it took more than a decade for that link to be definitively verified. We are likely to know still more about Zika and microcephaly in May, when two ""case control"" studies are expected, but the World Health Organization has said that it's likely to be closer to six months before we can say with some certainty that there is a direct connection. So what should you do until then? If you're pregnant or want to become pregnant soon, you should postpone travel to Zika outbreak areas.The CDC's most current recommendation is that pregnant women in any trimester delay trips to any area where the Zika virus is spreading. If your partner is pregnant, postpone travel to Zika outbreak areas or use protection when you return.Men who have traveled to a Zika-infected area are cautioned to abstain from sex or use a condom if their partner is pregnant for at least eight weeks -- Zika can be spread through sexual contact. If you have already traveled to a Zika-affected area, get tested.If you are pregnant and have already traveled to a place where Zika is spreading, the CDC recommends that you have a blood test. This is especially important if you've developed any of the symptoms of Zika infection during your trip, or within two weeks after returning. Delay donating blood if you have traveled to a Zika-affected area.The Red Cross has also asked people who have traveled to Mexico, the Caribbean, or Central or South America to defer donating blood or platelets until 28 days after their return. The virus is typically only found in the blood for a week to ten days after exposure, but they are acting with an abundance of caution in order to protect the blood supply.Regardless of travel, protect yourself from mosquitoes, especially if pregnant.Be vigilant against mosquito bites, particularly if you live in a warm climate. That means:I wish I could provide more definite, absolute answers, but at this point, even the experts don't have nearly as much information as we wish we had. Nature always has a way of surprising us. The most prudent advice I have, if you have been in a Zika-affected area recently or have plans to travel to one of those areas, is to check the CDC Zika website regularly, and follow their recommendations.  Also, consult with a doctor who is knowledgeable about this disease -- an infectious diseases expert who is board certified by the Infectious Disease Society of America.Stay safe with these tips:John Swartzberg, M.D., is chair of the editorial board of BerkeleyWellness.com and the UC Berkeley Wellness Letter. on Twitter.","huffingtonpost","left","16892","zika",1074
"Brazilian scientists detected live Zika virus in human saliva and urine, which may indicate that a person in contact with these bodily fluids can contract the virus.""I think we need to be careful that don't we jump to any conclusions about transmissibility,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""When you find a virus or fingerprints of a virus in a body secretion, it absolutely does not mean that it is transmitted that way.""Saliva can hold HIV, but cannot spread the disease.Others said the ""low levels"" can make it ""impossible or unlikely"" to transfer to another person. Substances in the saliva could also prevent transmission.""I think it's important to step back and emphasize that Zika is a mosquito-borne virus and the overwhelming majority of cases are spread by mosquitoes,"" stated Thomas Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry the disease.

This leads to serious mental disabilities. The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon.Doctors reported 404 cases of microcephaly in newborns since November. They tied seventeen ""to the Zika virus."" Fifteen of the 404 passed away, ""with five linked to Zika."" Authorities are investigating 56 other deaths and 3,670 cases.The Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) confirmed a person received the virus after ""sexual contact with an individual with Zika.""""Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,"" explained Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director. ""Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any sexually-transmitted infections.""The CDC published new safe-sex guidelines due to the fear of microcephaly. The scientists told men with Zika to ""use a condom or abstain from sex until the baby is born.""Sperm banks in the United Kingdom and the U.S. have changed policies to protect clients from the Zika virus.The British Fertility Society asked people who traveled to areas with Zika, mainly South America and the Caribbean, not to donate sperm for 28 days.The California Cryobank will not allow donations from anyone who traveled to those countries or ""have had sex with someone who has traveled there within the past month."" Doctors must report any patient who left the U.S. or Canada.

"The government of Colombia has confirmed 3,100 cases of pregnant women with the Zika virus, but no cases of the birth defect microcephaly.Zika has infected around 25,000 people in the country. President Juan Manuel Santos believes the country will witness ""600,000 cases before the epidemic reaches its ceiling.""Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the outbreak of Zika, however, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week.

Colombian officials confirmed three deaths connected to the syndrome. Santos estimates 1,000 cases of Guillan-Barré before the outbreak ends.A survivor based in New York City told CBS News his joints ""felt like lead weights."" The ""prize-winning Brazilian-American well known in the performing arts"" did not want CBS to identify him.The man known as João and twelve colleagues contracted Zika last spring while in Brazil.

The lack of data worries Colombian officials because the countries share borders.""This is a serious problem,"" stated Gaviria.The Norte de Santandar province, which shares a border with Venezuela, has the highest amount of Zika cases in Colombia.

"ANALYSIS/OPINION:Avoid all nonessential travel to countries with endemic Zika. That was the key message from scientific experts at a hearing the House Science, Space and Technology Committee held on May 25.We should heed their advice. Thus far, every Zika case in the continental United States has been attributed to travel-associated exposure. Although there have been around 1,300 locally acquired infections reported in American Samoa, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Zika cases reported in the mainland United States are infections picked up while traveling outside our country.If Americans continue to believe it is safe to travel to countries where the Zika virus is rampant, more will return home with infections. This increases the risks for all of us, whether we travel abroad or not. If a mosquito bites a person who has carried Zika into the United States, that mosquito can infect every other person it bites. This is how epidemics spread.During the Science Committee's hearing, I asked our witnesses about the risks posed by travel to countries where Zika infection rates are highest. Why has the administration not raised the travel alert level for countries with the highest number of Zika infections, such as Brazil and Colombia? Is the administration so worried about attendance at the Olympic Games in Brazil this summer that it is willing to endanger American lives by not providing better warnings?No one has answers to these questions. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has issued only Level 2 travel alerts, which advise travelers to only ""practice enhanced precautions."" It has not issued any Level 3 warnings to ""avoid nonessential travel,"" as it did with the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.The World Health Organization (WHO) in February declared Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This declaration is reserved for a situation that is ""serious, unusual or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected State's national border; and may require immediate international action.""But neither the CDC nor the WHO go far enough to protect the health of travelers throughout the world. While CDC alerts include special precautions for pregnant women, the warnings for men and women hardly seem sufficient when compared to the potential consequences. Instead of demanding that Congress provide more funds for activities that may or may not be effective in stopping the virus, the administration should start with one simple step that would be guaranteed to slow the spread of Zika to the United States: raise the travel alert to Level 3 for Brazil, Colombia and other countries with high levels of Zika infections.Immediately after our May 25 hearing, 150 prominent individuals with scientific, academic and other public health backgrounds called for the Summer Olympic Games in Brazil to be moved or postponed because of concerns over the Zika virus. More recently, some international health experts suggested that the spread of Zika in the United States this summer would cause other nations to tell their citizens not to travel to our southern states.Even without prudent prompting from our government, many individual Americans and groups are making other travel plans. Major League Baseball moved a two-game May series from Puerto Rico to Florida. The USA Swimming National Team director, in moving pre-Olympics training from Puerto Rico to Georgia, explained, ""According to the CDC and other health experts in the field of science and medicine, our athletes would be highly exposed to the Zika virus in Puerto Rico."" What about the risks for our Olympians and American spectators and others in Brazil, which has more Zika infections than any nation?Summer in the United States will begin officially at 6:34 a.m. EDT on June 20, which will mark the start of Zika season here. Our citizens, men and women, pregnant or otherwise, need their government to provide accurate information about the potential risks of traveling to countries where the Zika virus is spreading. The Obama administration has no excuse not to raise the travel warnings to Level 3 for Brazil and Colombia and probably other countries. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, is chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. ","washingtontimes","right","16967","zika",688
"As Latin America scrambles to help explain the Zika pandemic that has affected over a million people in the Western Hemisphere so far, conspiracy theories pushed by Russia and anti-Western outlets have begun to gather steam in social media and alternative news outlets.The New York Times reports that multiple conspiracy theories blaming Western scientific advances for Zika - and the thousands of cases of microcephaly in Brazilian infants - have begun to grow in popularity. The lesser of these theories arose in Argentina, where a group of doctors alleged that Zika is no threat and that Brazil's microcephaly cases are the product of widespread use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen. The theory is a tempting explanation, as the Zika virus does not cause any symptoms in 80 percent of its patients and, in the few cases where it does, causes only mild symptoms. Zika has become a threat almost exclusively to pregnant mothers, as it appears to cause the microcephaly defect in the unborn.Doctors have warned, however, that it may also trigger Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, a neurological condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves and causes severe pain, paralysis, and death. The link between Zika and Guillain-Barré remains unclear.Both Brazilian authorities and the World Health Organization immediately rejected the claim that pyriproxyfen, and not Zika, is responsible for Brazil's more than 4,000 microcephaly cases. ""Unlike the relationship between the Zika virus and microcephaly, which has had its confirmation attested in tests that indicated the presence of the virus in samples of blood, tissue and amniotic fluid, the association between the use of pyriproxyfen and microcephaly has no scientific basis,"" the Brazilian Health Ministry confirmed in a statement.With Zika back to being the suspected culprit, conspiracy theorists have begun to blame Western science for allegedly increasing Brazil's mosquito population, making it easier for Zika to spread. The New York Times notes that the most popular conspiracy theory surrounding Zika is that the British corporation Oxitec spread Zika through genetically modified Aedes aegypti mosquitos, the species that carries the virus.These mosquitos also carry dengue, Chikungunya virus, and yellow fever, making them the subject of a 2012 Oxitec experiment in which Aedes aegypti males were rendered sterile and their lifespans decreased significantly. Flooding the local mosquito population with these males forced viable mates out of the competition for females; the females would then have larvae with extremely short lifespans. Some, the newspaper notes, ""see it as a plot by global elites to depopulate the earth and install a 'one-world government.'"" The Times notes that ""American actor Mark Ruffalo was among those sounding the alarm, with a post on Monday that was shared nearly 500 times.""Much of the conversation blaming Oxitec comes from Russia. Propaganda outlet Russia Today published a story this month claiming that some experts are ""raising questions"" about the Oxitec experiment, likening the experiment to ""the plot of a Hollywood blockbuster."" ""At the time, concerns were raised about the release of GMMs without further studies into possible side effects,"" RT says of the project, citing a British drama as evidence that ""suggests it could be a deliberate plan to reduce the global population.""The theory that the West is behind the Zika epidemic has not only hit Russian propaganda publications. Russian officials have begun suggesting that the United States created the Zika virus to use as a population control method. ""Why am I still worried about the Abkhazian coast, which houses the mosquito? somewhere the 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the place where this mosquito lives today is a military microbiology laboratory of the United States Army,"" Gennady Onishchenko, Russia's former chief sanitary doctor, said in an interview this week. ""The presence of American laboratories and the presence of the mosquito, I am concerned about in terms of deliberate interference in the natural course of epidemic process."" The scientific facility Onishchenko refers to is run by the Georgian government, though it was built by the U.S. Army, and there is no evidence of Zika-related projects underway there.Such theories have spread to Portuguese-language media and, of course, English-language outlets like Infowars, which ran a headline calling Zika a ""bioweapon"" and implicating Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in the epidemic.Contrary to online theories, the Oxitec experiment appears to have succeeded in the region of Brazil where it took place. ""Data collected by the city and Oxitec suggest the program has decreased the number of wild mosquitoes by more than 80 percent in the treated neighborhoods,"" the MIT Technology Review reports. The reduction in mosquito population in two neighborhoods reduced the number of cases of dengue ""from 133 in a year to only one.""The World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the Oxitec experiment and others like it this week.The conspiracy theories surrounding Zika recall those spreading in 2014 about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. There, the Liberian Observer, one of the nation's largest newspapers, ran a column claiming that the United States government had manufactured Ebola and the HIV as ""products of the cold war,"" citing ""reports"" and a science fiction novel. This time around, Chris Brown became the celebrity to claim Ebola was a ""form of population control,"" the result of such hysteria being widespread attacks on Western medical volunteers working to save Ebola patients.Brazil has so far recorded over 4,000 cases of microcephaly, with the few infants undergoing testing confirmed to have been carrying Ebola before their deaths. Brazil remains the only country in the region with significant numbers of suspected Ebola cases to also see a surge in microcephaly cases.","breitbart","right","16849","zika",927
"By: Mindy Weisberger Published: 01/15/2016 02:34 AM EST on LiveScienceThe rapid spread of a disease called Zika virus urgently requires attention, two leading researchers say.Zika virus is the most recent in a list of viruses that were formerly confined to remote niches of the world but are now expanding their reach into the Northern Hemisphere.Much about these viruses is still poorly understood, wrote Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr. David Morens, senior scientific advisor for the NIAID, in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday (Jan. 14).Zika virus is carried by mosquitos and causes generally mild symptoms like fever and rashes. However, it has recently been linked to an alarming rise in newborns with microcephaly -- a condition causing reduced brain development and abnormally small heads -- in Brazil. Ten times as many cases were reported there in 2015 than in previous years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).In their new article, Fauci and Morens evaluated the extent of the threat posed by this fast-spreading virus.Health officials have been aware of Zika virus for 60 years, but it is only within the past year that data gathered from infected populations hinted at the more severe consequence of infection, the researchers said. [Tiny & Nasty: Images of Things That Make Us Sick]In French Polynesia, an epidemic of diverse neurologic conditions happened concurrently with Zika virus outbreaks, suggesting an association between the two. And some public health officials have attributed the recent and alarming spike in infants with microcephaly in Brazil to Zika infections contracted by women while they were pregnant.However, Fauci and Morens warn, it's too soon to conclude that Zika virus is definitely responsible for these conditions. Commercial tests for Zika are yet to be developed, and it is possible that a closely related disease, like dengue virus, actually caused some suspected Zika infections, the researchers said.""Intensive investigative research"" is required to look at the possible link between the virus and the birth defects, Fauci and Morens said. But even if no link is discovered, researchers must learn more about Zika, they said.Expanding northOn Dec. 31, the CDC reported the first locally acquired Zika virus case in Puerto Rico, farther north in the Americas than ever seen before. And on Monday (Jan. 11), a traveler who had recently returned to the United States from Latin America was diagnosed with Zika in Houston, according to the Texas' Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services (HCPHES).Harris County officials stated that the infected person had symptoms ""that are often associated with the Zika virus, which include fever, rash and joint pain.""This case isn't a cause for alarm - Zika can't spread directly between people, and as of Jan. 14 there have been no reports of anyone acquiring the illness while in the United States, according to the CDC.However, one species of the mosquito group known to carry Zika, the Aedes genus, is common across North America. This bug, called the Asian tiger mosquito, carries viruses related to Zika, such as chikungunya and dengue, and is especially common in U.S. states that border the Gulf of Mexico, as shown by a species distribution map created by the CDC.As yet, there is no vaccine against Zika and no cure for the infection. But Fauci and Morens wrote that they are skeptical about the benefit of pursuing a vaccine to halt Zika's spread, suggesting that vaccines are an inefficient solution to epidemics that appear seemingly out of nowhere. Vaccinating entire populations could be prohibitively expensive, the authors added.The more promising course, they wrote, would include implementing public health strategies that respond more quickly to contain infections before they reach epidemic proportions, and developing broad-spectrum antivirals, rather than following the more traditional treatment approach of ""one bug, one drug.""A global effortPerhaps the most unusual thing about Zika is that ""it's not so unusual anymore,"" said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an infectious disease specialist with Northwell Health in New York, who was not involved in writing the new editorial. ""These exotic infections like Zika, dengue, West Nile and chikungunya are becoming very well-known and familiar,"" he told Live Science.Hirsch explained that global warming is likely allowing the mosquitos that carry Zika to range farther north. And as human populations grow and live closer to each other, the risk of disease transmission and the possibility of emerging epidemics increases, Hirsch said.Perhaps the key to beating these viruses lies in better-coordinated global efforts, Hirsch added. If infections in remote locations can reach the United States' doorstep in a matter of months or weeks, then the global health care community must pay closer attention and respond more immediately to health crises as they develop, no matter where in the world they are, he said.""We need to understand that monitoring the health of people around the planet is a way to keep our local community safe,"" Hirsch said. on Twitter and Google+.

"Congressional negotiators agreed Wednesday to a package that posts $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne illness that can cause serious birth defect in infants born to infected mothers.Leading Democrats are blasting the deal spearheaded by Republicans, which pays for $750 million of the funding through existing federal accounts.President Obama had requested $1.9 billion in emergency spending to speed the pursuit of a vaccine and better diagnostic test for Zika, while bolstering local mosquito control efforts.He submitted his request in February, but GOP leaders were skeptical about the amount, how it would be spent and why the administration hadn't searched for spending offsets elsewhere in the massive federal budget.Instead of granting his request, congressional negotiators melded a House plan that would take $622 million from the lingering fight against Ebola in West Africa and other health accounts with a Senate plan that posts $1.1 billion without paying for it with cuts elsewhere in the federal budget.The resulting package provides funding for community centers but not Planned Parenthood, much to the consternation of Democrats who had backed Mr. Obama's full request.

Their proposal would be comical except this a public health emergency and it deserves urgency,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said.The Zika outbreak is centered in South America, particularly in Brazil, where doctors have noted a link between the disease and an uptick in babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly.The Centers for Disease Control has recorded more than 750 travel-related cases of Zika in the 50 states and D.C., a handful of them through sexual transmission, though experts say the virus could puncture the mainland further once summer ramps up and Aedes mosquitoes flourish.So far, three babies have been born in the U.S. with birth defects that resulted from Zika infections, according to the CDC. ","washingtontimes","right","16974","zika",332
"(REUTERS) The United States Olympic Committee told U.S. sports federations that athletes and staff concerned for their health over the Zika virus should consider not going to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games in August.The message was delivered in a conference call involving USOC officials and leaders of U.S. sport federations in late January, according to two people who participated in the call.Federations were told that no one should go to Brazil ""if they don't feel comfortable going. Bottom line,"" said Donald Anthony, president and board chairman of USA Fencing.The USOC's briefing to sport federations is the latest sign that Olympics officials are taking the Zika threat to the games in Rio de Janeiro seriously, and acknowledging that at least some athletes and support staff could face a tough decision over whether to attend.The United States won most medals at the last Olympics in London in 2012, so any disruption to its presence would be important for the Rio games.Global health authorities suspect the mosquito-borne Zika virus has caused a spike in Brazil of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by an abnormally small head. As a result, the World Health Organization declared an international health emergency Feb. 1, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is advising pregnant women or those considering becoming pregnant to avoid travel to places with Zika outbreaks.Read the rest of the story at Reuters.com.","breitbart","right","16839","zika",235
"Experts and the World Health Organization is warning that the Zika virus, native to Africa but spreading rapidly in Latin America, has ""explosive pandemic potential"" and may ultimately affect up to four million people, significantly eclipsing the number of cases in the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak.""The level of alarm is extremely high, as is the level of uncertainty. Questions abound,"" the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), said in a briefing Wednesday. ""We need to get some answers quickly."" She noted that the greatest danger for its spread is that humans contract the virus through mosquito bites. ""The mosquito is ubiquitous,"" she warned, ""You don't need to travel to get the disease.""Marcos Espinal, head of communicable diseases and health analysis for the WHO's regional satellite, the Pan American Health Organization, told reporters, ""we can expect 3 to 4 million cases of Zika virus disease."" Experts base their estimates on the populations that live in habitats favorable to the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is known to spread Zika, Dengue fever, Chikungunya, and Yellow fever. The Washington Post notes that some models have estimated that up to 200 million people in the United States alone live in Aedes aegypti territory.The WHO's warnings follow the publication of a paper by medical experts Daniel R. Lucey and Lawrence O. Gostin, who argue the virus has ""explosive pandemic potential"" and, should the WHO and other international medical organizations respond to it as slowly as they did to the Ebola outbreak, millions of lives could be in danger. The doctors warn that, as early onset of Zika is often asymptomatic, the disease could be spreading far more rapidly than doctors can measure.A cure for Zika could be as much as ten years away, experts contend, because the virus does minimal damage to healthy adults. ""When Zika infection was seen as usually asymptomatic and self-limited, researchers had little incentive to develop reliable countermeasures,"" Lucey and Gostin explain, noting that the urgency from the international community today is based on the increasingly established links between Zika and numerous ""fetal complications,"" most prominently microcephaly.Microcephaly is a condition in which a child is born with a skull too small for his or her brain, resulting in significant mental damage. Many die shortly after birth, but others live with severe mental injury.Brazil has been hardest hit by the wave of microcephaly cases. The number of cases of microcephaly linked to Zika virus have surpassed 4,000 in South America's largest nation, with a diagnostic rate of 200 cases a week. In the Southern Hemisphere summer, officials are worrying that cities may be the hardest hit. The city of Recife, for example, is predicting that up to 100,000 people within its borders came into contact with the Zika virus ""in the first semester of 2015."" Of those, it is unclear how many may have been affected.Experts fear the number of cases of damaged infants will skyrocket, as more and more Zika diagnoses in pregnant women come in. Colombia has diagnosed 890 pregnant women with the virus, with little ability to predict whether the child will be healthy before it is born.The United States, meanwhile, has confirmed 31 cases within the 50 states, though all have contracted the disease from affected areas in Latin America. Puerto Rico has diagnosed 19 cases.""The only proven tools we have in hand is mosquito abatement and public health recommendations,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, tells ABC News. While WHO and other organizations will work on research to find a cure, governments should focus on eradicating Aedes aegypti populations.The Pentagon announced Wednesday it would begin contributing to efforts to contain the virus, working with the Department of Health and Human Services.","breitbart","right","16828","zika",626
"Co-authored by Simon WrightOn February 1st, the World Health Organization declared the spread of the Zika virus a public health emergency. The declaration was the WHO's highest level of warning--so dire, in fact, that it has only been declared three times in the organization's history. We believe that, as with Ebola, the lesson we learn must be the importance of robust universal primary health care services.Spreading rapidly throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, the Zika virus is now emerging in other parts of the globe. Experts anticipate the virus' impact may be even greater than the Ebola epidemic. As many as four million people in Latin America and the Caribbean alone are at risk of infection by the end of the year.Media coverage of Zika in North America and Europe is already prolific, with the declaration spawning primers on the virus and precautions against mosquito bites, assessments of the adequacy of responses from the WHO and individual governments, updates on vaccine and gene technology, and a plethora of travel advisories--including speculation about the fate of the Olympics in Brazil. Each of these stories is well-meaning, but it's time to shift the lens and focus on those worst-affected. The individuals living in affected communities cannot fly away to other locales. They have to deal with the ripple effects of the responses from the WHO and their governments, whether they were effective or not--and no, they cannot simply stop having babies at the behest of policymakers. The Zika outbreak brings into sharp relief just how important primary health care systems are in identifying, preventing, treating, and managing infectious diseases. A young woman living in Recife will not consult WHO bulletins to understand Zika's implications. She will rely first on the same community health workers or primary care nurses and physicians she has always trusted for care. First, for information about the virus and how to prevent its spread. She may want to also understand her contraceptive options so that she may delay pregnancy. If she is lucky, the care she receives will ensure access to affordable, effective quality contraceptives and other reproductive health-related services. If she is a new mother whose baby has been diagnosed with microcephaly, she will turn once again to these same networks for advice about long-term treatment and care for her infant. A strong health system therefore depends on a supportive primary health care system that is organized around the health needs of individual people, serving as the first point of contact for care and making referrals as necessary. Putting ourselves in her shoes forces us to see that the foundation--and sustainability--of the crisis response depends on the quality of care she receives at that primary entry point. Like Ebola, Zika was not a priority for donors or global health projects. It was not predictable that this would develop in the way it has. But it is predictable that primary care has to cope with whatever problems arise in a community. We need to break out of traditional health sector silos and call for cross-cutting and comprehensive measures that reinforce the importance of integrated primary health care.Unfortunately, despite the wide-ranging functions of primary health care--immunizations, family planning, diagnostics, antenatal care, maternity services, rehabilitation, counseling, and referrals--it is often underfunded and deprioritized, forcing people to use whatever cash they have for low-quality private services. The volatile Zika outbreak should remind health advocates and policymakers alike that investments in strong comprehensive primary health care systems is the very best precaution for such emergencies. This year in Japan, the G7 will be discussing Universal Health Coverage needs, which is a step in the right direction. In the coming months, we will continue to hear medical experts offering guidelines and weighing in on the global impact of the disease; but to the women directly affected by Zika, the medical advice that will matter the most will be from the local health professionals she already knows. Suzanne Ehlers is President and CEO of PAI. She leads the organization in its mission to ensure that every person has access to quality, effective and affordable reproductive health care.

"On Monday, the World Health Organization declared the spread of the Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern.  Unlike other viruses spread through the bite of the Aedes mosquito -- such as dengue, yellow fever, or chikungunya -- the Zika virus often went unnoticed and was considered a mild tropical disease with most virus carriers being symptomless.  Yet Brazil recently found itself in the throes of an unprecedented Zika outbreak -- with more than a million people infected within the past year -- and an unusually high number of babies born with microcephaly. There is growing international consensus, although not yet definitive proof, that the virus has potentially catastrophic implications for infected pregnant women and their unborn children, as well as possible links to other serious neurological conditions. Experts believe that environmental destruction caused the Zika virus to infect humans and is fueling its dramatic spread through the Americas.There is no vaccine or cure for Zika, and a health sector response will simply not be sufficient to stop its spread.   This means that fear of infection is mounting among people living in the most vulnerable communities across Latin America, where cased have been reported in 25 countries and territories.Some countries have responded to the threat of Zika by issuing their own recommendations including advising women not to get pregnant, introducing travel warnings and encouraging individuals to cover up and use more mosquito repellent. Unfortunately, these recommendations are mostly focused on individual action: what a woman should do to protect herself and her unborn baby. They assume that all women have full control over their reproductive health and choices, and that they have the resources and knowledge to act. The WHO Emergency Committee highlighted the importance of aggressive measures to reduce infection rates. To stop the spread of Zika, governments will need to do much more.  At a minimum, vastly expanded mosquito control measures are urgently needed. These include residual spraying of houses, a focus on eliminating breeding sites, minimizing urban stagnant water, community engagement to raise awareness, and mapping of the Aedes mosquito to better target efforts.     As is true of any disease outbreak, as we saw with Ebola and learned from years working on HIV, health and development are intimately related.  The poor, those who live in informal settlements, marginalized populations, and groups that lack power and resources are often the hardest hit. With this in mind, UNDP has always advocated for multi-sectoral responses to health, recognizing that vulnerability to poor health is often shaped by inequality, bad policies in agriculture, environment, trade, housing or education, and a lack of a coordinated responses during outbreaks. In declaring Zika a global public health emergency, the WHO has acknowledged that robust and concerted cross-sectoral global action is needed to stop this virus.  UNDP has much to contribute, with our broad experience in supporting the implementation of large-scale health, environment, and development programmes. Through our partnership with the Global Fund, UNDP manages malaria programmes in nine countries. One of the ways UNDP can provide support to the Zika efforts is sharing expertise on multi-dimensional mosquito control responses. In addition, UNDP has strong partnerships with key health agencies, regional organizations, and civil society to help accelerate efforts. Zika is a wake-up call for the way we address health and development in the Sustainable Development Goal era: If we do not take climate change and the impact that environmental degradation has on disease vectors seriously and if we do not address gender inequality and improve the daily conditions for people living in poverty, public health at-large will be increasingly at risk.","huffingtonpost","left","16834","zika",620
"Texas public health officials confirmed the birth of a baby boy in Harris County with Zika-linked microcephaly, the congenital birth defect where a newborn's head and brain are only partially developed. This marks the first live birth of a baby with Zika-related microcephaly in the Lone Star State.""Microcephaly is one of the worst tragedies related to Zika virus infection. We are sad to report that we now have our first case of Zika-associated microcephaly and our hearts go out to the family, said Umair A. Shah, MD. MPH, executive director of Harris County Public Health (HCPH).The birth defect stunts the developing baby's brain and head from growing fully. With its link to microcephaly, Zika poses a serious threat to unborn children. ""It's heartbreaking. This underscores the damage Zika can have on unborn babies,"" said Dr. John Hellerstedt, Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) commissioner. ""Our state's work against Zika has never been more vital.""Texas DSHS educates women and families about how to protect themselves from Zika through its Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program. They work closely with other state agencies to emphasize precaution at schools, daycare centers, and in women's health programs.Houston's KHOU 11 (CBS) reported the mother is from Colombia where she likely was infected and the baby contracted the infection in utero. She came to Harris County during her third trimester of pregnancy. Neither baby nor mother are contageous and there is no additional risk in Texas. However, when she was tested, the results came back as inconclusive. Doctors diagnosed the son with microcephaly at birth.""Since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed that Zika is linked to birth defects, we continue to encourage individuals traveling to areas where the virus has been identified to take steps to prevent Zika infection, and to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they develop Zika symptoms even upon return to the United States,"" added Shah.""Our central goal is protecting unborn babies from Zika,"" stated Hellerstedt. ""We are on alert for local transmission and will act fast to identify actual risk and continue to do everything we can to protect Texans.""To date, Texas reported 63 cases of Zika-related disease. Of those, 62 were travelers infected abroad and diagnosed after they returned home; two of those travelers were pregnant women. Recently, state officials tested 10 pregnant Dallas women exhibiting Zika symptoms.Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 320 pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika infection. They account for nine infants born with Zika-related birth defects such as microcephaly or other brain damage. Six pregnancies ended in miscarriage and/or stillbirth. An additional 279 reflected pregnant women in U.S. territories where no babies have been reported born with Zika-linked birth defects but one pregnancy ended poorly where the baby did not survive.Zika symptoms, for most, are mild and include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and joint-pain, lasting several days to a week. Although hospitalization and death is rare, the virus has been linked to Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune system disorder that causes severe joint and muscle pain. Zika can also be transmitted sexually. The first U.S. cases of sexually transmitted Zika through heterosexual and homosexual contact happened in Texas.While public health officials previously expressed concerns over the possibility of ""transmission cycles"" where local Texas mosquitoes could contract and spread Zika after biting an infected patient, they now anticipate small pockets of Zika in limited clusters and not widespread transmission across large geographic areas of the state. They base their assessment on the state's past experience with Dengue fever, a similar virus spread by the same indigenous Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and on the prevalent precautionary use of window screens, air conditioning, EPA-approved insect repellent, protective clothing, and other mosquito control efforts statewide.There is no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat Zika virus infection. ""We know that prevention is key to reducing the risk of Zika virus infection,"" said Shah., a member of the original Breitbart Texas Team, on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16997","zika",684

"The world may be fixated on Zika virus, but in Angola, there's a more pressing infectious disease spread by mosquitos to worry about. A yellow fever outbreak that began in the capital city of Luanda in December has infected 450 people and killed 178, according to the World Health Organization. The mosquito-transmitted disease has since spread to six of Angola's 18 provinces. ""Yellow fever, in and of itself, is a bad disease,"" Dr. Gregory Poland, head of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group and editor-in-chief of the journal Vaccine, told HuffPost. According to the WHO, the disease affects between 84,000 and 170,000 people each year, killing about 60,000 annually.In stage one of the disease, symptoms of yellow fever include fever, muscle pain, backache, headache, shivers, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting. If a patient moves into stage two, he or she can develop jaundice, abdominal pain and bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach, and bloody vomit or feces. If left untreated, survival rates are poor for second-stage yellow fever, which affects about 15 percent of people who become infected. Fifty percent of severely affected people who don't receive treatment die. Unfortunately, it's notoriously difficult to diagnose yellow fever, the early symptoms of which are similar to other viruses including dengue, Zika, West Nile, severe malaria and viral hepatitis. There's no cure for yellow fever, and treatment is limited to supportive care, such as blood pressure management, administering fluids and in some cases, dialysis to manage kidney failure.However, there is a highly effective yellow fever vaccine that's been around for roughly 80 years. The microbiologist who developed it won a Nobel Prize for his efforts in 1951. Unfortunately for poor countries like Angola, limited infrastructure makes implementing routine vaccination programs tricky, if not impossible. Those structural challenges are compounded by the fact that there are only four facilities worldwide -- one private and three government-owned -- that produce yellow fever vaccine, according to NPR.""Yellow fever is a forgotten disease,"" Dr. William Perea, coordinator of the control of epidemic diseases for the WHO told NPR. ""I mean, who cares about yellow fever? Basically, the markets [for yellow fever vaccine] are poor countries in Africa and some countries in Latin America.""South America and Africa, particularly jungle areas, are at higher risk. Despite similar climates in Asia, which includes tropical regions and plenty of mosquitos, yellow fever has never been reported there -- a phenomenon that scientists don't know how to explain.Yellow fever is thought to have originated Africa, and traveled to the Americas on slave ships. Monkeys can also be infected by the virus, and they continue to give scientists a hint that the disease is on the move. ""In Africa and in some parts of South America, the first clue that you might have yellow fever is that monkeys in the jungle start dying,"" said Dr. Anna Durbin, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.If health experts suspect that yellow fever is present in a community, they'll do a mass vaccination program to control the outbreak. But since large outbreaks aren't common, there's a limited stockpile of yellow fever vaccine. In Angola, the limited stockpile is a major problem, at least for now. The WHO sent its entire yellow fever vaccine arsenal -- 6 million doses in total, according to STAT -- to battle Angola's outbreak. It's not nearly enough for country of almost 20 million people. ""We've seen this situation before, unfortunately, where the outbreak or the number of people that need to be vaccinated is larger than the number of doses of vaccine that we have,"" Durbin said.Economics could play a part in the recurring vaccine shortage. ""The demand is big in countries that can't afford the vaccine,"" Poland said.Durbin thinks that the vaccines' manufactures will likely be able to ramp up yellow fever vaccine production in the face of the outbreak. ""It's a live vaccine, which means they can produce it fairly quickly,"" she said. ""I do think that they'll have enough vaccine to interrupt the outbreak.""Still, Durbin felt it could take a few weeks to a couple of months to vaccinate everyone, depending on whether or not some community members were previously immunized against yellow fever. (According to WHO, a single dose of yellow fever vaccine is sufficient for life-long immunity. The U.S. government recommends an additional booster shot for some travelers.) Although the U.S. suffered a yellow fever epidemic during the 19th century, including outbreaks in Boston, Baltimore, New York City and Philadelphia, the U.S. isn't considered a yellow fever transmission country today thanks to the elimination of mosquito breeding grounds and use of pesticides.Still, the U.S. has a thriving mosquito population. ""In the Northeast and the Southwest the mosquito vector is already in place,"" Poland said. ""Are we going to see it here? It's an open question.""Chances of yellow fever affecting Americans are lowered when the disease is addressed when and where it crops up abroad. Durbin is optimistic this will be the case with Angola. ""I think the yellow fever outbreak [in Angola] is going to be handled relatively easily, because we have a vaccine that we can deploy,"" she said. ""There may be a shortage, it may take a little while to get enough doses, but I know we have an effective vaccine that can work.""Infectious disease outbreaks and flareups are common. ""If you look at the U.S. since the '80s, we've had an outbreak or concern of new agents every year or three years,"" Poland said, listing Lyme disease, West Nile, Zika, Ebola, MERS and SARS as a few examples.

"By Susan Blumenthal, MD, Ladan Fakory, and Alec KingstonThe spread and impact of the Zika virus is yet another wake-up call for the global community, following the Ebola crisis, that infectious diseases pose significant threats to human health and international security. Since 2007, the disease has been reported in more than 64 countries and territories worldwide. On February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the Zika outbreak was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A few days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a ""level 1"" activation for its emergency command center (recently raised to ""level 2""), and a week later, the Obama Administration requested $1.86 billion from Congress to fight this public health emergency. On April 7, 2016, the WHO reported that there is scientific consensus that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS). Then on April 13, 2016, the CDC confirmed that there is no longer any doubt that Zika is a cause of microcephaly and other neurological damage in infants. Experts estimated that 2.17 billion people are living in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where Zika-carrying mosquitoes can thrive. According to the WHO, as many as 4 million Zika cases are predicted in the Western hemisphere alone by the end of 2016. Since it was first reported in Brazil in 2015, Zika has spread rapidly with most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean reporting local transmission of the virus. There is increasing concern that the disease could affect people living in the United States. As of May 4, 2016, there have been 472 Zika cases reported in 44 U.S. states, and 661 cases reported in 3 U.S. territories, with 631 cases in Puerto Rico alone. The virus is a particular threat to Puerto Rico, where it is estimated that as many as 25% of people living there may become infected with Zika. On April 29, 2016, experts confirmed that the first Zika-related death in the United States occurred in February for a 70-year old Puerto Rican man due to a bleeding disorder, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In ITP, the body's immune system attacks the blood cells called platelets that allow clotting. This is the 9th know case of this type of bleeding associated with Zika.The Zika pandemic underscores the importance of prevention and public health preparedness in mitigating the spread of disease and promoting global health. Since 1976, as many as three new infectious diseases have emerged each year: HIV/AIDS, SARS, H1N1, Ebola, MERS, and West Nile encephalitis are just some of the most serious and headline grabbing ones. As of 2014, more than 346 infectious diseases were linked to 16% of all human deaths worldwide annually. The devastating impact of infectious disease outbreaks on societies is not a new phenomenon. Communities and countries have experienced the burden of infectious illnesses for millennia. While these diseases can cause debilitating health complications including death, emerging illnesses can also create public panic leading to significant socio-economic impacts affecting education, business, and travel. For example, the World Bank estimates that in 2016, the Zika virus will pose an economic burden of $3.5 billion on Latin America and the Caribbean alone. With more than 2 million people crossing international borders every day and the world more interconnected than ever before, the disruptive potential of infectious disease epidemics has reached unprecedented levels. Now is the time to commit the necessary funding to ensure pandemic preparedness and response. If the necessary investments are made, advances from research hold the promise of effective treatments and vaccines for infectious diseases like Zika and Ebola in the future. However, until that time, coordination, collaboration, and communication across communities and countries are the cornerstones of effective preparedness to prevent disease spread.History of the Zika VirusZika, a flavivirus, was first discovered in 1947 in rhesus monkeys in Uganda. The virus quickly jumped to humans, with the first cases in people recorded in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania. Outbreaks were reported in Yap in 2007; French Polynesia in 2013; and Brazil, Colombia, and Cabo Verde in 2015. Genetic sequencing reveals that the Zika virus in South America is similar to that found in French Polynesia, suggesting it was introduced to Brazil from an infected traveler from French Polynesia. However, the sequences are not identical which can have important effects on human disease. As of April 14, 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 64 countries have shown active transmission of the Zika virus since 2007, with more than 1 million cases in Brazil alone. As the virus rapidly spreads around the world, as many as 4 million Zika cases are predicted in the Western hemisphere by the end of 2016. With the epidemic moving northward and the anticipated hotter summer weather, U.S. officials are concerned about Zika-infected mosquitoes infecting people in Florida, other Gulf coast states, Hawaii, as well as the possible spread northward to Washington DC, New York, and Chicago during the warmer summer months. As of May 4, 2016, there have been 472 Zika cases reported in 44 U.S. states. Zika, a single-stranded RNA arbovirus, is primarily spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same species that transmits other infectious diseases, including chikungunya and dengue. Zika can also be spread by the Aedes albopictus mosquito, known as the Asian tiger mosquito. If spread of the virus occurs in America, Aedes aegypti would most likely be the primary vector in urban areas and southern U.S. states along the Gulf Coast, whereas Aedes albopictus could play a larger role in transmission in the U.S. due to its wide distribution as far as New England and the lower Great Lakes. With international trade and travel, humans are contributing to the spread of these mosquitoes to new habitats. The global transportation of cargo and travel by people are partially responsible for introducing these mosquitoes to new continents. In addition,  environmental changes including urbanization, dam construction, deforestation, and rising temperatures linked to climate change have increased the number of locations around the world in which these mosquitoes can thrive. Recent case reports suggest that the Zika virus is being spread through sexual intercourse and blood transfusions. There have been several cases of heterosexual transmission but two weeks ago, the first case of sexual transmission in a gay couple was documented. The CDC continues to investigate these cases and issues updated recommendations for prevention. Efforts to stop the spread of the Zika epidemic will need to effectively address every method of viral transmission.Zika Symptoms and Disease Course Most people who are infected with Zika do not experience any symptoms and are unaware that they are infected. However, an estimated 20% of people will have symptoms, including fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, headaches, and muscle/joint pain, lasting from 2-7 days. It is not yet known how long the virus remains in a human's blood or semen. One case reported in the United States revealed that the virus was present in the patient's blood 10 weeks after infection. Until the most recent outbreak, Zika was believed to be a relatively benign disease. However, its recent emergence in Brazil, with reports of severe clinical neurological complications in infants and adults, has made this disease a global emergency. Concerns about Zika have been amplified as hundreds of thousands of people plan to travel to Brazil for the upcoming Summer Olympic Games. Over the past year, health officials have reported a strong link between Zika-infected pregnant mothers and higher than average rates of microcephaly in their babies, a rare birth defect where babies are born with underdeveloped heads. Recently, the CDC confirmed there is now scientific consensus that Zika causes microcephaly. In most cases, the infant's brain has not developed properly, leading to complications, including seizures, developmental delays, and difficulty with coordination, balance, hearing, vision, and possibly death. One study has associated Zika with even more severe birth defects than previously reported as a stillborn baby was found to have almost complete loss of brain tissue. In Brazil alone, more than 4,949 babies were born with microcephaly since 2015, which represents a 20-fold increase from 2010-14. Studies have shown that Zika can spread through a pregnant woman's amniotic fluid and into the brain of her fetus, attacking the neural cells and stunting the infant's brain development. In January 2016, a case of microcephaly in an infant whose mother had lived in Brazil was reported in Hawaii, marking the first U.S. case of brain damage in an infant linked to the Zika virus. Alarmingly, a case in the U.S. revealed that early ultrasounds may miss the fetal damage caused by the Zika virus and that fetal MRIs may be necessary to detect this complication. Researchers are reporting varying rates of the incidence of microcephaly in infants of babies born to Zika infected mothers. An examination of the pregnancies of 88 women in Rio de Janeiro, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, revealed ""serious and frequent problems in fetal and central nervous system development"" in 29 percent of women who had experienced Zika symptoms during their pregnancy and had received prenatal imaging. In a retrospective study of the association between Zika virus and microcephaly in French Polynesia during the period of 2013-15, the risk of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection was 95 cases (34-191) per 10,000 women infected in the first trimester. The differences in rates are large across these studies. Prospective controlled studies are now underway to better determine the incidence of microcephaly in the babies of Zika-infected women. The nine month length of a term pregnancy means that it will take time to get the data needed on the actual risk from exposure to the virus, and also because the risk may vary significantly with each successive week of pregnancy. These devastating cases of microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in infants underscore the urgency to fight the Zika outbreak with sufficient resources now!Zika infection has also been linked to Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a rare condition in which a person's own immune system attacks and damages their peripheral nervous system, sometimes causing life-threatening or permanent muscle weakness or paralysis. Scientists reported the first GBS case linked to the Zika virus in 2014 in French Polynesia. French scientists have been investigating this particular outbreak and confirmed the link between GBS and Zika with additional cases of this neurological complication recently reported in in Brazil. On April 7, 2016, WHO confirmed that there was a link between Zika and GBS but CDC has not yet done so. Another brain disorder has been associated with Zika infections in adults called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), an autoimmune syndrome that affects the brain and spinal cord. ADEM generally occurs in the aftermath of an infection lasting about 6 months, causing significant swelling in the brain and spinal cord that results in weakness, numbness and loss of balance and vision, symptoms similar to multiple sclerosis. This illness adds to the growing evidence of serious neurological damage caused by the Zika virus.Pandemic Preparedness: A Roadmap of Recommendations Coordinated pandemic preparedness and response efforts across communities and countries are critical to addressing and controlling Zika and other emerging infectious illness threats in the future. This work should build on decades of research on other flaviviruses including dengue and yellow fever. Fortunately, WHO acted swiftly to declare Zika a public health emergency -- something the organization has done just three times since 2007. The U.S. government responded rapidly as well but additional resources and actions will be needed to contain the spread of this disease. Listed below are a series of recommendations for pandemic preparedness to help prevent and mitigate the impact of the Zika virus as well as other emerging infectious diseases now and in the years ahead: 1. Coordinate Global Health Systems Infrastructure, Personnel, and ResourcesIncreased pandemic preparedness to help prevent and contain infectious disease outbreaks, if they should occur, is essential to protecting global health security. A Global Health Security Agenda, endorsed by the G-7, was launched in February 2014 to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks before they become epidemics. The delayed, but ultimately successful response to the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa to date was in part due to the appointment of an Ebola Coordinator at the White House, who worked across U.S. government agencies and with other nations. Whether Ebola, Zika, or another emerging disease threat, countries must commit the funds, appoint coordinators, and develop a permanent emergency preparedness infrastructure to effectively respond to the Zika epidemic as well as to address the next outbreak of an infectious disease that will invariably occur. The establishment of a permanent ""Pandemic Preparedness Coordinator"" at the White House who is an experienced manager would be an important step forward to ensuring rapid and successful response to emerging diseases in the future. This person would work across the U.S. government agencies and with the private sector, other governments, and international organizations.The role of the civil society, local experts, and affected populations must be reinforced at all levels. Their involvement in planning and implementation is essential during the management of crises as well as in developing response plans.On February 8, 2016, the Obama Administration requested $1.86 billion to fight the Zika epidemic. The Congress is currently debating this funding request. Given the urgency of Zika as a public health threat, on April 6, 2016, the Administration redirected $589 million in unspent funding to combat the Ebola virus to fight the Zika epidemic. Of this amount, $47 million goes to NIAID for Zika research. As of February 16, 2016, WHO committed $56 million, and two days later, the World Bank committed $150 million. This level of support is not sufficient to fight this pandemic! It is critical to mobilize the resources needed to fight this disease. Failure to do so would be a major public health and political mistake with potentially devastating health and economic consequences. By investing in research towards the discovery of a vaccine and antiviral treatments, human suffering and the long-term costs of caring for cases of people with microcephaly, GBS, and ADEM can be averted. Additionally, the results should pay dual dividends to help fight other infectious diseases as well.Toward this goal, the establishment of a ""Global Health Security Fund"" is needed with contributions from governments and the private sector worldwide. Such an entity would be helpful in securing funds for building the necessary international infrastructure, including emergency response teams of medical providers, lab technicians, and community health workers. This infrastructure support would help the international community get ahead of the curve in responding collectively to emerging infectious diseases now and in the future. On May 6, 2016, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced the establishment of the UN Zika Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund, which will provide a rapid, flexible, and accountable platform to support a coordinated a response to support the global Zika Strategic Response Framework and Joint Operations Plan in consultation with UN agencies, partners, and international public health experts. Donors will contribute to a central ""fund"" and an Advisory Committee will direct funds to priority activities and programs. This is an important step forward but this Fund should be established as a permanent entity for supporting the global response to all emerging infectious disease threats.The response to infectious diseases must be fought as if the battle against epidemics were wars against international enemies. This was the framework for America's response to Ebola overseas and in the U.S, and now Brazil's strategy for addressing Zika includes military personnel and public officials who coordinate and mobilize supplies, conduct surveillance activities, build hospitals, oversee community efforts and establish emergency response operations centers. On April 1, 2016, the CDC convened, a Zika Action Plan Summit, which brought together local, state, and federal health officials as well as maternal health and mosquito eradication experts. The Summit was a forum for sharing best practices which attendees could take home and implement in their communities. Additionally, on April 19-22, 2016, the National Association of County & City Health Officials (NACCHO) convened public health experts to address pandemic preparedness, including how to respond to the Zika threat at the community level.2. Increased Surveillance and Early Detection In order to effectively combat the Zika virus, more effective methods for surveillance of bothinfected people and mosquitoes are urgently needed. The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are aggressive daytime biters that have adapted to breed in both urban and rural areas wherever rain collects and water is stored. Their laid eggs can survive for more than a year even in dry conditions, and the eggs' stickiness allows them to adhere to an array of surfaces, such as tires. These features make Aedes aegypti very difficult to control and track.Training community members and health workers to observe and report on Zika, and developing integrated systems for collecting and analyzing surveillance data are important. Mechanisms, such as syndromic surveillance, the meaningful use of electronic health records to achieve epidemiological insights, increased communication between hospitals and local and state health departments in the U.S. and around the world, accurate reporting of cases to public health departments, and a global hub of information provided by WHO tracking cases, are needed. Countries must be transparent in reporting Zika cases. Mobile phone technologies can help to improve surveillance by tracking disease outbreaks and sending information to a central global repository of tracking information.Early detection--the development of a rapid, accurate diagnostic test -- is an urgent priority in preventing further transmission of the virus and providing timely clinical care. Unfortunately, the fact that dengue and chikungunya result in similar clinical pictures and epidemic in the Americas confounds the clinical diagnosis of Zika. Because Zika is closely related to these diseases, serologic samples may often cross-react in tests for these other viruses. The presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies that bind to the Zika virus could be the result of past infections with any of the other flaviviruses or from prior immunization with a flavivirus vaccine. In many Latin American cities, dengue seroprevalence in adults may exceed 90%, thus confounding the diagnosis of Zika. Gene-detection tests, such as the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay, can reliably distinguish the three viruses, but Zika-specific tests are not yet widely available. Research teams from Texas have recently succeeded in producing a rapid detection test for the Zika virus that can determine its presence within several hours as well as differentiate it from other infectious diseases carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, including chikungunya and dengue. On March 18, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for a 3-in-1 real time PCR laboratory assay for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue. On March 30, 2016, the FDA also said that it would allow the use of an experimental test to check for the presence of the Zika virus in blood donations. This action means that Puerto Rico, which had ceased local blood donations and imported nearly 6,000 units of red blood from the continental United States, will be able to resume collecting donations from residents. And this new tool will also help blood banks in other parts of the country as well. On Friday, April 29, 2016, FDA provided emergency authorization to sell the first commercially developed Zika blood test in the U.S., which should expand testing capacity by doctors and accelerate the diagnosis of the virus.Last week, a paper-based rapid test for detecting the Zika virus was introduced by a consortium of research groups including MIT, Harvard, and Boston University. The test consists of a paper covered with yellow dots that turns purple in the presence of the RNA of the virus. The test is relatively fast and simple and can be performed in most laboratories with results in about 2-3 hours. It is estimated that the test will cost less than $1 and that results will be delivered faster than PCR assays available today. Scientists freeze dried on paper the cell's normal ""machinery including proteins, nucleic acids and ribosomes. The color change on the paper can be read by the eye or by using an extra-sensitive scanner that may eventually be able to measure viral loads in the blood sample. The test has worked on Zika-infected monkey blood, which was used because human samples were difficult to obtain when the research was being conducted. The scientists now want to evaluate the test's effectiveness on humans living in areas of the Zika outbreak in South America. More work is needed to develop and evaluate these kinds of rapid diagnostics that can be used in the field to accurately determine whether people have been infected with flaviviruses including Zika, chikungunya and dengue.On May 10, 2016, the CDC issued new urine-based testing guidance for detecting the Zika virus. This test may prove to be more effective than a blood-based test since virus particles can be detected for longer time periods and at higher levels in urine than in blood. In testing 66 people in Florida for Zika using blood and urine samples, twice as many urine samples resulted in correctly testing positive compared to blood samples. In addition, the urine tests detect the virus for two weeks after the onset of symptoms, compared to one week for blood tests. For now, the CDC guidelines recommend that patients with Zika symptoms be provided both blood and urine tests, since the blood test also detects the body's immune response to the virus.On April 19, 2016, a new global ""Zika zone"" map was launched by a consortium of researchers at major universities worldwide, including the University of Washington and Oxford University. The map calculates when and where the Zika virus is likely to spread based on detailed geographic and environmental conditions data. On April 27, 2016, NASA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) released a map that explores the potential spread of Zika in the U.S., applying factors, such as temperature, poverty levels, amount of rainfall, and travel to America from regions of the world affected by the virus. The goal of this project is to help target a ""search and destroy mission"" against the deadly Aedes mosquito. As many as 80% of Zika viral infections are believed to be asymptomatic. Furthermore, there are no antiviral treatments or vaccines currently available to treat or prevent acquisition of the disease. Until there are effective treatments for Zika, physicians and other health care providers should focus on symptomatic management, such as getting adequate rest, preventing dehydration by drinking fluids, taking acetaminophen to relieve fever and pain, and avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). People infected with Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus should be protected from further mosquito exposure during the first few days of illness to prevent other mosquitoes from becoming infected and reduce the risk of local transmission. Issues related to fetal infection are complex, and strategies are urgently needed to prevent transmission of the virus to infants.4. Effective Vector Control, Eradication, and Gene Drive Technology21st century effective vector control strategies must be developed and utilized to prevent the spread of mosquito borne diseases, including Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and malaria. There are 3,500 known species of mosquitoes with a few hundred types that bite humans; but, only three species are linked so far to the transmission of human diseases. The Aedes aegypti species transmit Zika, chikungunya, and dengue. Only female mosquitoes bite as they need the amino acids from blood to develop and lay eggs. Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, use nectar as a source of energy. Transmission occurs when female mosquitoes bite an infected human and then transfer the virus to the next person they bite through the mosquitoes' saliva. Some victories against mosquitoes have occurred, thanks to insecticide-treated bed nets and vaccines against viruses including yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis. In December 2015, the first vaccine for dengue was approved in Mexico. Nevertheless, mosquito borne diseases kill more than 725,000 people a year, mostly due to malaria. Climate change adds a further compounding factor. A 3.6 to 5.4 degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature can increase the number of people at risk of malaria by more than 100 million, according to the WHO. Warmer weather also speeds up the mosquito breeding cycle from about two weeks at 77degrees Fahrenheit to 7-8 days at 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The effects of warming temperatures means that mosquitoes carrying Zika can impact people in more regions around the world. Mosquito control efforts in the U.S. is handled by a patchwork of districts that are coordinated and funded locally. Some of these programs may not be connected to community or state health departments. Most of these programs are aimed at controlling ""nuisance"" mosquitos rather than disease spreading ones. Strategies being explored to eradicate human disease spreading mosquitoes include genetic modification, radiation, insecticides, and targeted bacteria. However, these approaches raise several issues: ethical concerns about killing off a species, and the effects on the rest of the ecosystem, including on human health. For example, DDT is no longer recommended for malaria control since it is harmful to the environment as well as humans, with a suspected link to an increased risk for breast and other cancers. While DDT is a banned substance, some experts are advising that restrictions on its use be lifted given the Zika public health emergency. While insecticides have been used with success in many areas of the world, mosquitoes are emerging with resistance to these substances. A new generation of agents is urgently needed in the 21st century for vector control with minimal side effects for humans.In recent years, scientists are focusing on integrated vector management as well as genetic modification to eradicate mosquitoes. The CDC has instructed health departments to target killing the larvae and adult mosquitoes, indoors and outdoors - a ""four corners approach."" Since the Aedes aegypti mosquito has a flight range of only 150 yards, typical mosquito control efforts such as community insecticide spraying may be as effective as other vector control tactics, such as targeted spraying around individual homes and disposing of mosquito-breeding habitats like water containers. Genetic modification is being used by companies to create sterile male mosquitoes that seek out and mate with females. The offspring, in turn, do not survive to adulthood, thus decreasing the mosquito population and spread of mosquito-transmitted diseases. An Aedes Genome Working Group of leading U.S. mosquito scientists is working to create a state-of-the-art DNA map of the Aedes aegypti mosquito to aid in the fight against Zika using the insect's own genetic code. The goal of the group is to develop a new genetic combat strategy against the increasing threat posed by insect transmitted diseases. A new molecular based technology, CRISPR, a gene snipping tool, creates genetic changes which are then transmitted to a mosquito's offspring. Two approaches are being applied to reduce the threat of mosquitos: 1) modifying a gene so that mosquitos become unsuitable hosts for a pathogen that infects people; and 2) rendering insects extinct by giving their genes male only reproductive instructions. A concern about these approaches expressed by some scientists is the unpredictable ecological impact of a genetically modified species. Gene drive technology is new and promising, but safety concerns have yet to be adequately addressed. Another approach involves scientists transferring the natural bacteria called Wolbachia, found in 60% of all insect species, to the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Wolbachia was first discovered in a mosquito in 1924 in Boston. Instead of floating in the blood, the bacteria reside inside cells. Female mosquitos carry the Wolbachia bacteria in their eggs, thus infecting offspring. Research has shown that when Wolbachia is present, the mosquito's ability to transmit dengue is significantly reduced. The Eliminate Dengue Program, an international collaboration, uses this approach to block transmission of the virus to humans. In 2011, several hundreds of thousands of Wolbachia infected mosquitos were released in northern Australia. More than 5 years later, most of the mosquitos were found to still have the bacteria present. When these Wolbachia infected mosquitos are widely present, dengue cases have disappeared in that area. A large scale trial will begin in June in Indonesia to scientifically confirm the impact of Wolbachia infected mosquitos on the incidence and prevalence of dengue infection. Researchers are now testing whether this approach can reduce cases of Zika infection. Preliminary findings suggest that Wolbachia suppresses Zika in mosquitos, like it does dengue. More research is needed to evaluate whether this approach can stop human transmission of the Zika virus as well as other diseases carried by mosquitos including malaria, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Some scientists have expressed concerns that eliminating all mosquitoes would make little sense, since there are more than 3,500 species, fewer than 200 species bite humans, and only 3 species bear the primary responsibility for transmitting disease to people. Mosquitoes that do not bite humans serve as food for frogs, fish, birds, and bats and some may play a role in pollination of plants. Concerns about modifying mosquitos to prevent Zika transmission to humans have mobilized organizations to take action. The WHO is evaluating guidance concerning transgenic mosquitoes and transgenic bacteria. The FDA has indicated that it believes that genetically modified mosquitoes are ""not expected to have any direct impacts on human or animal health."" The agency is now soliciting public comment before releasing genetically modified mosquitoes in a field trial in Key West, Florida to evaluate whether using this approach can decrease the population of mosquitoes that carry Zika, chikungunya, and dengue in that state. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued several experimental permits to introduce Wolbachia bacteria to prevent mosquito reproduction. Clearly, new, innovative vector control methods are needed in the 21st century but more research will be required on the various types of proposed mosquito eradication methods and their effects on humans and on the ecosystem before implementation to prevent unintended health damaging consequences.5. Invest in ResearchThere is a dearth of knowledge about Zika and its clinical course with just 250 scientific journal articles published on the disease to date, compared to more than 19,000 scientific papers published on dengue. More research is needed on the basic pathogenesis of the virus and the immune response to it as well as increasing knowledge about the disease's effects on the brain in fetal development, children and adults. A key priority is a better understanding of the rate of perinatal transmission and the effects of the Zika virus during the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy on fetal development. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) posted a notice regarding its high-priority interest in Zika-related research. In addition, 30 leading scientific research institutions, journals, and funders have agreed to freely share all data and research on the Zika virus to accelerate the fight against its further spread. Governmental and non-governmental research institutions worldwide should share data in the spirit of transparency and collaboration that is needed to eradicate the epidemic. Additionally, recommendations are needed regarding perinatal testing with ultrasound, amniocentesis as well as other methods to assess whether congenital abnormalities are present.Some organizations have pledged funding to help fight Zika, but much of it is directed at addressing the need to contain the spread of the virus and provide care for the infected. For example, WHO has called for $56 million to help fund the Global Strategic Response Framework and Joint Operations Plan that will guide the international response to the Zika virus. However, only $6.4 million of that $56 million is allocated for research and the total amount of funding is certainly not sufficient to mount an effective eradication and control response. Similarly, the World Bank has pledged $150 million toward the international response to the Zika virus, which includes identifying at-risk individuals, improved public awareness programs, better medical care for pregnant women, but does not include research as a component of its funding plan. More resources are urgently needed to address unanswered questions about Zika, its clinical course, effects of its co-occurrence with other viruses, and to develop better detection methods as well as a vaccine and anti-viral medications. Scientists have begun a wide range of projects to investigate Zika. At the University of Wisconsin, researchers have injected the Zika virus into the fetus of a rhesus monkey to evaluate how the virus affects the development of the fetus' brain. Scientists are recording and publishing the raw data in real time on the laboratory's website so that all researchers interested in the microcephaly complication can have immediate access to the findings. This type of data sharing and transparency is essential to increase our understanding of Zika and facilitate the discovery of effective treatments as well as a vaccine. 6. Fast Track Vaccine and Anti-Viral DevelopmentPrior to this most recent Zika outbreak, there was little known about the Zika virus; thus, greater knowledge about the natural history of the illness will take time. As a result of emerging evidence linking Zika infection with serious medical complications, including GBS and ADEM, and microcephaly in infants, there is critical need to accelerate the scientific study of Zika including developing new biomedical countermeasures including vaccines and antiviral medications. Increased knowledge about why some people seem to be at greater risk for these complications is an important scientific priority. Since many parts of the world have not reported Zika outbreaks, people have no immunity, and therefore may be more susceptible to the health complications of the virus. Scientists have recently published a detailed picture of the Zika virus' physical structure, which will hopefully help them determine what properties of the virus cause the serious complications and can be targeted with anti-virals and vaccines in the future. Researchers estimate that a vaccine for the Zika virus is 3-10 years away. The NIH is currently pursuing several Zika vaccine approaches although this timeline may be accelerated if breakthroughs occur. Fortunately, vaccine platforms exist for other flaviviruses that can be used as a starting point for a Zika vaccine. A DNA-based vaccine, a strategy that was successfully used in developing a West Nile virus immunization, works by injecting a DNA fragment instead of a protein fragment to stimulate immunity. Trials of this vaccine type for Zika could begin in early 2017. The second vaccine approach uses a ""live attenuated"" weakened form of the virus that cannot cause disease but boost immunity building on a similar vaccine strategy used for the closely related dengue virus. Additionally, an investigational vaccine trial is underway using a genetically engineering version of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the same animal virus that successfully led to an investigational Ebola vaccine candidate. This vaccine strategy is in an early stage with plans to test its effectiveness in tissue culture and animal models. According to NIAID, it is feasible that an investigational vaccine would enter early stage clinical trials in 2016 to evaluate whether it is safe and stimulates an immune response in immunized volunteers.Given the frequency of emerging infectious diseases, a new model for vaccine development is required involving a partnership between the public and private sectors to accelerate the process and create strategies to boost immunity against various virus types. Vaccine platforms for flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and other arbovirus groups that can be quickly modified to express immunogenic antigens of newly emerging viruses should be further developed. The establishment of 21st century vaccine development infrastructure is critical as Zika and Ebola are the most recent of what may be many other emerging infectious disease threats in the years ahead.Another priority for research efforts must be the discovery of antivirals to help treat Zika, chikungunya and dengue as well as methods to prevent transmission of the virus from a mother to her fetus. These recent viral pandemics underscore that the ""one-bug-one-drug"" approach is inadequate; broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against whole classes of viruses are urgently needed.The development of biomedical countermeasures requires the coordination of a broad spectrum of government, NGO, and industry partners to be successful. There needs to be an international approach--a Global Pandemic Preparedness Treatment and Prevention Fund --that has three key components: 1) a focus on basic drug discovery and preclinical development; 2) clinical and advanced product development; and 3) procurement mechanisms and market commitments. No one agency or country can combat Zika or other emerging disease threats alone. An effective response will require a resilient governance structure to coordinate research and product development on a global scale. Strong, resilient health systems made all the difference in containing Ebola and preventing its spread. In the United States, the Ebola outbreak has underscored the importance of public health preparedness revitalization. Essential to the prevention and containment of future infectious disease outbreaks globally is a robust investment in building health systems infrastructure in the developing world where these illnesses often first emerge. But such pandemic preparedness is critical in the United States and other developed nations as well. Coordination of efforts and communication are cornerstones of public health preparedness. A ready reserve of well-trained health professionals around the world - an International Health Corps - with health expertise and medical supplies that can be mobilized to respond to a disease outbreak anywhere in the world -- are essential components of an effective response to illnesses like Zika and Ebola. In the United States, the USPHS Commissioned Corps serves a key role in such a response and its role should be further expanded in combating infectious disease outbreaks in the U.S. and globally. Community members and health workers have important roles to play and their contributions at the local level must be expanded.Governments and international organizations should conduct health education campaigns to raise public awareness about the Zika virus. These campaigns should emphasize helpful strategies for mitigating risks of contracting Zika (e.g., avoid mosquito bites, wear long-sleeved clothing, use insect repellents and insecticides, install window screens and bed-nets, keep windows closed, reduce standing bodies of water, and use air conditioning if available). It is important to have a trusted figure provide periodic updates to the public about the outbreak and steps they can take to prevent infection. More detailed and easy to access reporting of Zika cases should be included on the CDC Zika information page, including number of states with cases and incidence of microcephaly and GBS. Disaggregation of Zika cases by sex, race, and age should also be reported on the website. The World Health Organization (WHO) is encouraged to place their country Zika statistics in a prominent place on the homepage of their information resources about the virus.Additionally, travel advisories should be widely disseminated and updated regularly. The CDC has already issued a ""level 2"" travel health alert to practice enhanced precautions, suggesting that pregnant women postpone travel to any country with active Zika outbreaks, including the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on August 5-21, 2016 and the Paralympic Games on September 7-18, 2016. On March 11, 2016, the CDC updated the travel advisory stating that it was safe for pregnant women to travel to high-elevation cities above 6,500 feet in Zika-infected countries since the Aedes mosquitoes cannot live at those altitudes. CDC recommends that travelers returning from Zika-infected areas use condoms or practice abstinence to avoid infecting a partner through sexual transmission. The CDC recommends that females diagnosed with Zika wait at least eight weeks after the onset of symptoms before trying to get pregnant, and males diagnosed with Zika are advised to wait at least six months before having unprotected sex to prevent transmission of the virus to their partners. Public health experts should do outreach with the media to ensure accurate reporting about infectious disease outbreaks.9. Apply Social Media and IT Innovations in Pandemic PreparednessTechnologies including mobile phones and social media should be harnessed to track the spread of Zika and other infectious diseases as well as to disseminate education, clinical and prevention information to the public and health providers. A website and a mobile app that can be translated into various languages should be established to serve as an information hub for emergency global health preparedness. Mobile devices present an enormous untapped platform for instantaneously sharing information and aiding in disease surveillance, treatment and prevention approaches. These devices can also be used to facilitate research collaboration and training in real-time across communities and countries. Crowdsourcing can add to these benefits by creating space for citizens and community representatives to offer strategies and solutions. The role of community members and local efforts is critical to an effective response. However, it should also be noted that such platforms can also spread misinformation so monitoring may be necessary. 10. Address Religious, Ethical, and Legal Concerns Given the scope of the current Zika outbreak with reported cases of sexual transmission of the Zika virus and the serious complications to infants including microcephaly, issues have been raised about broadening the use and availability of contraceptives in affected countries. Health officials in some nations, including Brazil and El Salvador, have recommended that women avoid pregnancy due to the link between Zika and microcephaly. Many of the affected countries currently have relatively low contraceptive prevalence rates as well as restrictive abortion laws. The United States provides contraception through the Affordable Care Act of 2010 but controversy about this provision of the law persists among some religious groups. Women's reproductive health rights in nations must be ensured and this will also help to prevent tragic cases of microcephaly in fetuses of females who have been infected with the Zika virus. The International Health Regulations should be implemented with a strong and transparent global governance structure. In the U.S., there are conflicting laws and regulations about authorities for components of pandemic response across states and communities. The federal government has minimal direct legal authority or jurisdiction to direct individual states to implement specific pandemic response measures. These issues must be addressed and resolved as an element of pandemic preparedness planning.Many questions regarding the Zika virus remain unanswered. More research is needed on the course of the disease and modes of transmission. Studies are needed about the effects of being infected with more than one virus, such as dengue and chikungunya, on the clinical course of Zika and its health complications in humans. Questions have arisen about cross-immunity and whether previous infection with other flaviviruses affects the clinical course of Zika virus infections in humans. Experts do not yet know whether the Zika virus has become more aggressive over the past decade. How long does the virus remain in the body? Is there sex, racial, or age differences? What are the rates of GBS, ADEM, and microcephaly? What are the effects of the virus at different stages of pregnancy on fetal development? Are there particular risk and protective factors associated with Zika's complications? What are the ecological and evolutionary effects of totally eradicating mosquitoes through genetic engineering and other approaches?Combating the Zika virus and other emerging disease threats in America and abroad will require funding commitments requested by the Obama Administration and that all governments contribute resources and work collaboratively to coordinate their responses. The development of rapid diagnostics, a vaccine and antivirals are cornerstones in combating the disease. America's efforts would benefit from the appointment of a permanent White House Coordinator who can manage a rapid, comprehensive response domestically, as well as work with partner organizations and governments internationally. WHO convened two International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committees on February 1, 2016 and March 8, 2016, and this committee should continue to advise countries on health systems preparedness, vector control, travel advisories and other measures. Additionally, the G-7 Ise-Shima Summit in Japan on May 26-27, 2016 will be an opportune time for the heads of state of seven major advanced economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, U.S., and the UK - to prioritize strengthening global health security to fight Zika and other diseases today and in the years ahead. With the Olympic Games commencing in Rio de Janeiro on August 5, 2016, more than 10,500 athletes and 600,000 spectators will visit Brazil. There is urgency to contain the outbreak for the safety of the athletes, audiences, citizens and businesses. Of concern is the potential for visitors who contract Zika in Brazil to carry the virus back to their home countries, resulting in additional outbreaks globally.Throughout history, whether it is the Zika virus, Ebola, AIDS, smallpox, or influenza, infectious diseases have killed more people than wars, making them decisive shapers of history. They remain clear and present dangers to human health, economic development, and national security in an interconnected 21st century world, and we must remain vigilant against them. Making significant investments now to strengthen the scientific knowledge base, develop new global health technologies that can be deployed in combination with proven public health practices, as well as strengthen health systems with a coordinated national and international response, will ensure our ability to fight Zika and other emerging infectious disease threats more swiftly and effectively, moving from peril to progress in the years ahead.

"The White House accused Republicans of being indifferent to pregnant women and their unborn babies by refusing to spend the nearly $2 billion President Obama wants freed up to fight the Zika virus, escalating the fracas in Washington over spending.Members of Congress say the administration needs far less than the $1.9 billion the president requested in emergency money, and say if it's that important he should be willing to cut elsewhere in the budget to pay for it - both propositions Mr. Obama flatly rejects.Instead, the White House said the desperate nature of the fight against Zika, which has been linked to birth defects in babies born to infected mothers in Latin America, demands quick and generous spending - no matter the effects on the budget.""If Republicans think that it's not that important for us to go to great lengths to protect pregnant women and their babies, then they're certainly entitled to make that case,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. ""I think that's going to be a tough case for them to make, but they're certainly entitled to make it.""The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to spend $1.1 billion in emergency money, with no corresponding cuts elsewhere, meaning the money is tacked onto the deficit. In the House, Republicans won passage of a bill to spend only a little more than $600 million through Sept. 30, with the money coming from elsewhere in the president's health budget.Speaker Paul D. Ryan pushed back Tuesday, saying it's time to ""cut through the noise"" and focus on steps that Congress and the administration have already taken to fund the fight.""Put simply: There is no funding shortage. There never has been,"" his office said in a blog post. ""Instead, the White House continues to politicize this public health crisis. It won't even say how much it has already spent.""The Centers for Disease Control has recorded nearly 600 travel-related cases of Zika in the continental U.S., including a handful through sexual transmission, and scientists expect the virus to flare up on the mainland once temperatures rise and mosquito populations flourish.Mr. Obama, at the insistence of Republicans, has already shifted money from the Ebola fight in West Africa several years ago.The administration was reluctant to move that money, saying the Ebola virus still poses a threat due to flare-ups from isolated cases or sexual transmission.Meanwhile, World Health Organization officials say there's mounting evidence that sexual transmission of Zika is possible ""and more common than previously assumed.""The WHO on Tuesday doubled its recommended abstinence period for people at risk of infection, saying couples returning from areas with the Zika virus should practice safe sex or abstain for eight weeks, instead of just four, to avoid transmitting the disease.Those planning a pregnancy should definitely wait that long before trying to conceive, the agency said, and should wait even longer - at least six months - if the male showed actual symptoms of the virus.""We did not expect that sexual transmission would be as common as we've seen it,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a recent address to the National Press Club. ""We've had 10 documented cases in the U.S. We've never had sexual transmission of dengue or West Nile, but Zika can spread sexually. That adds a new level of risk and a new message that if your partner is pregnant, and you've been in an area with Zika, use a condom."" ","washingtontimes","right","16952","zika",576
"ANALYSIS/OPINION:Robert Novak and Paul Driessen are correct in topping their list of things that people ""need to do"" now to stop the spread of mosquito-borne diseases with the suggestion we ""[d]estroy mosquito-producing sites"" (""It's not just the Zika bug,"" Web, April 3). Unfortunately, they fail to mention two of the most obvious and effective actions everyone can take for accomplishing this. First, just stop littering. Second, clean up the existing roadside litter now before the mosquito-breeding season begins.The Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the Zika virus and dengue, yellow and chikungunya fevers needs only the smallest amount of standing water to reproduce. Our advantage is, as Mr. Novak and Mr. Driessen point out, they rarely fly ""farther than 80 feet from where they hatch."" The mosquito's key advantage is our littered roadsides, which provide multiple breading containers (cans, bottles, plastic bags, tire fragments and anything else that can hold water) every 10 feet or less. Our discarded trash provides the perfect transmission belt to nearly every farm and neighborhood in our nation.Next time anyone is feeling the urge to toss something out a vehicle window, they need to remember that such an simple act can cost them more than a fine. It is increasingly likely to come back and literally bite them (and thousands of other people) with a painful, debilitating or deadly disease. The economic cost will be astronomical.Check with your local government and adopt a road to keep trash-free. The exercise will do you good. ","washingtontimes","right","16896","zika",258
"Sperm banks in the United Kingdom and the U.S. have changed policies to protect clients from the Zika virus.The British Fertility Society asked people who traveled to areas with Zika, mainly South America and the Caribbean, not to donate sperm for 28 days.The California Cryobank will not allow donations from anyone who traveled to those countries or ""have had sex with someone who has traveled there within the past month."" Doctors must report any patient who left the U.S. or Canada. New policy also includes checking all ""records on where sperm donors have traveled over the past year to see if any have visited the nearly 30 countries and territories where the virus has caused outbreaks.""Owen Davis, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said all banks ""keep donations in 'frozen quarantine' for six months to make sure specimens are disease-free.""Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations. (Chile and Canada are the exceptions.) They also carry dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya. Doctors found the disease in one infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy, causing a small skull. This leads to serious mental disabilities. The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the Zika outbreak, however, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.The Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) confirmed a person received the virus after ""sexual contact with an individual with Zika.""""Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,"" explained Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director.

"The factors leading to the current Zika outbreak won't be clear for some time, but environmental health experts say there's a good chance such infectious diseases will become more common as the global climate warms.Mosquitoes, the blood-sucking insects responsible for transmitting Zika virus in Brazil and more than 20 other countries and territories in the Americas, are responsive to changing weather conditions, and experts warn they may increase in numbers as temperatures rise and as changes in precipitation levels create more standing pools of water -- mosquitoes' favorite breeding ground. More of the insects that host the virus could mean a higher chance of being infected. It's too soon to say whether the Zika outbreak, which is causing babies to be born with smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, is driven by a changing climate. But it's certainly the kind of health consequence scientists have anticipated seeing more of as global temperatures rise.  ""If I were a gambler and I wanted to place a wager on the healthiest possible future in terms of these mosquito-transmitted diseases, would that future look more like what we are looking at with climate change -- with warmer temperatures and more intense precipitation -- or a future that looks more like the climate of 1900?"" Dr. Aaron Bernstein, the associate director of Harvard's Center for Health and the Global Environment, told The Huffington Post. ""I would probably bet on the latter.""There are countless factors that contribute to the rise of an infectious disease like Zika, added Kristie Ebi, an expert on health risks and responses to climate change at the University of Washington. There's a good possibility that a warming planet is one of them.""This is the kind of thing the field has been saying is likely to occur for the last 20-plus years,"" she said. It's ""very difficult to tease out"" whether climate change is driving the disease, she added. ""We'll only figure that out in retrospect, but given the known interactions, is this the kind of thing we'd expect from climate change? Yes.""Part of the uncertainty is a result of mosquitoes having different reactions to different levels of heat. While scientists know the insect thrives in a warmer climate and that prolonged warm seasons will increase its breeding season, temperatures that are too high can kill them off. ""The story is not so simple as 'warmer temperatures are better' or 'more rain is better' or 'more drought is better,'"" Bernstein said.For instance, researchers have observed rates of malaria, another mosquito-transmitted disease, slowing with higher temperatures. Malaria, Bernstein explained, is not a virus like Zika but a parasite that must first infect a mosquito before it can be transmitted to humans. Higher temperatures, he said, have been shown to drive mosquitoes to reproduce at a faster rate than they drive the parasite to reproduce, therefore decreasing the rate of malaria. ""Whether that plays for Zika, I have no idea, but it just points to the sort of difficulty in really understanding what's likely,"" Bernstein explained.More standing water may be the bigger concern. With climate change comes more intense rain storms, which leave behind pools of water. It also brings more severe drought, which transforms rushing rivers into slow-moving streams and puddles -- all perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes. ""We're seeing more droughts and more heavy downpour, and so arguably that's more conducive [to mosquito reproduction],"" Bernstein said.Climate change isn't the only human activity creating pools of water and interfering with mosquito behavior. ""We know one of the drivers of these outbreaks is urbanization and urbanization patterns,"" Ebi said. ""We're basically shipping the mosquito around the world.""One contributing example she cited was the global used tire trade. Researchers have observed mosquitoes breeding in pools of water that form in tires' hollows while they're sitting outside. When those tires are shipped to another country, they bring along mosquitoes carrying diseases to places where foreign populations may have less immunity to them. ""As you can see, there are a lot of complex interactions,"" Ebi said. If anything, adding climate change into that mix destabilizes what is already a global health challenge.""The last thing we need to do is throw in some uncertainty into that mix,"" Bernstein said. ""It makes it much more difficult to understand where we might direct our prevention measures, and that's one of the many reasons addressing climate change is so important.""","huffingtonpost","left","16834","zika",766
"On February 1st, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders in some areas affected by the Zika virus a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" (PHEIC). In light of this designation, I welcome the launch of the Strategic Response Framework and Joint Operations Plan by the WHO and its partners. This framework, with its focus on surveillance, response, and research, is an important step in guiding the international response to the spread of the Zika virus. The implementation cost of this strategy is estimated to be $56 million. Global public health emergencies, with their serious social and economic implications, are of concern to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which held a briefing on the Zika virus on February 16th. What have we learned from previous health emergencies such as avian flu and Ebola? Governments can experience fiscal deficits due to increased expenditures on healthcare and social protection programmes. Travel advisories can negatively impact the business of tourism industries. Labour productivity can decrease if workers fall sick or need to care for sick family members. Women, who are the most vulnerable, often shoulder the caregiving for the sick.  And one of the most important lessons we have learned is that ""rumors"" can be detrimental to the efforts to address any public health emergency as they often spread fear based on unsubstantiated claims. As such, we are in great need of evidence-based information and education rather than mere speculation. Indeed, more research is needed on the possible linkages between the Zika virus and microcephaly as well as other neurological disorders.The experience of my own country, the Republic of Korea, in the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) last year demonstrated the power of providing accurate information to the public in responding to the outbreak. These lessons learned demonstrate the utility and need for targeted communication campaigns to educate affected communities on essential protection and prevention measures. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reflects the importance of public health in achieving sustainable development. Strengthening health systems at the local, national, and international levels must be a priority if we want to safeguard against future outbreaks. A holistic approach to this is vital. Our health systems and institutions must also be equipped to respond to the needs of infected women and men, children born with microcephaly, and their families, especially their mothers. We must also consider the environmental dimensions of outbreaks and explore possible contributing factors such as climate change and the recent El Nino phenomenon. The world's most vulnerable are counting on our support to build their resilience to the Zika virus and other future global public health threats. International collaboration through strong and effective multilateral systems will be indispensable moving forward.","huffingtonpost","left","16849","zika",480

"By: Mindy Weisberger Published: 12/16/2015 10:51 AM EST on LiveScienceInfections with Zika virus, which is carried by mosquitos, are on the rise across the Americas, raising concerns among health officials. Although the virus is generally not life-threatening, evidence suggests that it may be responsible for recent increases in birth defects in Brazil and French Polynesia, where infections are more common. On Thursday (Dec. 10), officials in Panama announced the country's first case of locally acquired Zika virus - meaning that a person caught the disease from a mosquito in that country, rather than while traveling elsewhere - raising the number of countries in the Americas with reported cases of Zika infections to 10.Previously, on Dec. 1, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) had issued an alert about the virus. At that time, cases were reported in Brazil, Chile (on Easter Island), Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Suriname and Venezuela.The Zika virus is a relative of the viruses that cause dengue fever, yellow fever and West Nile infections. Symptoms of Zika, as the infection is called, include fever, rash and joint pain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The symptoms typically appear about three to seven days after a bite from an infected mosquito, and last up to a week. Currently, there is no vaccine for Zika, although those infected by the virus can be treated to relieve its symptoms.Infections are transmitted to people through bites from infected Aedes mosquitos, a genus of mosquitos that includes several species that also carry other viruses that are closely related to Zika. The mosquito species Aedes aegypti andAedes albopictus are two of the main carriers of Zika, and live on every continent except Antarctica. [Tiny & Nasty: Images of Things That Make Us Sick]First appearanceInitially detected in humans in 1954 in Nigeria, Zika virus was largely confined to Africa and Asia until the first cases emerged in the South Pacific in 2007, according to a 2009 study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.A major outbreak developed in French Polynesia in 2013, with 19,000 suspected cases reported in a year, the first epidemic other than dengue fever to manifest in the area. After that, Zika spread rapidly across the Americas.In October of this year, health officials in Brazil noted an alarming rise in cases of a congenital condition called microcephaly - which involves underdevelopment of the brain and head - particularly in the regions of Brazil most affected by the virus, according to the PAHO.Traces of the virus were found in affected newborns' amniotic fluid, confirming health officials' fears that Zika virus was linked to the birth defect. Researchers tallied a 20-fold increase in newborns with microcephaly in 2015 compared to 2010. There has been an especially large spike in cases since October, with a total number of 1,248 microcephaly cases - including seven deaths - reported in 14 of Brazil's 26 states.Authorities in French Polynesia have also reported a recent uptick in brain defects and lesions in fetuses and newborns that correspond to Zika virus outbreaks. Although none of the mothers demonstrated symptoms of Zika virus, test results showed that four of them might have been carrying it, according to the PAHO.Health officials are warning pregnant women in areas affected by Zika to take extra precautions against possible infection, particularly during the first trimester.Likewise, the CDC urges travelers - especially pregnant women - visiting countries in South America, Mexico and Central America to safeguard themselves against mosquito bites by covering exposed skin, keeping doors and windows closed or screened, and using mosquito nets and repellents, especially during the daytime, when the mosquitos are most active. on Twitter and Google+.

"Anyone considering travel to the equatorial regions of the Americas has in recent days undoubtedly been advised of the appearance of an unwelcome new addition to the litany of potential health threats in the region -- the Zika virus.The headlines are indeed alarming at first glance. After reaching the Americas only last year, confirmed cases of people infected with the virus have been reported in more than 20 countries and health authorities say it is only a matter of time before it spreads everywhere in the hemisphere.Pregnant travelers are being advised to avoid the region, and women in some countries are being advised to avoid getting pregnant until public health authorities can get a handle on things. There are even reports of a rise in cases of a rare nerve disorder known as Guillain-Barré in tandem with cases of Zika, but investigators have yet to nail down any concrete links between the two.When these new viral threats first appear, the headlines are always scary and often off-putting to people considering travel to areas affected. The reality of the threat is, however, hardly as sensational as some of the articles would have us believe. Tropical America has always been home to a host of threats similar to Zika -- dengue, yellow fever, malaria to name but a few -- and, at least in the last century or so, the vast majority of sensible travelers go home without ever having contracted so much as a sniffle. Like its cousins dengue and chikungunya, Zika is transmitted by mosquitos -- specifically those of the Aedes species. That is the only way to get it. If one is not bitten by mosquitos, one does not contract Zika. Only about 1 in 5 people exposed to the virus actually contract the disease, and, except in the case of pregnant women, that disease is relatively benign. Usually no worse that a case of the flu, with fever, joint pain, headaches and sometimes red-eye. The symptoms usually last up to a week and then pass. Complications requiring hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control, are extremely uncommon, and death is all but unheard of.There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika. Doctors tell afflicted patients to simply get plenty of rest, stay hydrated and take acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve the fever and pain. They do advise against taking painkillers such as ibuprofen, aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs until dengue can be ruled out as those can complicate its symptoms. That's it. Pretty much what your doctor would tell you if you had the flu.Zika has been endemic to equatorial regions in Africa and Asia since the 1950s. It only made the leap across the Pacific in 2014 when cases were reported in French Polynesia and Easter Island, then reached mainland America a year or so later.Brazil was the first country affected in our hemisphere, but it has spread quickly. The CDC now says cases have been reported in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, the Guyanas, Surinam, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. Most of the Caribbean islands have seen cases, along with Mexico and every country in Central America with the exception of Nicaragua. At least a dozen cases have been reported in the United States so far, all of them among people who had recently traveled to the tropics.Much of Latin America is currently under what is called a Level 2 travel warning from the CDC, meaning that travelers to regions where the virus is present should take enhanced precautions to prevent mosquito bites. Since the mosquitos that carry the virus bite predominantly during the daytime, travelers should consider covering exposed skin by wearing long pants and long sleeve shirts and definitely carry and use insect repellant. Sleeping in air-conditioned or screened-in places is also recommended.The only caveat to these relatively measured recommendations is for pregnant women. The virus can spread from pregnant women to their unborn babies and there have been reports of a serious birth defect called microcephaly (children born with smaller-than-usual heads and less-developed brains) among the children of infected mothers. Doctors are still trying to trace a link between the two, and until they decide whether there is one the CDC recommends out of an abundance of caution that pregnant women avoid travel to any areas where the virus has been documented and take strict preventive measures if they must do so.In the end, for non-pregnant travelers, the measures recommended by the CDC are no different than those doctors have been recommending to avoid dengue and other viruses common to tropical regions all over the world. They are, in fact, measures that most travelers who hate mosquitos (and who doesn't?) would take regardless of whether the little parasites transmitted any sort of nasty viruses.So before you cancel any long-planned trips to Latin America, stop and take a deep breath. By all means educate yourself about the symptoms and come prepared with suitable clothing and lots of insect repellant. Check the CDC's website for the list of recommended vaccines and inoculations for travelers to the region. But unless you are pregnant or thinking of getting pregnant soon, don't let a few scary headlines keep you from experiencing everything the world has to offer.

"With fears over the virulent Zika virus rolling across the Western Hemisphere, U.S. Olympics officials have hired a retinue of experts on infectious diseases to advise the committee for the upcoming games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.U.S. Olympics Committee CEO Scott Blackmun sent a letter to athletes and various athletic associations acknowledging the fears over the virus and announcing the new effort to study the situation.""I know that the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil is of concern to many of you,"" Blackmun's letter states. ""I want to emphasize that it is to us, as well, and that your well-being in Rio this summer is our highest priority.""Blackmun goes on to note that the USOC is ""in close contact"" with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other specialists with ""expertise regarding the Zika virus.""The letter goes on to report the known facts on risks of Zika as well as the symptoms associated with the virus.Blackmun's letter ends, though, warning that risk always comes with gatherings of peoples from around the world.""No matter how much we prepare,"" the statement says, ""there will always be risk associated with international competition. Each country, each venue and each discipline will present different risks and require different mitigation strategies.""Blackmun told the Associated Press the letter was just an effort to alert Olympians to the threat of the virus but was also an attempt to allay those fears.""First and foremost, we want to make sure our athletes have accurate information because they're concerned,"" Blackmun said. ""Based on what we know now, the primary threat is to unborn children.""The threat of Zika, though, is just one more worry added to health fears for the 2016 Rio Olympians. For well over a year athletes and coaches alike have expressed serious concerns over the pollution problems in the waters the Rio Olympics will use for competition.Despite claims by Rio's Olympics officials that pollution has been greatly reduced in the famed Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, the pollution seems to be as bad as ever. The problem is so bad that athletes are starting to organize. USA Today said ""four coaches and 11 members of the U.S. team came down with stomach illnesses at the World Junior Rowing Championships after competing in the lagoon.""Despite claims the pollution has been addressed, the Associated Press reported that Rio's Olympic waters are still badly polluted, even far offshore.Rio has a world of other troubles, too. Recently the lights in the Olympic track and field stadium were shut off because of hundreds of thousands in unpaid electric bills. The water was also shut off over arrears in payment.Budget woes have been so bad for the games that Rio Olympics officials announced that players and associations would have to pay their own air conditioning bills for their hotel rooms.

"At Saturday's Republican presidential primary debate, Dr. Ben Carson asserted he would be open to quarantining individuals returning from the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics if they exhibited symptoms of having contracted the Zika virus, calling Latin America's Zika outbreak ""obviously a big deal.""""We've gotten evidence that there can been active viruses in other bodily fluids like saliva and urine. So, this is going to be, obviously, a big deal,"" Dr. Carson said of the Zika virus, in response to ABC News debate moderator Martha Raddatz asking Dr. Carson if quarantining individuals that may have come into contact with the virus was ""going too far.""Asserting that the Zika outbreak in Latin America was ""going to be, obviously, a big deal,"" Dr. Carson advised that ""if we have evidence that they are infected, and that there is evidence that that infection can spread by something that they're doing, yes."" He discouraged, however, ""willy-nilly"" quarantining.The prevalence of Zika virus in Brazil, skyrocketing since December 2015, has triggered alarm in the medical community. The World Health Organization has declared the Zika outbreak a ""public health emergency,"" and the National Institutes of Health a ""pandemic.""Given the millions expected to travel to Rio de Janeiro in August for the 2016 Summer Olympics, experts are warning that the virus could become a global pandemic. NYU's Dr. Arthur Caplan compared families attending the Olympics to visiting Chernobyl, suggesting that only ""Business, money, investment in the infrastructure"" can explain why officials have not postponed the Olympic games on Breitbart News Daily.Dr. Carson urged a ""rapid response"" approach to the Zika outbreak. ""We need a rapid response for ebola, we need rapid response for Zika These are the kinds of things that the NIH, the CDC, can be very effective in. We need to give the the appropriate support for those kind of things,"" he concluded.The hardest-hit areas of Brazil are confirming a new Zika case every two hours. The scope of the danger regarding widespread prevalence of Zika in humans has been the subject of little research. The symptoms of Zika contamination are typically mild: fevers, conjunctivitis, and other symptoms similar but less intense than those of Dengue fever. An estimated 80 percent of those contaminated exhibit no symptoms.Scientists in Brazil discovered in December, however, an astronomical surge in the number of diagnosed cases of microcephaly in newborns, a deformity in which infants are born with skulls too small for their brains, causing severe neurological damage. Brazil has documented over 4,000 cases of microcephaly suspected of having ties to the Zika virus. Thus, experts have warned pregnant women, or women who may become pregnant, have the most to fear from the virus.In addition to the threat of microcephaly, an unknown percentage of adults are at risk for developing Guillain-Barré syndrome after contracting Zika, a debilitating disorder that causes severe muscle pains, paralysis, and, in some cases, death. Colombia has confirmed three Guillain-Barré deaths tied to Zika so far.Very little is known about the potential of Zika spreading from human to human. Almost all known cases of Zika found in human bloodstreams is the product of bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, found in every country of the Western hemisphere save Chile and Canada. Recently, medical experts in Texas have confirmed the first known case of Zika transmission through sexual contact, in an American resident who engaged in sexual activity with a Zika patient that had contracted the virus in Brazil. Additionally, Brazilian scientists have found traces of live Zika virus in the saliva and urine of patients who have been diagnosed with Zika, a sign that person-to-person infection may be possible through these bodily fluids.While Latin America has become the epicenter of the outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned Europe to prepare for a potential outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have warned expecting couples who may have been exposed to Zika in the United States to abstain from sexual activity.American officials have begun preparing for a potential Zika outbreak as the winter nears its end, particularly in southern states and territories. Governor Rick Scott of Florida has declared a state of emergency due to the overwhelming presence of Aedes aegypti in the state, as has the governor of Puerto Rico. The state of Texas has confirmed 10 Zika cases this season.","breitbart","right","16837","zika",730

"Three cases of the Zika virus have been reported in D.C., all from people who traveled outside of the United States, the city's health department said.Of the three cases, one came in 2015, and the other two were confirmed in 2016. One cases from this year involved a women who is pregnant. And all three cases involve people who took trips to Central and South America.The World Health Organization recognized the first local transmission of Zika in the Western Hemisphere in May 2015 and by January local transmission had been identified in South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean.As of Feb. 3, a total of 35 Zika virus disease cases have been reported in the United States, but all have been from people traveled outside the country. None of the cases have originated in the continental United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Zika virus is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes and for most people, it will only cause a mild illness.

"The radiation sterilization of male mosquitoes is being studied by an entomologist as a potential biological weapon to combat the mosquito-borne Zika virus outbreak in the Americas.""After decades of fighting mosquitoes - and mostly losing - technology is bringing new biological weapons to the battle,"" reports the New Zealand online news outlet Stuff.Maureen Coetzee, an entomologist at South Africa's University of Witwatersrand and international expert on mosquito control, is ""conducting research on an anti-malaria strategy that involves breeding male mosquitoes, sterilizing them with radiation and releasing them into the wild,"" notes the report.This approach could also be applied to control Aedes aegypti, the mosquitoes that spread Zika.""The concept was pioneered in the 1950s when US scientists used it to eradicate the screwworm fly,"" points out Stuff, referring to radiation-sterilization. ""Applied to mosquitoes, it relies on two basic facts: They mate only once, and only females bite.""""The strategy depends on releasing enough mosquitoes to crowd wild males out of the mating game, letting the current generation die out without reproducing,"" it adds.Mosquitoes reportedly live for two to four weeks.Coetzee is quoted as arguing that effective control of mosquitoes ""would require releasing millions monthly during malaria season across vast areas.""The radiation-induced sterility technique reportedly allows targeting of individual species of mosquitoes, which is described as one advantage of the strategy over other methods.""It makes sense to target only those mosquitoes that are involved in transmission of disease,"" explained the researcher.Although Coetzee and other scientists have no qualms about trying to kill off the certain species, Stuff notes, the researcher acknowledged that goal is ""highly unlikely.""""There's no silver bullet,"" she added.Stuff concedes that the sterile insect approach is best used in combination with other methods, such as insecticides.However, the use of insecticides to control mosquito populations has its limits, adds the report.""Mosquito populations have grown increasingly resistant, a global problem that Coetzee places on par with the rise of bacteria resistant to antibiotics,"" according to Stuff.Another reported shortcoming of insecticides is that mosquito breeding sites are easily overlooked, indicated Laith Yakob, a vector control expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.The use of genetically modified male mosquitoes was described as the newest variation of using radiation to produce sterile males.""It involves genetically modifying male mosquitoes so their offspring are programmed to die before they mature and are able to reproduce,"" notes Stuff.""Some scientists believe genetic modification is better than sterilization, because dousing mosquitoes with radiation could leave them less vibrant and hurt their ability to compete with their wild counterparts when it comes to mating,"" it adds.The Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly, a neurological disorder that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and developmental problems. It has also been associated with Guillain-Barré, a rare syndrome that causes the immune system to damage nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis.","breitbart","right","16840","zika",506
"Puerto Rico, already reeling from a man-made financial crisis, could have ""tens of thousands"" of infections from the Zika virus, which has been linked to a serious birth defect, imposing an economic toll and forcing the island to import blood supplies from mainland donors, the Obama administration's top scientists said Wednesday.The territory is the only part of the U.S. where Zika has spread locally, instead of hitching a ride with travelers from Brazil or other parts of Latin America. The island's warm ecology makes it susceptible to the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the wily species that carries Zika and blanketed the island with a related virus, chikungunya, in 2014.President Obama has asked Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to combat the Zika virus at home and abroad, citing its potential link to a sharp uptick in the rate of babies born in Latin America with abnormally small heads - a condition known as microcephaly. The request includes about $250 million for Puerto Rico's Medicaid program to support pregnant women with a Zika diagnosis or who are at risk of infection.It is one more task for a politically divided Congress that must decide in the coming weeks whether a financial control board or other drastic measures are needed to rein in Puerto Rico's runaway debt, before the island is shut off from credit markets or dramatically curtails services for its 3.5 million inhabitants.""Clearly, Puerto Rico has many challenges, and Zika is the most recent,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday in a briefing hosted by the Kaiser Family Foundation.The Zika virus has spread to at least 30 countries, mostly in Latin America. Though it normally causes mild, if any, symptoms, scientists are using controlled studies to confirm a link between infection and babies born with microcephaly.""It will tell us whether or not there is a connection and what the magnitude of the connection is,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director for infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health.Puerto Rico reported its first case of locally acquired Zika infection in November - an 80-year-old man - and tallied 30 lab-confirmed cases through Jan. 28, according to the CDC, which expects those figures to balloon.""We think there's the potential for many cases - tens of thousands or even more - of infection with the Zika virus in Puerto Rico, and with about 34,000 births per year, a risk of microcephaly there as well,"" said Dr. Frieden, who noted that the birth defect can incur lifetime medical costs of $1 million to $10 million.""In addition to the tragedy that this can represent, the economic costs can be quite high,"" he said.The outbreak also has implications for the island's blood supply.The Food and Drug Administration this week told people who had traveled to Zika-affected areas, people who had sexual contact with such travelers and those who had experienced Zika-like symptoms not to donate blood for four weeks. It also said areas reporting transmission - such as Puerto Rico - should obtain whole blood and red blood cells from places untouched by the outbreak.Administration officials said Puerto Rico already imports much of its blood supply for transfusions from the mainland, so it is scrambling to develop an FDA-approved test to screen its local supply.Until then, ""in areas like Puerto Rico, that really have a significant ongoing problem,"" blood will be imported from other parts of the U.S., Dr. Fauci said.The CDC has dispatched two dozen workers to combat the virus in Puerto Rico, on top of roughly 50 employees it has stationed there to monitor dengue, a related virus carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.The species is a day biter that likes to breed inside homes. Females, which do the biting, have developed a taste for humans and will bite as many as four people in one blood meal.""Sometimes you're [bitten], and you don't know it. They are kind of deceptive,"" said Alfonso Aguilar, who was born and raised in Puerto Rico and serves as executive director at the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a Washington-based advocacy group.Growing up, he would hear public service announcements that asked the citizenry to wipe out areas of standing water where the disease-carrying insects breed.Mr. Aguilar said his high school friend, Bobby Lopez, liked to kill several mosquitoes and line them up on his desk while they studied - a warning for the other insects to stay away.It didn't work. ","washingtontimes","right","16848","zika",752
"How would we go about stopping the spread of the Zika virus in the U.S.? originally appeared on Quora - the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. Answer by Hillary Clinton, Senator, Secretary of State, 2016 presidential candidate, on Quora:Zika--a virus linked to devastating birth defects--is a serious and urgent threat to the United States. Already, there are more than 900 confirmed cases across U.S. states and territories, and that number is expected to grow as mosquitos carrying the disease spread farther north this summer. In Puerto Rico, the CDC estimates that 1 in 4 people--hundreds of thousands of American citizens--could become infected by year's end. For an island in the midst of a financial crisis, with weakening health care infrastructure and insufficient Medicaid funding, that's a catastrophe in the making.I recently asked two of my senior campaign advisers to go to Puerto Rico to learn more about how Zika is affecting the island and what we can do to mitigate an outbreak. One thing was clear from their discussions with local health and government officials, visits to impacted neighborhoods, and observations at women's health clinics: We need more resources to stop the spread of this disease.First, we must do everything we can to educate the public--especially pregnant women--about the dangers of Zika so that people know to protect themselves against mosquito bites and against sexual transmission of the disease. Puerto Rico has taken an important step by providing education and toolkits to pregnant women through their Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) clinics, but we must do more to raise awareness--in Puerto Rico and across the United States. Next, we have to develop a rapid diagnostic test for Zika--that's a critical step, since most people who get the virus never develop symptoms and could unknowingly infect others. We need to invest in treatments and a vaccine. And we have to step up mosquito control and abatement and improve access to health and family planning services. To put it simply, there's a lot we need to do--and fast. We don't yet know everything about this disease, but what we're learning is alarming. Zika has now been linked to microcephaly, a heartbreaking birth defect that can lead to severe developmental delays and long-term health problems. In Brazil alone, more than 1,000 babies have been born with microcephaly or central nervous system malformations. It is also suspected that, in rare cases, Zika could lead to other neurological problems in adults. Between travel-related cases, sexual transmission of the disease, and the spread of aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are native to the southern United States, experts are warning that Zika could spread much farther into the U.S. than initially expected. We need to do everything we can to fight Zika--but we can't do that without adequate resources. Congress should immediately provide emergency funding for Zika testing and treatment, mosquito control, family planning, and to support maternal and infant health. It's up to us to convince them to do the right thing: Add your name now and call on Congress to address this urgent public health crisis.This question originally appeared on Quora - the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights.

"The Brazilian Health Ministry has confirmed that the Zika virus has caused ""most"" of the microcephaly cases recorded following its discovery in the country.This month, doctors have reported 46 more cases of microcephaly, which occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth. The new cases push the total since October to 508. The Wall Street Journal reports:Authorities continue to investigate another 3,935 cases.A doctor in Brazil recently discovered numerous microcephaly cases that predate the Zika outbreak. Dr. Sandra Mattos found data on 100,000 newborns since 2012. At least 1,600 babies born in the last years had microcephaly or smaller-than-normal heads.""We were very, very surprised,"" stated Mattos. ""Borderline cases seem to be present all along.""According to CBC News:The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) claims rubella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, severe malnutrition, alcohol, drugs, and toxic chemicals can cause microcephaly.CDC director Tom Frieden confirmed scientists found the Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly. He stopped short of claiming that Zika caused the birth defect.Mattos told the World Health Organization (WHO) that ""other potential factors need to be considered,"" since 80 percent of the microcephaly babies live in northeast Brazil. The Colombian government confirmed 3,100 cases of pregnant women with Zika, but none of the babies have microcephaly.Yale University School of Public Health Professor Albert Ko believes the cases of microcephaly in Brazil are just the start of concerns about birth defects linked to the Zika virus.""It seems like microcephaly may just be the tip of the iceberg,"" he stressed, adding:Microcephaly has received the most attention, but Ko found other problems with the infants.""We're seeing a spectrum.

"Five month old child born with microcephaly, in Pernambuco, BrazilSomewhere far outside of the primary battle bubble, a mosquito is busy reproducing, just to make your summer a little bit less enjoyable than it would have been otherwise. Only this year there is rising concern that some of them may carry the Zika virus, an infection related to dengue, yellow fever, and the West Nile virus.The virus, which is known to be transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, can cause fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes) in about 20 percent of cases. The symptoms are usually mild and last for about a week to 10 days. Most people won't even know that they have been infected. Once infected, the person generally develops an immunity to the virus. But if a woman is pregnant, there is a chance that the virus will attack her fetus, causing damage to fetal nerve cells leading to microcephaly (unusually small heads with brain damage) or other birth defects. The latest data suggest that the risk may be as high as 13 percent. There is now a suspicion that it might be causing problems in the eyes of infected newborns. Infection has also been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults, which can cause paralysis and even death.As of May 18, the 544 cases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported within the Continental United States are all travel-associated, involving people returning from affected areas, their sexual contacts, or infants infected in utero. The CDC has also reported 832 locally acquired cases in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. According to ABC News, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director at the CDC ......said approximately 500 people in the U.S. were found to have likely been infected with Zika. However, since 80 percent of people with a Zika infection do not show symptoms, she estimated that thousands may have arrived in the U.S. unaware they were infected with the virus and were potentially able to start a local outbreak through the mosquito population.","dailykos","left","16950","zika",342

"The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with this birth defect have smaller heads and sometimes brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean, and with the high volume of news about the virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.Here are four updates, opinions and developments to know about now:  One of the major hurdles to controlling the Zika virus epidemic is that doctors don't have any tests that can rapidly and accurately diagnose a person with the disease. Now two Texas hospitals say they have developed those rapid tests, and can spit out results in hours, as opposed to the weeks it normally takes, reports Reuters.The tests are available only at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston and Houston Methodist Hospital, but officials are exploring ways to let other scientists benefit from their work. Texas has been pegged as a high-risk state for Zika virus spread in the U.S., based on their history of small dengue fever and chikungunya virus outbreaks. Both diseases are transmitted by the same mosquito that carries Zika virus.U.S. health officials fear that the territory of Puerto Rico, which has already had several cases of locally transmitted Zika virus, is poised to experience a widespread outbreak of the disease. This is because they've recorded tens of thousands of dengue fever cases in the past, and both dengue and Zika virus are carried by the same mosquito. But it appears that Zika virus can be spread sexually too, and to protect residents from contracting the disease, NPR reports Puerto Rican officials have decided to freeze the price of condoms.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people living in areas with local transmission of Zika virus, like Puerto Rico, use condoms consistently and correctly to prevent the potential spread of the disease, especially between pregnant couples. The Brazilian babies born with microcephaly, the birth defect tied to Zika, need physical therapy and mental stimulation in infancy to try to counteract the effects of brain damage suffered in the womb. But poor parents living in the outskirts of big urban centers have to travel hours to get to the nearest health center, and Brazilian experts say that given the country's recession, they doubt the government will construct new ones any time soon, reports Reuters.  As of Feb. 20, Brazilian health authorities have confirmed 583 cases of microcephaly, but they're still investigating 4,107 more cases. Experts say that Brazil's microcephaly cases are unusually severe, and that more babies will be born with microcephaly in the coming months. This will increase the workload struggling health centers have to contend with in the midst of the Zika virus outbreak. The destinations are the Caribbean nation Trinidad and Tobago and the Marshall Islands, located southwest of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. Travelers there should follow strict mosquito bite prevention protocol, like wearing long sleeves and pants and using mosquito repellant. There are now 34 destinations around the globe experiencing active Zika virus transmission.Pregnant Americans should consider postponing their trips to these areas, the CDC advises. Barring that, pregnant women should discuss travel with their OB/GYN, and men who travel to these areas should use condoms consistently and correctly with pregnant partners to prevent sexual transmission of the disease.","huffingtonpost","left","16855","zika",608

Working on their list of excuses to give local media this week for not being at the Republican National Convention. Stocking up on mosquito repellent. Summer 2016 could very well become ""Zika Summer,"" and Senate Republicans' refusal to fund a response to this threat-with no political strings attached-has public health officials terrified.More than five months passed, and Zika has proved to be worse, in many ways, than health officials feared. A suspected link between the virus and the grave birth defect microcephaly was confirmed. Scientists learned that Zika can cause devastating outcomes, including death, in infected children and adults-not just among fetuses. And it became clear that the virus is spread not just by infected mosquitoes but through sexual contact. Health officials are only just beginning to understand the enormous scope of Zika's impact, and the threat of an outbreak in the United States remains acute. The first death caused by Zika was recorded in the United States earlier this month. Yet when members of Congress embarked on a seven-week recess last week, they failed to resolve the question of whether to approve money to combat Zika. ""Without ensuring there are sufficient resources available for research, prevention, control, and treatment of illnesses associated with the Zika virus, the United States will be ill equipped to deploy the kind of public-health response needed to keep our citizens safe and healthy-especially since the spread of mosquito-borne illness is accelerated during the summer months,"" the American Medical Association said in a statement on Thursday.Not confirming a Supreme Court out of political pique is shameful. Not responding to an imminent public health crisis out of political pique is simply dangerous. Please donate $3 today to help turn the Senate blue.

"During the June 26 airing of ABC New's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said gun control is tabled and focus has shifted to the Zika virus.Breitbart News previously reported that the Senate voted down four different gun control proposals on June 20, only to have McConnell agree to a vote for a fifth proposal sponsored by Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine). Collins proposal - which is yet another attempt to use the imprecise no-fly list as a basis for a gun purchase prohibition - has now been tabled.Stephanopoulos introduced gun control by mentioning House Democrats' failed gun control sit-in and Senator Chris Murphy's (D-CT) fruitless ""15-hour talkathon."" Describing Collins' legislation as a ""compromise"" and the last hope for securing gun control at this time, Stephanopoulos asked, ""Why did you vote to table [Collins'] compromise, even though it has the support not only of Republican and Democrat Senators, but also many former retired military leaders?""McConnell responded:McConnell went on to say the sticking point is a disagreement over ""what burden of proof would be required"" to ban certain people from buying guns. Until an agreement over this burden of proof is reached, the Senate is moving on to focus on other things. And the first of the other things is the Zika virus.AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

"The Jamaican Ministry of Health is using dancehall reggae to warn its citizens to exercise extra caution to avoid creating potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes as the Zika virus pandemic sweeping South America threatens to travel north to the Caribbean.In a new video titled ""We Nuh Want Zik V,"" OB/GYN doctor and part-time songwriter/comedian Michael Abrahams teaches Jamaicans how to properly dispose of cans, dumpsters, tires, and anything else that can potentially hold rainwater. ""Make sure there's no water inside,"" he warns, instructing to ""change the water in your vase every day,"" turn over any tires with ridges that can hold water, and punch holes in empty cans so they do not collect water.""And a special shout-out to pregnant ladies,"" he adds. ""Protect yourselves and protect your babies.""While researchers appeared to have been caught off-guard by what was once considered a relatively benign virus, Brazilian medical experts have found a clear, though poorly understood, link between Zika and a number of birth defects when a pregnant woman is bitten by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the virus. Zika appears to particularly trigger instances of microcephaly, a deformity in which an infant is born with a skull too small for the brain, crushing parts of the brain and causing severe neurological damage. Doctors have also recently found evidence that the virus may cause hydrocephalus, an infant deformity in which the skull is filled with fluids that damage the brain.In adults, experts have found ties between Zika and Guillain-Barré syndrome, a disease in which the immune system attacks the nerves, causing extreme muscular pains.Dr. Abrahams, the star of the Jamaican video, also published an editorial in the Jamaica Gleaner, urging Jamaicans to take the threat of Zika seriously. He notes that the Jamaican government has hired 1,000 people to work in communities to eradicate stagnant water pools and make it more difficult for mosquitoes to breed. ""Many of us utilize social media to air grouses, complain and criticize, often with good reason,"" he writes. ""In this case, I invite my fellow Jamaicans to join me and use it to protect ourselves. Please tweet, post, share, text, message and email the link for the MOH document and other information concerning ZIKV to as many people as you can.""Abrahams has made a name for himself as a comedian/gynecologist, raising awareness of the difficulties of his job. ""I tell people, it's not about the vagina, it is not a vagina thing, it is a woman's thing,"" he says in a 2010 interview, noting that he has had to care for many domestic abuse victims, in addition to cases of ""incest and child abuse, going through to puberty issues, to relationship issues, to domestic violence, to gender discrimination, sexual harassment at the workplace, pregnancy, menopause - it's so many things that women have to deal with.""He deals with these issues largely with comedy. In a piece titled ""So You Want to Be a Gynaecologist?"" Abrahams notes that many men tease him for his line of work, as well as ""ask strange questions such as, 'is true seh gynaecologists haffi wear jockstrap?'""His Zika prevention video is far from his first effort to use rhyme to increase health awareness. ""Whether you have big breasts or some itty bitty titty, to pick up cancer in'a dem would be such a pity,"" he laments in a video warning women to self-examine for breast cancer.He has also performed live poetry promoting the legalization of marijuana.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) placed Jamaica on its travel warning list due to its mosquito population, though hospitals have only documented one case of Zika so far. The one case involved a young child who had left the country and contracted the virus abroad. Zika appears to be spreading around the Caribbean, however, with cases in Puerto Rico and Barbados. In addition to the awareness video, the Jamaican Ministry of Health held an event on Saturday titled ""Operation Mosquito Search and Destroy"" to diminish the threat of Zika.Doctors in Jamaica report that, despite these efforts, pregnant women appear unfazed by the Zika outbreak. ""I'm going to be honest with you. I don't think the message has hit home hard yet, because when I listen to the comment of the ladies, they are more like 'Wow, what? An advisory? That sounds extreme,'"" Dr. Sandra Knight of the National Family Planning Board said earlier this month. ""I have not seen an increase in the anxiety of mothers,"" she added.","breitbart","right","16847","zika",763
"By Drs. David Niesel and Norbert Herzog, Medical Discovery NewsUnless you are totally cut off from the news, you have heard about the Zika virus. Maybe more than you want because this is a scary virus, especially if you are pregnant. We have known about this virus for some time. It was first isolated in 1947 and has been pretty much of a scientific curiosity until recently. And then seemly we look up and there is a full-blown outbreak in Brazil that is marching steadily across South and Central America and the Caribbean. But also, it has breached American shores with infected individuals now reported in several American cities.  These Zika infections have originated from travelers to affected areas or those in close contact with those that have traveled in that region. Person to person spread has been shown after sexual contact and the virus can be found in infected individuals in semen, salvia and in urine.  The world is focused on this virus because of its devastating effects on the most helpless among us - babies. When a pregnant women becomes infected, there is a link between Zika infection and her baby being born with a small head and brain. This is called microcephaly. As you can imagine with an infection affecting the brain, microcephaly leads to developmental issues with the baby and many do not survive beyond adolescence.  While microcephaly is obvious at birth, this could be the ""tip of the iceberg"" in terms of the number of children with neurological problems that will be revealed as they grow older. Adults can be infected resulting in neurological consequences also. In infected adults, there is a 24 times higher chance of developing Guillain-Barre syndrome, which results the immune system attacking nerves. GBS can be mild for some, it can last for months and in ~5% of cases, GBS can lead to death.  Recent studies may have started to reveal how the Zika virus causes brain damage leading to the symptoms observed in babies and others. It has been shown that Zika interacts with neuroprogentior cells, which are immature cells on the path to becoming glia cells or neurons, two of the most important cells in the brain. In experiments, 90 percent of the neuroprogenitor cells became infected with the Zika virus and went on to produce more virus. Here is the punch line - this means that two of the major cell types in the brain are susceptible to Zika infection and those infected cells are eventually killed by the virus or slowed in growth significantly. This could be the ""smoking gun"" that explains how Zika can damage the brain.Many adults who become infected with the Zika virus don't experience symptoms, and it's usually mild for those that do, such as joint pain, fatigue and low fever, which usually last two to seven days. However, women who are pregnant or want to become pregnant in the near future should avoid Zika-infected areas, and men who've traveled to Zika-infected area should refrain from unprotected sex. Currently, there are not any treatments or vaccines for Zika, so hang on, we are in for a bumpy ride this summer and beyond.

"A group comprising over 150 medical experts has penned an urgent letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) urging it to have the Rio Olympics either postponed or relocated due to concerns of the Zika virus spreading.The letter expresses that the virus has been spreading and that the games could be affected as well as resulting in certain athletes abstaining due to the nature of this virus.""Currently, many athletes, delegations, and journalists are struggling with the decision of whether to participate in the Rio 2016 Games,"" the letter said. ""We agree with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommendation that workers should ""Consider delaying travel to areas with active Zika virus transmission"". If that advice were followed uniformly, no athlete would have to choose between risking disease and participating in a competition that many have trained for their whole lives.""The greatest concern in the letter was that athletes could unknowingly contract the virus while in RIO and end up bringing it back to their origin nations upon return home, where it could incubate and spread.""It is unethical to run the risk, just for Games that could proceed anyway, if postponed and/or moved,"" the letter advised.The WHO has already stated that the Zika virus is an international health emergency. Carried by mosquitoes, it's already been detected in over 58 countries/territories, primarily those in Central America.Zika is highly contagious and can result in a severe birth defect called microcephaly, which results in children being born with abnormally sized heads that are smaller than normal heads. The virus has also been found to cause Guillain-Barre, a neurological disease that ultimately leads to paralysis.""WHO must revisit the question of Zika and postponing and/or moving the Games,"" the letter said. ""We recommend that WHO convene an independent group to advise it and the IOC in a transparent, evidence-based process in which science, public health, and the spirit of sport come first. Given the public health and ethical consequences, not doing so is irresponsible.""You can learn more about the Zika virus including common FAQ here.","huffingtonpost","left","16951","zika",371
"The Senate had one more vote on Zika funding, and once again it failed, because once again Mitch McConnell refused to eliminate myriad poison pills Republicans larded it up with in the House-Senate conference.

Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) sent a letter to McConnell on Thursday asking him to delay the summer break until after they get an agreement on Zika funding.  ""Attached to this bill are several highly-partisan provisions that make the entire measure unpassable in its current form - regardless of how many times the Senate is forced to vote on it,"" he wrote in the letter.

"To fight Zika, we must fight poverty and powerlessness and ensure that women enjoy their rights.Health ministers throughout Latin America have announced they will unite to stop the alarming spread of the Zika virus. Similarly, the World Health Organization has acted with uncharacteristic haste to curb this virus, of which the world presently knows very little. But there is much we do know about containing Zika's impact, because it is, yet again, a disease of poverty and disempowerment. Therefore, it will take more than health ministers and agencies to overcome it.The speed with which the Zika virus appears to be spreading is only surpassed by the speed at which structural political failures in Latin America have been transformed into apparent personal deficiencies. Zika is transmitted by aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue fever. These mosquitoes breed in stagnant water and are most endemically found where poor people lack adequate plumbing and sanitation, and collect water in open containers. The lack of piped water and sanitation systems throughout Latin America, even in large cities, leaves millions of people at risk of these diseases.We also know that transmission from mother to child appears to pose serious risks to the infant, including microcephaly. This has led to the widespread message from ministries of health across Latin America, telling women not to get pregnant. And this in turn has echoes of an equally misguided and ineffective public health campaign of an earlier era -- to avoid HIVAIDS by abstinence. Just as with that and other campaigns that reduce systemic issues to individual behavior modification, in the case of Zika, the admonitions to women are not just patently ineffectual but constitute cynical abdications of governmental responsibility.In many of the countries where Zika is taking hold, poor women, adolescent girls, and women from marginalized communities simply do not have a choice about sexual relations, nor do they have comprehensive sexual education or secure access to contraception, so they cannot control whether they will get pregnant. Let alone those who are impregnated through criminal sexual assault. Moreover, even with contraceptive access, some women and girls will inevitably get pregnant.Some of the countries in which the virus has broken out have the most restrictive abortion laws in the world, courtesy of governments that are handmaidens to religious ideology rather than protectors of reproductive rights. Take El Salvador, where there are no exceptions for the criminalization of abortion. The trend there is to prosecute women for infanticide (which carries a much stiffer penalty) than for having procured an abortion. Abortion law in Brazil, where Zika has to date had the largest number of cases, is being challenged presently, and no doubt other challenges will follow.But we might all ask: Why do poor women and girls (and potentially their children) need to be put through this needless suffering, rather than ensure access to abortion where it is legal and also reform laws and policies to eliminate structural discrimination against women who are without access to contraception, abortion and sexuality education that meets internationally accepted standards of human rights?As Zika demonstrates, precisely because of our reproductive capacities, it is women in particular who experience their poverty and marginalization through their contact with indifferent health systems. It is women who again will pay the greatest consequences of the impacts of the lack of public health measures, inadequate social protection, and discriminatory laws and, to boot, may be blamed for ""getting themselves pregnant.""The efforts of President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and other regional leaders to bring health ministers together, and of WHO's quick response should be applauded. But the response to Zika needs to go beyond immediate containment and vector control, and international health ""security"" to push for meaningful government commitments necessary to address underlying social conditions and discrimination against women.Alicia Ely Yamin is lecturer on law and global health, director of the JD MPH program, and policy director of the Harvard FXB Center, all at the Harvard T.H.

"Zika is primarily a mosquito-borne virus that is very difficult to detect in most human carriers, currently impossible to cure, spreading very rapidly, and believed to increase the risk of birth defects when contracted by pregnant women.There seems to be little hope of containing the outbreak without killing the mosquitoes, but the most effective pesticide, DDT, has been banned since the first great junk-science scare perpetrated by the environmentalist movement. Millions of people have died unnecessarily over the past half-century as a result. Are we going to consign millions more to death or disability, because the Greens can't bear to give up their first ""big win?""A growing chorus of voices is calling for the return of DDT, including Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Orient pointed out that other pesticides are ""far more toxic and expensive"" in a recent interview with Breitbart News. Also, mosquito-control experts say the bugs are developing a resistance to alternative pesticides.Another strategy proposed for combating Zika involves genetically engineering mosquitoes to wipe out their population, by making it impossible for them to breed. We might ask if the cost and potential risk of such techniques - ""gene editing"" is considered a potential national security threat by the intelligence community - makes DDT the better alternative.An awful lot could go wrong with unleashing swarms of gene-edited mosquitoes, and even in the best-case scenario, it would take much longer to eliminate mosquito populations with genetic techniques. Effective DDT deployment could begin almost immediately.Another version of this strategy involves using radiation to sterilize male mosquitoes and releasing millions of them into the wild, where they would displace fertile males in competition for females, producing a smaller crop of offspring. This approach would be even more time-consuming and less effective than gene-editing the mosquito species to effectively become extinct, and it would require the regular creation of radioactively-sterilized male mosquito batches to keep the population down.Advocates of fighting Zika with DDT include Jay Ambrose at the Tampa Tribune, who declares, ""Warrior greenies, get out of the way. You've done enormous hurt in this world, you appear prepared to keep it up, and it's time to allow people their health, their lives and a chance to fight back more effectively against mosquitoes that have been having at us from ancient times to right this minute.""Ambrose notes that Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of vector-borne diseases at the Centers for Disease Control, has also favored DDT deployment. ""That concern about DDT has to be reconsidered in the public health context,"" Petersen told the New York Times.""I have lost two friends to West Nile virus and have no patience for the environmental people who condemn our most fragile populations to death and diseases,"" Dr. Michael Swickard wrote this week, calling for a fresh look at DDT to keep Zika at bay. ""If they, the environmentalists wish to die, so be it, but the great martyrs of our world did not send women and children into the wilderness instead of going themselves.""""Perhaps it's time to give mosquito eradication another chance. And those efforts might include the use of potent pesticides like DDT, although in a more judicious and measured manner,"" mused the Salem News, whose editors are much more accepting of past warnings against widespread use of the pesticide than other critics of the ban. ""A careful and scientifically guided use of these pesticides can have their desired effect on mosquito populations while minimizing any environmental side effects.""The Salem News noted that although the World Health Organization has declared Zika a global emergency, most of their recommendations amount to common-sense warnings about staying away from mosquitoes in the outbreak areas, and it is almost impossible to ensure such recommendations are followed.""By forbidding DDT and relying on more expensive, less effective methods of prevention, we are causing immense hardship. Small environmental losses are inferior to saving thousands of human lives and potentially increasing economic growth in developing nations,"" wrote senior fellow Diana Furchtgott-Roth at the Manhattan Institute.She found it somewhat absurd that the more mild Zika virus could produce enough anxiety to crack the DDT ban after malaria and other deadly mosquito-borne diseases had already killed millions, and knocked $100 billion off the GDP of sub-Saharan Africa but if Zika is the plague that finally wakes the world up, so be it.Much has changed since the Sixties.Our technology is more advanced, and we have learned a great deal about how to handle substances like DDT. We need to make a decision about using an effective weapon against Zika or allowing the virus to enter blood supplies and mosquito populations in the United States, at which point the pressure for a return to effective pesticides will become overwhelming. By that point, untold numbers of people in South America, the Caribbean, and perhaps soon the Zika-friendly climes of Asia will have suffered needlessly.DDT was banned because of a false panic about thin bird egg shells. Some are advising Zika-affected areas to minimize the risk of birth defects by not having children. Is this really a hard choice to make?","breitbart","right","16842","zika",881
"House and Senate Democrats told Republican leaders Thursday to postpone a Memorial Day recess until their demands for Supreme Court nomination hearings and emergency spending to combat the Zika virus and other crises are met.From the opioids and heroin crisis to the lead-tainted water scandal in Flint, Mich., Congress faces a larger workload than ever but has opted to work less in a contentious election year, according to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.Congress is set to skip town Thursday for its Memorial Day break and will not return until the second week of June.""We have work to do - cancel the recess, stay here, do your job,"" Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said, assembling with Democrats on the east steps of the Capitol in front of a bank of cameras and onlooking tourists.Republicans say their rivals are using the crises as a political cudgel to extract spending that isn't offset with cuts elsewhere, when they should be funding health agencies through the regular budgeting process.They mocked Democrats for holding Thursday's press event in the direct sun, only to take off without fielding questions.""They also must have blown your irony meters - while they were over there calling on the Senate to do its job, they are simultaneously preventing the Senate from doing its job by blocking the bipartisan defense bill,"" said Donald Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.For now, they insist that Congress has millions sitting in federal accounts to combat the prescription opioids crisis, while state funding will be paired with a Senate deal to address the Flint water crisis.GOP negotiators are trying to reconcile a $1.1 billion Senate deal to gird for the Zika virus, which causes serious birth defects, with a House bill that would take $622 million from the Ebola fight in West Africa and other health programs to deal with the mosquito-borne illness.""The House has acted to provide the funding we need this year to combat the Zika virus and kill mosquitos,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, said. ""Now, we need to go to conference to negotiate a solution with the Senate that is responsible and effective.""Mrs. Pelosi named five Democrats to that conference Thursday, even as her party says Republicans haven't taken Zika and other crises seriously.Both Zika measures, for instance, are far short of the $1.9 billion in emergency spending that President Obama requested.""Our top public health officials have been extremely clear: $1.9 billion is the amount needed to protect American children and families from Zika,"" Mrs. Pelosi said. ""Anything less will severely damage our ability to respond to this virus, and endanger Americans across the country.""From the Capitol steps, Democrats applauded each other and repeated their mantra of the year - ""Do your job.""The setting allowed them to point out the Supreme Court across the lawn, which is operating with eight members after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February.Republicans have said they will not hold hearing on President Obama's pick to replace Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland. They want the next president to fill the vacancy, so the American people have a say.Democrats said Mr. McConnell's refusal to take up the nominee is a dereliction of duty that allows conflicts in the lower courts to languish.""The Supreme Court must resolve these conflicts and settle the law,"" Rep. G.K. Butterfield, North Carolina Democrat, said.Notably absent from their to-do list was the unfolding crisis in Puerto Rico, where officials say they cannot pay $72 billion in bond debt and need restructuring powers from Congress.Democrats linked arms with GOP members and pushed a rescue bill through the House Natural Resources Committee on a 29-10 vote Wednesday.The bill, which imposes an oversight board to review the territorial government's decisions and petition for debt restructuring, must still clear the full House and then the Senate before it reaches Mr. Obama.Top Democrats and the Treasury say the latest version of the legislation is the best they can do in a divided Congress.Yet Rep. Luis Gutierrez, Illinois Democrat, and Sen. Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, rejected that view at a joint news conference Thursday, saying the board of seven appointed members is too powerful and tilted toward GOP representation.They will demand changes or else reject the measure, even as Puerto Rico nears a July 1 deadline to pay creditors $1 billion.""I don't believe in being jammed for a bad bill,"" Mr. Menendez said.For his part, Mr. Reid has cautioned his troops to hold their fire until the House sends over a finished product.""Let's wait until we get the bill before we start choosing sides,"" he told reporters earlier this week. ","washingtontimes","right","16947","zika",798
"On Friday, Brazilian researchers detected Zika virus in saliva and urine for the first time. While it's still too early to say whether the disease can be spread by the fluids, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its health guidelines for pregnant women to include sexual health recommendations. The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   With the high volume of news about the Zika virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps. Here's the latest information you should know: Brazil's world-famous Carnival -- a week of street parties and parades that draw millions of revelers to Rio de Janeiro and other cities throughout the country -- kicks off Friday. Despite official health warnings about the need to cover up in long sleeves and pants and use mosquito repellant to ward off Zika virus-carrying insects, Carnival enthusiasts are looking forward to partying the night away during the festivities. Epidemiology experts, meanwhile, have called the tradition an ""explosive cocktail"" that could fuel the spread of the virus. Scientists in Brazil detected Zika virus for the first time in urine and saliva Friday, and marked the fluids ""active,"" meaning they're capable of transmitting Zika virus. It's still too early to say whether or not the virus can be spread via saliva or urine, but the discovery -- in combination with a confirmed case of sexually transmitted Zika in Texas -- prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to update its sexual health recommendations for pregnant women.In addition to avoiding travel in areas with active Zika outbreaks, CDC officials recommend abstaining from sexual contact or using a condom if a pregnant woman has a male partner that lives in or travels to a Zika-afflicted area.Nicaragua and Honduras each reported their first cases of Zika virus in pregnant women Thursday -- three cases in Nicaragua, and six cases in Honduras. At last count, Nicaragua had a total of reported 29 cases of Zika in the country, and Honduras report 3,200 cases.Microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and neurological development problems is strongly suspected to be linked to Zika virus in pregnant women, though the link hasn't been formally established yet.  Although the Brazilian government hopes worldwide collaboration could mean developing a quick and reliable Zika blood test within months, many researchers think that timeline is unrealistic.""The likelihood of this happening soon is close to zero,"" Robert Lanciotti, chief of the CDC's diagnostics laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado, told Reuters. ""It is a long-standing problem that many people have been unable to solve even with cutting-edge molecular biology.""Part of the problem is that Zika virus antibodies closely resemble the antibodies in similar viruses. Another problem is that individuals infected with Zika frequently don't display symptoms, and when they do, the mild rash, fever and aches associated with Zika are almost identical to other tropical infections.Because Zika virus can be transmitted sexually, the CDC issued new guidelines about how couples should protect themselves from potentially getting the disease. It boils down to condoms and/or abstinence. The CDC also updated their guidance about Zika virus testing for pregnant women traveling from a Zika-affected area. Asymptomatic pregnant travelers can now be tested for Zika virus up to 12 weeks after their arrival date, while the old guidelines steered asymptomatic women to an OB/GYN for serial ultrasounds. Cecile Pouilly, a spokeswoman for the United Nations, said the U.N.'s high commissioner for human rights is asking the governments of Zika virus-affected areas to repeal abortion restriction laws.""How can they not offer (women) the possibility to stop their pregnancies if they wish?"" Pouilly said to the Associated Press. Because Zika virus is possibly linked to birth defects and can be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy, a handful of countries have advised women to postpone pregnancy during the outbreak. Many critics have pointed out that this ""advice"" falls short -- after all, it usually takes two people to create a pregnancy, so why exclude men from that message?Secondly, the countries advising women not to get pregnant have some of the strictest abortion laws in the world, and access to free birth control and comprehensive sex education is spotty at best. Finally, some countries affected by Zika virus have alarmingly high rates of sexual violence against women -- another sign that some women don't have any control over if and when they get pregnant.Florida Gov. Rick Scott compared mosquito preparedness to getting ready for a hurricane, reports the AP. To make sure Florida is ready for the mosquitos that can transmit Zika virus, Scott asked the CDC to furnish the state with 500 Zika virus testing kits and training to help hospital workers recognize the signs of the disease. In the past, Florida has faced and contained small outbreaks of dengue fever and chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same mosquito that carries Zika virus. ","huffingtonpost","left","16836","zika",1026
"As Brazil struggles to contain the Zika virus in what has now become a pandemic, the nation officially begins its annual Carnival. Despite experts deeming the scantily clad nationwide block party an ""explosive cocktail"" for a mosquito-borne illness, thousands are expected to flood the streets of the nation's biggest cities and have a good time.While festivities officially began Thursday, revelers took to the streets already last weekend to begin their celebrations. In these events, the presence of the Zika virus permeated the celebrations. Some governments, like in Rio de Janeiro, used events to promote awareness for containing the Zika virus. One private group of partiers used their display to sing away the threat of Zika, dressed as Olympic gods and singing, ""If you leave still water [around]/the larvae grow/from larvae come mosquitos/Leave me alone, Zika! Scare the evil away.""The Zika virus is spread through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, found in all nations of the Western Hemisphere except Canada and Chile. While 80 percent of those who contract Zika remain asymptomatic, and adults with symptoms often recover rapidly, experts have found ties between Zika and the prenatal disorder microcephaly, in which a child is born with a skull too small for his or her head, causing severe neurological damage. In adults, Zika has been linked to Guillain-Barré syndrome, which causes severe muscle pain, paralysis, and death.The high concentration of people in hot, confined spaces concerns many virologists regarding the ease with which Zika may spread. ""There will be great concentrations of people wearing little clothing, with not much insect repellant, which makes mosquito bites easier to get,"" the head of Brazil's Society of Infectious Diseases, Sérgio Cimerman, said. ""The Carnival could become an explosive environmental cocktail that will accelerate the spread of Zika.""During Thursday's celebrations, Zika was such a protagonist at the Sao Paulo Carnival that the most popular revelers at the event were disguised as Aedes aegypti mosquitos, taking photographs where they pretended to sting passersby.The city of Sao Paulo's health secretary, Alexandre Padilha, joined in on attacking the ""mosquitoes.""Not all of Sao Paulo state is participating in Carnival this year, however. Capivari, a city of 50,000 people, canceled its Carnival celebrations to invest the money that would have gone into staging the event into Zika reseach. Capivari is among at least 48 cities nationwide that canceled official Carnival celebrations entirely.In Rio de Janeiro, considered the capital of Carnival, the show must go on. The city's government has installed tents in the traditional ""blocks"" where parties occur with the ""Xo Zika"" (""Leave Me Alone Zika"") label, where people can gather information on how to eradicate the mosquitos that carry the disease. Officials expect more than one million tourists and four million Brazilians to gather in Rio throughout the weekend. The city is divided into 505 ""blocks,"" each its own party.Speaking to the AFP, a number of revelers noted the desire not to think about the many problems plaguing Brazil this weekend, Zika paramount among them. ""You have to have fun,"" said ""carnival fanatic"" Angela Pessanha, adding that the carnival ""is the best way to give everyone a good dose of fun.""""Those are all important things that worry Brazilians, but I am not going to worry about them until after Carnival,"" Pedro Maciel, a student, told AFP, referring to both the Zika outbreak and Brazil's sluggish economy. Teresa Curi, who sells costumes in Rio de Janeiro, agreed. ""Carnival is to forget all that; at Carnival, people let go of everything anguishing them and embrace what they desire, like men dressing as women.""Recife, a city in which experts estimate that up to 100,000 have been exposed to Zika, the Carnival continued throughout the night. Revelers greeted tourists at the Guararapes Gilberto Freyre International Airport with colorful umbrellas:Property owners in charge of renting rooms to partiers have reported a much slower travel season than usual. (""In more than 40 years, I do not remember ever having such a bad year,"" said one.) Nonetheless, photos showed the streets of Recife filled with partiers in full costume.Carnival will continue throughout Friday and Saturday, with Saturday night being the last major event, and also the biggest.","breitbart","right","16836","zika",709
"Congressional negotiators are crafting a deal that offers roughly a third to half of President Obama's $1.9 billion request to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus, but the parties haven't agreed on whether to borrow the money or pay for it now with cuts elsewhere in the massive federal budget.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican, kicked off bicameral talks Wednesday with a plea for speedy action, saying dollars ""must get out the door now"" to stem the disease, which causes serious birth defects.The White House and its Democratic allies want to tack any Zika spending onto the deficit, however, it is a nonstarter for House Republicans.""It needs to be fully offset,"" Mr. Rogers said.So far Mr. Obama has shifted nearly $600 million, most of it from the Ebola fight in West Africa, to combat Zika in the near term, though he wants Congress to backfill that money and combat the latest global health scare at home and abroad.The Senate approved $1.1 billion in emergency spending last month to combat Zika, though the House later moved to take $622 million more from the Ebola account and other health accounts to address the emerging threat.Conferees sat down for opening statements on the competing plans Wednesday, four months after Mr. Obama submitted his request and just weeks before Congress breaks for party conventions in July.Sen. Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat who helped to negotiate the Senate package, said the final product cannot dip below $1.1 billion, though she is worried that time is running out for an agreement on how to pay for it.""If they come back here with a package that takes money away from some other critical health care issues to pay for this, they'll have a riot in the streets. I don't know why they'd even propose it,"" she said. ""But we'll see.""House GOP aides said the negotiations have just begun, and that $622 million remains their opening position in the talks.The Zika outbreak in Brazil has been linked to an uptick in the rate of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly, though scientists say the disease can probably cause an array of devastating birth defects.Zika is blanketing on Puerto Rico, and the Centers for Disease Control has recorded nearly 700 travel-related cases in the 50 states and the District, though it expects the virus to spread on its own this summer.Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Vern Buchanan are among the Florida Republicans who've urged Congress to approve Mr. Obama's full request, though party leaders say the administration has enough money to deal with upfront costs.Rep. John L. Mica, Florida Republican, said the CDC should spend money it has more wisely.""It needs to be directed properly to do the most good,"" he told CDC Director Tom Frieden Wednesday at a meeting among the Florida delegation.Dr. Frieden, visibly frustrated, said with limited dollars, he cannot bolster research and also monitor pregnant women who become infected.While Mr. Mica left the room, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz asked: ""Do you have a money tree growing in the courtyard of the CDC?""Dr. Frieden said he did not. ","washingtontimes","right","16967","zika",534
"WASHINGTON -- Democrats spent much of Wednesday reminding Republicans that mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus are now spreading to the U.S. In fact, there are already a good number present in 30 states. ""The mosquitoes are coming,"" Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) told reporters. ""The mosquitoes are already here. You can't build a fence to keep them out, and the mosquitoes won't pay for it. The mosquitoes are here -- this is not a [President Barack] Obama fantasy.""A handful of House Democrats joined their Senate counterparts to put pressure on Republicans regarding a $1.9 billion request by the White House to combat the virus, which causes microcephaly and other fetal brain defects. Senate Republicans signaled interest last week in working with Democrats to push through emergency funding for Zika, which is threatening thousands of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said this week that appropriators are working to get to the right number. Republicans are floating less than the amount Obama requested, but more than $1 billion.Democrats want the full amount. With little chance of a vote on emergency funding ahead of Congress' break next week, Democrats lined up to vent their frustrations.""Senate Republicans finally said last week they were willing to work with us,"" said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). ""I was encouraged by our conversations. But it has been nearly a week since we have had those conversations."" Republicans are now trying to find offsets for emergency Zika funding to appease members within their conference, and are also considering attaching Zika funds to the appropriations process. Democrats are opposed to both approaches, arguing that the appropriations process is too slow and that offsets are unnecessary. ""If this is not an emergency, there is nothing that is,"" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). ""No floods, no earthquake, no fire, nothing will be an emergency if this isn't.""Reid added that he has yet to see a piece of paper with a specific dollar amount from Republicans. He wouldn't say whether Democrats would accept a slightly smaller amount than what they've already asked for.""We are down to budget priorities that cannot be cut further,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said.""We are less than 100 days out from the Olympics in Brazil,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.). ""We should have acted long ago. This is a true emergency.""Brazil has been devastated by the virus, recording 91,000 new cases of Zika this year alone. Speaking to The Huffington Post, DeLauro added that health officials have voiced serious concern over the upcoming Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.""Our athletes will be frightened when they go,"" DeLauro said. ""Their families will be frightened. If there is anything that can be determined between now and then that they can avail themselves of in order to protect themselves, then let's get to it.""The only way athletes and others traveling to Brazil will be prepared, DeLauro said, is if emergency money is made available for research, diagnostics and vaccines. What kind of tone are health officials displaying in meetings? DeLauro summed it up in one word -- ""anxiety.""Earlier this month, officials said they would start to redirect over $500 million that Congress had already approved to battle Ebola. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that if Congress did not provide emergency money for Zika, officials would need to dip into pots for research on malaria and tuberculosis.","huffingtonpost","left","16918","zika",606

If it happens, it's bad luck,"" said Nadal.He added, ""I see people conducting their lives normally.  I see people walking, people on the beach, people in restaurants, people having completely normal lives.""David Ferrer, also in Rio de Janeiro for the tournament, expressed a casual attitude toward the mosquito virus, as well. ""I'll try to take precautions, but I'm not obsessed about it,"" he commented.Rio de Janeiro will host the 2016 Summer Olympics in August. Despite the name, the Summer Olympics will take place during winter in Brazil, so officials hope the cooler weather will kill the Aedes aegypti mosquito known to spread Zika and thus diminish the threat. Spring formally begins in September.U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo said the Zika virus could keep her out of the Summer Olympics.""If I had to make the choice today, I wouldn't go,"" she declared to Sports Illustrated.Stadiums in Manaus, Salvador, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, and Sáo Paulo will host the Olympic soccer games instead of those in Rio de Janeiro. They hosted games during the 2014 World Cup.But those areas ""have higher rates than Rio de Janeiro of mosquito-borne viruses like Zika, dengue, chikungunya and malaria.""Olympic Spanish swimmer Mireia Belmonte said she will not attend the games if her ""health is in danger.""""There is still a long way to go until the Games and things can change, but the important thing is to know that we are going to be safe and that our health is not being to be put at risk,"" she stated.The Brazilian government has advised women to delay pregnancy for up to two years due to the possible connection to microcephaly, a rare birth defect that occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has decided not to postpone the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro despite the widespread presence of Zika virus in host nation Brazil.""Our priority is to protect the health of the athletes,"" announced Dr. Richard Budgett, medical director of IOC. ""The IOC absolutely is not complacent. We do take this very seriously.  Everything is being done to contain and reduce this problem in the lead-up to the games.""U.S. Olympics officials hired experts on infectious diseases to advise the committee on the Zika virus. The committee told athletes they will address their fears and stay up-to-date on the situation.However, an Australian doctor with the Olympic team believes the Rio de Janeiro water poses more of a threat towards the athletes than the Zika virus.Tests found ""disease-causing viruses"" in the Guanabara Bay and aquatic venues, including sailing, rowing, canoeing, open-water swimming, and triathlon.""If someone gets a nasty gastro infection, vomiting and diarrhea, it's not ideal for competing in an Olympic environment,"" explained Dr. David Hughes, adding:The Australian Olympic Committee encouraged its female athletes to educate themselves about Zika and ""consider the risks of competing in the Rio Olympics due to the outbreak of Zika.""""Any team members who are pregnant at the time of the Games need to consider the risks very carefully before deciding whether to proceed with travel to Brazil,"" they said.Brazil promised to fumigate and sterilize Olympic stadiums leading up to the games. The health workers plan to follow the same procedures every day during the Olympics.Dr. Art Caplan of the NYU Langone Medical Center told Breitbart News Daily the Olympic committee should delay the games for at least six months.""You've got this outbreak going on, and you're going to expose hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, who go down there to attend the Olympics or participate in them,"" he stated. ""We don't have a cure, we don't have a vaccine, there is now a couple of cases that have been reported about transmission of the virus into the blood supply, we don't have a good test for that,"" he said, then asked, ""Why would we be trying to run an Olympics in a country that is straining, anyway?""","breitbart","right","16847","zika",719
"Brazil authorities ordered health workers to sterilize Rio de Janeiro's Sambadrome, which will serve as the center of the 2016 Summer Olympics, over the fear of the Zika virus.The stadium holds 90,000 people and often hosts major events such as concerts and celebrations. The next major event occurs in two weeks with the famous Rio carnival.More than 3,000 health workers in yellow suits, goggles, and gloves sprayed down the massive structure to fight against the disease.""We are losing the battle in a big way,"" admitted health minister Marcelo Castro.The Pan-American regional wing of the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the disease will spread to nations with the mosquito carriers. They exempt Chile and Canada since those countries do not contain the Aedes mosquitoes.The workers will continue to inspect and disinfect these venues on a daily basis during the events. Stagnant water remains the main target as it is a breeding ground for the mosquitoes.Patients often experience mild symptoms with Zika, but pregnant women face a larger danger. Experts have shown a link between Zika and microcephaly, which causes a baby to be born with a skull too small for their brains. This leads to serious mental disabilities.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital.The U.S. and other countries have advised pregnant women not to travel to Brazil.The Australian Olympic Committee pushed their female athletes to educate themselves about Zika and ""consider the risks of competing in the Rio Olympics due to the outbreak of Zika.""""Any team members who are pregnant at the time of the Games need to consider the risks very carefully before deciding whether to proceed with travel to Brazil,"" they said.Athletes will receive mosquito repellent from officials, who also recommends everyone wear long sleeves when possible.""The health and wellbeing of all our team members is paramount, especially those females in the team of child bearing age,"" declared Australian Olympic Team Chef de Mission Kitty Chillier. ""We have a responsibility to ensure that we educate and inform all prospective team members of the potential risks and to put in place whatever mitigating measures we can.""Brazil has registered more than 3,000 infants with microcephaly since the outbreak occurred.

"The government of Colombia has announced that the Zika virus has infected more than 2,100 pregnant women, doubling the cases in over a week.The National Health Institute confirmed 20,297 cases in Colombia. The latest numbers ""make Colombia the second most affected country in the region, after Brazil."" The majority of infected live in the Caribbean region. More than 60% of those are women.Unlike Brazil, Colombian officials have not reported any cases of Zika virus leading to microcephaly, a disorder in which an infant's skull is too small to fit his or her brain. Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly.Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the outbreak of Zika, however, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.Colombian officials urged women to delay pregnancy due to the outbreak.""It is recommended that women postpone - to the extent possible - the decision to become pregnant until the country can move out of the epidemic phase of the Zika virus,"" pleaded the Health Ministry.Brazil, El Salvador, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico have also advised women against getting pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.The National Institutes of Health acknowledged that the Zika virus outbreak has reached pandemic levels in Latin America.""You have multiple countries in South America and in the Caribbean, so by anybody's definition that would be considered a pandemic,"" explained Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases branch at the institute.His comments come after experts and the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the disease had ""explosive pandemic potential.""

"The Zika virus has made its way into many countries around the world, and has been directly linked to severe birth defects as leading experts issue warning after warning. This mosquito-borne virus has many people on edge in the US, and there are some helpful facts that you should be aware of it, because a recent survey revealed that Americans are misinformed.The Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health recently conducted a survey that polled over 1,200 adults and 105 households where there was a woman who was currently pregnant or who was planning to have a child within the next 12 months.The findings revealed that many people are entirely unaware of the current Zika facts.23% were not aware that Ziki can cause microcephaly, a birth defect where infants suffer from abnormally small heads. The horror stories coming from Brazil have already revealed that thousands of babies are being born severely deformed from this virus.About one out of five households that were polled said they thought a new vaccine that prevents Zika had already been found. The reality is that a vaccine such as this is years away from being human ready.25% believed that the symptoms of the Zika virus are obvious and easily identified. But the fact of the matter is that the majority of those who are infected do not demonstrate any outward signs of illness.Furthermore, one quarter mistakenly believed symptoms were likely to be apparent, when in fact most of those who are infected show no signs of illness.""We have a key window before the mosquito season gears up in communities within the United States mainland to correct misperceptions about Zika virus so that pregnant women and their partners may take appropriate measures to protect their families,"" explained Gillian SteelFisher, director of the poll and research scientist at Harvard.You can learn more about this virus and how you can protect yourself and your loved ones by visiting the information page on the CDC at: ","huffingtonpost","left","16895","zika",356
"Like many women, Claire, 31, is not totally certain when she wants to start trying for another baby. She has a 6-year-old from a previous marriage, and a 5-month-old with her current husband. They would like at least a two year gap between their youngest and another baby, so they're not pulling double diaper duty.But at the same time, Claire has begun questioning whether she should move up her timeline due to Zika, the disease that can lead to birth defects like microcephaly -- and that might soon be more of an issue in the United States.""We're not totally sure how we want to deal with it yet, since Zika isn't fully understood,"" said Claire, who currently lives in Indiana but is planning on a move to the South. ""We tentatively talked about moving the conception of another child up, before things really take off with the virus this summer, but we're not really in a position to have another child right now.""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently monitoring nearly 300 pregnant women in the United States and its territories who have tested positive for Zika. To date, there has not been a single case of the virus that has been contracted in this country (that is not true of Puerto Rico), but many experts believe it's only a matter of time before there are pockets of the disease that originate here. All of which means that many women and their partners have begun to grapple with the possibility of Zika, and whether it means they should change their plans for pregnancy in any way. ""My husband and I have always wanted to have children who are two to three years apart,"" said Samantha*, 30, from Texas. The couple's first child, a girl, is 14 months old, so this is right around when they hoped to start trying. Zika, however, has given her pause.""I'm definitely concerned,"" said Samantha. ""I'm not scared, but I'm also not feeling super gung-ho, like, 'Yes, of course we're going to start trying regardless of the risks.'""Though her husband says he isn't worried at all, Samantha has thought about postponing trying for a year or two, at least until scientists understand more about the disease and how much of an issue it will ultimately become in the United States. Things are potentially even more difficult for families who have been trying, unsuccessfully, to get pregnant for months or years, and who feel they simply cannot wait, no matter the potential risk. Lauren, 36, has a 6-year-old and has been trying for two years to have a second child. She has had two miscarriages and she and her husband have gone to a reproductive endocrinologist, though they are not currently undergoing fertility treatment.""I thought about [putting things on hold],"" she said. ""My sister and sister-in-law are both medical professionals, and they both want to have another baby. One of them is moving forward and trying for another one, and one is not.""""If I were younger, I would probably hold off on having a baby,"" Lauren added. ""I would also hold off if they were close to coming out with a vaccine. My main reason for moving forward is that I don't feel like I have the luxury of time at my age.""A major challenge faced by women and couples grappling with such issues is that it's not entirely clear to experts how much of an issue Zika might be in the United States (a large outbreak seems highly unlikely), or how long men and women should wait before trying to conceive if they've been exposed to the virus. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine says that women who have symptoms of Zika should wait for eight weeks before attempting reproduction. For men, it's six months. Anyone possibly exposed to the virus, but not showing symptoms, should also wait eight weeks. But as Ali Watkins, a Buzzfeed correspondent, detailed in her first-person account of being infected the virus in Mexico, the fact that experts are still scrambling to understand Zika means that advice can be contradictory.""My doctor told me if I do indeed test positive for Zika, I shouldn't get pregnant for three years,"" she wrote. ""The CDC, meanwhile, said I would have to wait only eight weeks. How long did the disease stay in my system? Not sure, and scientists don't even know yet.""The good news for men and women in the United States is that while there are certainly no guarantees, not one medical group has said it's necessary for potential parents-to-be who haven't been exposed to the virus elsewhere or by a sexual partner to hold off on trying to conceive. That's very different than the situation in countries that have been hit hard by the virus and where health officials are desperately torn about what to tell women, in many cases urging them simply to wait. ""Basically, the situation is that at this point there's very little risk right now of being affected by a mosquito,"" said Dr. James Segars, chair of the ASRM's Zika working group. ""In the U.S., the risk for mosquito-borne illness is relatively small, if not negligible, as long as [a person is] working primarily inside and uses precautions,"" he added.That is Samantha's game plan. Though she thought, momentarily, about putting her pregnancy plans on hold, a large age gap between children is simply not what she had envisioned for her family, so she has gone off the pill.Claire is going a different route. She and her husband aren't actively trying at the moment, and they may not necessarily start before they move down South. In that case, given the higher temperatures and humidity that make that area a fertile ground for mosquitoes, she says it feels right for them to wait.""At this point, we feel that if we don't have another child up here in Indiana, then we should just wait until a vaccine is developed for Zika,"" she said.Like most things when it comes to family planning decisions, it's complicated. * Name has been changed to protect anonymity","huffingtonpost","left","16947","zika",1061
"This story originally appeared in the Washington Post:Stung by criticism that the world's response to the Ebola epidemic was halting and disjointed, officials in Latin America, the United States and Europe say they are determined to do better against a new foe that, in some ways, is more daunting than the hemorrhagic virus that killed 11,000 people in West Africa.But their efforts are being hobbled by a fundamental lack of understanding of a disease that has spread to nearly three dozen countries and is moving so quickly that some experts estimate it could infect as many as 3 million to 4 million people within 12 months.Unlike the highly lethal Ebola, which had been studied extensively by the time it emerged in Guinea in late 2013, Zika wasn't considered a menace. Most infected people didn't even show symptoms. For decades, Zika got little scrutiny before showing up in Brazil in May.Now, for the first time, Zika is suspected of being the culprit behind a constellation of devastating birth defects, most notably microcephaly, a rare condition in which babies are born with head and brain abnormalities. In adults, the virus has been associated with another rare condition, called Guillain-Barré syndrome, that can result in paralysis and even death. But, even at this point, scientists are not able to say definitively that Zika is the cause of the problems.The mystery surrounding the virus - officials aren't sure what will turn up next - makes it ""much more insidious, cunning and evil"" than Ebola, said Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who helped coordinate the organization's Ebola response and is now leading the Zika effort.Read the full story at the Washington Post.","breitbart","right","16846","zika",279
"Public health officials are growing more and more concerned about the Zika virus as its true impact in South and Central America becomes clear. In January, the World Health Organization said Zika could be on the verge of spreading throughout the Americas. Health organizations in the U.S. are upping their efforts to develop a vaccine and eradicate the virus, and the White House has asked that money be appropriated to help make this happen.But as certain as death and taxes, Republicans in the House of Representatives have emerged to slow this process to a crawl. GOP lawmakers have met these calls to action with indifference masquerading as fiscal responsibility. Congressional action on the issue has stalled, and the only alternative for those who want to fight a Zika outbreak is to subtract funding from other pressing priorities.In one sense, this isn't surprising. For years, House Republicans have made a habit of bumbling from one crisis to the next without a plan (unless you count ""shut down the government"" as a plan, and you shouldn't). But the response to the Zika virus seems deeply strange when you think about the Ebola outbreak of 2014, when Washington lawmakers fell all over themselves to take action.Don't get me wrong: It's good that Zika hasn't touched off the kind of wild-eyed fearmongering that we saw with Ebola. But some officials have gone way too far to the other extreme, with House Republicans essentially shrugging off an issue they really ought to take seriously.Ebola is a horrifying sickness that's brought real devastation to West Africa, but Americans' panic over the virus never quite matched up with the facts. Yes, Ebola has proven hard to eradicate. We don't have a vaccine yet. And once a person contracts the virus, treatment is difficult, sometimes impossible. People with Ebola often die brutal, harrowing deaths.At the same time, the virus is quite cloddish, epidemiologically speaking. It spreads primarily through body fluids -- and while it can travel via saliva in certain circumstances, it's much more commonly transmitted through blood, feces and vomit. The disease is at its most beastly in environments that lack basic sanitation and hygiene. It's likeliest to spread among people who live in such conditions, and among the medical professionals who treat them. The front lines of the war on Ebola are in West Africa.When the disease came to the U.S. two years ago, things unfolded in a textbook manner. A Liberian national named Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas, and two of the nurses who treated Duncan contracted the disease as well. (A physician with Médecins Sans Frontières, returned to New York City after assisting with the concurrent Ebola outbreak in Guinea, also contracted the disease during this time.) In the end, Duncan succumbed to the disease while the rest of the afflicted survived.Zika isn't as deadly as Ebola, but it could pose a far worse problem than Ebola ever did. It's primarily a mosquito-borne virus (though it can also be transmitted sexually), which means it can spread much faster than Ebola, and it's often asymptomatic. The most dangerous thing about Zika is that it can lead to severe birth defects, such as microcephaly, in the fetuses of pregnant women who contract the virus. It can also cause an auto-immune disorder called Guillain-Barré syndrome. These are serious conditions that alter people's lives and put long-term strain on the health care system.As The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported last month, Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Ed McCabe, medical director of the March of Dimes, have given lawmakers some specific warnings with regard to Zika:""Without additional resources we won't be able to get the resources we need to get to the state and local levels to provide Americans with the protection they deserve,"" Frieden said.Congress has said the CDC should use any remaining Ebola funds to fight Zika, but Frieden and others said that would not be sufficient.""Shifting money from crisis to crisis will have us chasing our tails,"" said Dr. Ed McCabe... ""We have a few short months to stop Zika from gaining a foothold in the U.S. If we don't the consequences will be dire.""But a lot of people on Capitol Hill don't seem to care.The Senate has been more active than the House in helping public health officials confront Zika's potential onslaught. As The Hill reported last week, Republicans in the Senate are working with their Democratic counterparts to direct money toward anti-Zika efforts. Democrats in both chambers are backing President Barack Obama's request for funding. And many lawmakers in the South -- the region that might first bear the brunt of a Zika outbreak -- seem to understand the need to be proactive on this issue. (Florida Senator Marco Rubio has been a key ally in the effort to secure the $1.9 billion requested by Obama.)The Senate is closer to passing a $1.1 billion bill -- a move that House Democrats are threatening to oppose for being half a loaf. But Democrats in the House still seem to grasp the seriousness of the situation better than Republicans, who appear more or less content to kick the Zika can down the road to October, when the request for funding might be considered as part of the normal appropriations process.The views of the House GOP caucus can be summed up by the remarks of Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). Per CBS News:Cole chairs an appropriations subcommittee considering the administration's request.""We do believe the NIH, and we do believe the CDC,"" Cole told CBS News. ""But have to use the resources that we have wisely.""Cole added he wasn't ""going to put a date on it,"" but expected more funds to be available ""before the end of the fiscal year,"" which is October 1.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), though, has pointed out that waiting until October to move on Zika funding would actually mean waiting a lot longer than that:""We need the money now,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told CBS News. ""The budget process takes a long time -- it will be practically nine months before we could get any other money, and there's no guarantee that you have the money at the end of the year.""House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), though, has endorsed the idea of waiting. ""The money's in the pipeline,"" he told CBS last month. ""Our appropriators are going to address this issue -- if the need ever arises, our appropriators will address it in the appropriations process.""When Ryan mentions ""money in the pipeline,"" he's talking about funds that have already been allocated to fight the Ebola crisis. Obama has, in fact, diverted some of this money to fight Zika as a short-term stopgap. But administration officials have warned that this won't be enough to combat a Zika outbreak. And public health officials say that depriving the Ebola eradication effort is going to ""set back work in West Africa"" and delay the development of a vaccine.The interesting thing about this Ebola funding -- the money that House Republicans say could be easily diverted to mount an attack against Zika -- is where it came from in the first place. Its roots lie in an earlier era, when a more motivated House GOP aimed to demonstrate its responsiveness in the face of an emerging crisis. Back then, congressional Republicans didn't delay or dither, as they are doing now. In fact, they crowed about how active and involved they were, and frequently accused the White House of being unprepared and slow to respond.Back in October 2014, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) seemed to grasp what needed to be done to fight the Ebola virus. ""We've got to go to the core of the problem, solve it there and invest in a vaccine and a treatment to cure it once and for all,"" he said during an appearance on ""Face the Nation."" McCarthy pointed out that his caucus was working with the Obama administration to secure timely allocations of money to spur the fight. As he put it, the ""safety of the troops"" was one of the paramount concerns.And McCarthy was eager to brag about how House Republicans were responding. On Oct. 16, 2014, he approvingly retweeted a ""list of actions House committees have taken in response to the Ebola outbreak"" from then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), lest anyone think House Republicans weren't taking the matter seriously.Those actions included a short-term continuing resolution with provisions for Ebola containment, a $50 million appropriation to ""support Operation United Assistance, the Department of Defense-led mission to combat the Ebola outbreak,"" a $700 million appropriation to the same effort two weeks later, and numerous hearings and statements pertaining to the U.S. public health response and global efforts. There was no foot-dragging, no talk of delay. Now, however, McCarthy's sense of urgency is nowhere in evidence. As The Hill reported last week:Leaders of appropriators in the House and Senate have said publicly that they want to provide funding to fight Zika, but they are increasingly divided over how it is structured and whether it can wait until later this year.On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said he would prefer to handle the funding through the regular appropriations process, pushing the debate over emergency dollars until the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1.It was bad enough that McCarthy was ruling out emergency measures, but as Politico further noted, pushing the question of Zika funding to October only creates further uncertainties:It's unclear what legislative vehicle a Zika deal would hitch a ride on. Republicans typically prefer to make such allocations in the annual spending bills, per McCarthy's Tuesday statement. But it is unclear that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will be able to pass appropriations bills on the House floor given steadfast conservative opposition to spending levels.There's also a question of whether the money will be pinned as ""emergency"" spending, which allows appropriators to ignore budget caps that constrain other types of spending. McCarthy deferred on that question Monday. And he wouldn't say whether the new spending would be offset, as conservative groups have demanded.And what of Ryan? In 2014, he was quick to urge officials to ""stay ahead of the Ebola outbreak."" He was equally quick to criticize the White House's efforts, calling the appointment of Ron Klain as ""Ebola czar"" an ""inside, crony type of selection."" (Klain actually ended up doing an admirable job.) At the time, it was reported that Ryan was mainly concerned about the government's competence.Now, Ryan's endorsed the view that the money appropriated to fight Ebola would be better spent on Zika -- an approach that essentially transforms the response on both fronts into sad half-measures that have public health experts worried. ""The administration has a bit of a track record of over-requesting,"" Ryan has said, failing to mention how his own colleagues, during the Ebola crisis, made sure such requests got fulfilled and were happy to take credit once they were.Although his current plan basically comes down to ""rob Ebola to pay Zika, and fall short in both cases,"" Ryan is casting his approach as evidence of shrewd leadership. But the speaker actually has a record of helping to deny public health professionals the tools they need.Sequestration cuts came as a bitter blow to public health agencies in 2013. Those cuts forced the National Institutes of Health to slash its budget by $1.55 billion, and subtracted $13 million from the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, which has been leading the U.S. effort to eradicate Ebola in West Africa. The CDC ended up recovering some of those funds a year later. But as The Huffington Post's Sam Stein reported, Ryan's budgeting has injured the CDC in ways that go beyond just sequestration:If you move back the timeline a bit, you see that investment in the CDC has still fallen dramatically. The agency's current budget, in fact, is nearly $600 million lower than it was in 2010.While some of the funding was restored after the budget agreement between the House and Senate in early 2014, ""there is still a gap between FY14 and FY10,"" the Senate aide noted.House Republicans may not understand this, but they're taking a huge chance on at least one public health crisis right now -- possibly two. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) declared last week that ""the Ebola battle is now completed"" -- a claim for which there is no real basis. And as Politico's Dan Diamond reported, when Obama was forced to to divert funding from the Ebola fight to help prop up the Zika response, House Republicans took a ""victory lap"":""We are pleased to hear today that federal agencies are heeding our call,"" House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Kent.) said in a statement. ""These resources -- which the agencies already have on hand -- will help stop the growth of this devastating disease around the world, and prepare for and protect against outbreaks within our borders.""Rogers is signing his name to a number of promises while simultaneously starving the efforts to deliver on them. He'll be among those with much to answer for if Zika gains a foothold in the U.S. or if Ebola re-emerges as a potent threat.As medical experts learn more about the Zika outbreak, their anxiety has only escalated. As USA Today reported last month, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, says that Zika has ""been linked to a broader array of birth defects"" and has a greater ""potential geographic range"" than previously believed.""Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought,"" Schuchat said. She was seconded by Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who said, ""I'm not an alarmist and most of you who know me know that I am not, but the more we learn about the neurological aspects [of Zika], the more we look around and say this is very serious.""According to a report recently published by the United Nations' High-Level Panel on the Global Response to Health Crises, ""the high risk of major health crises is widely underestimated, and the world's preparedness and capacity to respond is woefully insufficient."" It's precisely for this reason that Frieden, the CDC director, wants to act against Zika now. To that end -- and with the support of the White House -- he's asked Congress to ""approve a $1.9 billion request from the White House, $828 million of which would go to the CDC's Zika effort.""It really is amazing to compare the current situation to 2014. Then, lawmakers were ready to establish travel bans and quarantine medical professionals in the name of stopping Ebola. They demanded a czar and then lambasted the one they got. Most importantly, in less than a three-month span between Sept. 30 and Dec. 10, Congress managed to pony up $5.4 billion for the medical community to fight the disease.Now, House Republican leaders are dilly-dallying, taking an incredible gamble with public health and courting a potential crisis that their colleagues in the Senate, their Democratic counterparts, the White House and the public health community all believe can and should be thwarted by acting now, before it's too late.How, exactly, will we know when it's too late? Amy Pope, the White House's deputy homeland security adviser, said earlier this year that ""if we wait until the public is panicking, until we see babies being born with birth defects, we have waited too long."" Should things get to that point, one imagines the finger-pointing and the excuses, at least, will come as quickly as anyone could want.","huffingtonpost","left","16926","zika",2664
"The World Health Organization said Monday it wants to fast-track a better test for the Zika virus as dozens of countries cope with yet another scary pandemic, saying doctors on the front lines should at least be able to single out the disease from similar infections in hard-hit Latin America.Its emergency committee asked companies to submit their diagnostic ideas so they can deploy kits to Brazil and 25 other countries afflicted by Zika, which typically causes mild illness but has been linked to a sharp uptick in the number of children born with abnormally small heads - a condition called microcephaly.With the first case of sexual transmission confirmed in the U.S. last week, the White House announced Monday that President Obama will request $1.8 billion in emergency funding to fight Zika at home and abroad, saying the virus' threat requires a double-barreled approach that blitzes mosquito populations while chasing a vaccine.His plan earmarks $200 million for a potential antidote and more reliable diagnostics for Zika. Current tests detect antibodies for Zika that ""cross-react"" with related viruses such as dengue, meaning the results aren't definitive, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director for infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health.""We need to get a very specific diagnostic to tell a woman, particularly who is pregnant, have you been infected with Zika or not,"" he said. ""That's going to be very important, and we're working very closely on that.""Zika is a little-known virus that festered for decades in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region before globe-hopping to Latin America, where it has spread to more than 20 countries.A half-million infections have been reported in Brazil since the outbreak began in spring of last year, with a single northeast state - Bahia - accounting for 56,000 cases between April and October alone, the WHO said.""Due to the magnitude of the outbreak, Brazil ceased counting cases of Zika virus,"" the WHO said in its first situation report since deeming Zika a public health emergency.Colombia is second, with more than 20,000 cases reported through late January.While Zika isn't actively transmitting in the U.S., travelers have brought the virus back with them, and there has been a documented case of sexual transmission in Texas. And as temperatures rise in the summer, the U.S. will be at greater risk of transmission from mosquitoes - particularly in the Southern states.For now, the U.S. is advising pregnant women to defer visits to the affected countries, or to at least take precautions against mosquito bites if they must travel.""We're not canceling spring break. We're telling people who are pregnant, 'You know, you may not want to go,'"" said Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control.The CDC last week cautioned that pregnant women whose male partners have visited Zika-affected areas should either use condoms or abstain from sex until their pregnancy is done.The Obama administration said it doesn't want to divert funding from the lingering fight against Ebola, so it will need new funds from Congress for the Zika fight.Mr. Obama's proposal to inject nearly $1.5 billion into the Department of Health and Human Services would, among other things, help the CDC monitor and track suspected cases of Zika in the U.S.It would also study the suspected link between Zika and both microcephaly and Guillain-Barre - a syndrome that can cause temporary paralysis - while promoting the race for a vaccine.The WHO said Monday that ""at least 12 groups"" are working on a potential vaccine. Though a fully licensed vaccine could take a few years, research on similar ""flaviviruses"" such as dengue and yellow fever will serve as a springboard for the effort.Mr. Obama wants $250 million for Puerto Rico's Medicaid program to help pregnant women and others affected by active transmission of Zika on the U.S. territory. The island is steeped in a financial crisis, and it needs Congress to loosen caps on its Medicaid program so it can respond to emergent threats, according to the White House.The administration also requested $335 million to support the U.S. Agency for International Development's efforts abroad and $41 million for the State Department to support U.S. citizens in affected countries.Leading Democrats swiftly backed the administration and piggybacked on the proposal to request relief funding for families afflicted by the ""man-made"" water crisis in Flint, Michigan.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said he is committed to the Zika fight but needs to hear more at a Tuesday briefing from administration officials.Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers, said the panel ""will carefully review the request once it is received.""At least one House Republican - Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida - said he supports emergency funding to fight Zika.""We need to get ahead of this emerging threat,"" said Mr. Buchanan, whose home state is particularly susceptible to mosquito populations that seek out warm climes.The American Public Health Association also backed the request, saying ""new threats require new investments."" ","washingtontimes","right","16839","zika",843
"Two law professors from the nominally Catholic Georgetown University have published an article on a university website this week calling on the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend birth control and abortion in response to the Zika virus outbreak in South America in order to ""truly respect the dignity and health of women of childbearing age.""The authors state that it is ""critical"" that countries be required ""to respect, protect, and fulfil women's health-related human rights, including reproductive rights,"" which include ""accessible, affordable, acceptable, and quality abortions.""The article, titled ""The WHO Must Include Access to Birth Control and Abortion in its Temporary Recommendations for Zika-Associated Public Health Emergency of International Concern,"" was posted on Georgetown University's O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law blog website.Lawrence O. Gostin, faculty director of the O'Neill Institute and university professor at Georgetown, and Alexandra Phelan, an adjunct professor in global health law and doctoral researcher with the O'Neill Institute, coauthored the piece.""The Director-General's Temporary Recommendations should include a directive to countries to ensure that women at risk of Zika virus infection have access to birth control and safe abortion,"" the article states.Pro-abortion groups are already seizing on the Georgetown publication as a further justification for their crusade to have abortion-on-demand legalized throughout Latin America.In its advocacy of abortion as a solution to the Zika health crisis, Georgetown joins the international abortion giant Planned Parenthood, which is exploiting fears surrounding the Brazilian Zika crisis to push for the relaxation of abortion laws in Brazil and elsewhere.Though Georgetown boasts of being ""the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institute of higher learning in the United States,"" it has repeatedly come under fire for having sacrificed its integrity and Catholic identity on the altars of the secular academy.William Peter Blatty, author of ""The Exorcist"" and a graduate of Georgetown University, submitted a petition to the Vatican in 2013 asking church officials to strip his alma mater of the labels Catholic and Jesuit because it had abandoned its Catholic identity.The Catechism of the Catholic Church, in fact, declares abortion to be ""gravely contrary to the moral law"" and is one of the very few offenses that incurs automatic excommunication.Earlier this week the Brazilian Conference of Catholic Bishops said that there is ""no justification whatsoever to promote abortion"" as part of the response to the Zika virus, and made clear that the promotion of abortion ""in the cases of microcephaly, as, unfortunately, some groups are proposing to the Supreme Federal Court"" shows a ""total lack of respect for the gift of life.""""Nothing justifies an abortion,"" said the Rev. Luciano Brito, spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Olinda and Recife in Brazil.

"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday tentatively approved a British company's request to release its genetically modified mosquitoes in the Florida Keys, a trial aimed at slashing the number of insects that carry Zika virus.Officials said the company, Oxitec, cannot perform its field test until the FDA digests public input and makes a final ruling. But for now, the agency said the proposal did not appear to pose a significant risk to humans and the local environment.""The consequences of escape, survival, and establishment of [the modified mosquitoes] in the environment have been extensively studied: data and information from those studies indicate that there are unlikely to be any adverse effects on non-target species, including humans,"" the FDA said in a statement of preliminary findings.The effort is part of broader attempts to eradicate the pesky Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika, which is blanketing Latin America and spreading locally in Puerto Rico.Though many people do not show symptoms, the virus has been linked to serious birth defects and a syndrome that can cause paralysis.""The more we learn about Zika in pregnancy, the more concerned we are,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Thursday.The World Health Organization recently called for additional field trials of genetically modified mosquitoes, as it prods Zika-affected nations to explore both old and new methods of mosquito control.Oxitec reported in January that its modified male aegypti, which mate with wild females to produce offspring that do not survive into adulthood, were able to reduce wild mosquito larvae by 82 percent during trials in Piracicaba, Brazil, in 2015.According to the FDA, the company would produce eggs of the modified mosquitoes in Oxford, England, and ship them to Marathon, Florida, for rearing in the lab before they are released down in Key Haven, Florida.""We look forward to this proposed trial and the potential to protect people from Aedes aegypti and the diseases it spreads,"" Oxitec CEO Hadyn Parry said.Scientists say female mosquitoes do not seek new male partners after they've mated once in their short lifespans, so techniques that leave them with unviable offspring trim down the overall population.On its website, Oxitec acknowledges that there ""of course remains a small possibility, as with any new technology,"" of unforeseen consequences.But the company insists that its upside far outweighs any potential risks, and that it is targeting aegypti mosquitoes that are invasive to this part of the world, anyway.The modified mosquitoes would die off within a few days, and wild-type aegypti would be expected to return to normal levels after the trial.Also, the FDA found that ""it is highly unlikely that release of [modified] male mosquitoes would contribute to the increase in transmission of dengue or other diseases transmitted by mosquitoes,"" as the males do not bite people or other animals.In the meantime, officials have been urging people in affected areas to wear insect repellant and long-sleeved clothing, and to wipe out areas of standing water where the mosquitoes breed.The CDC also advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Zika-affected countries if they can. Studies have shown a dramatic surge in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads - a condition known as microcephaly - to women who've been infected.""Puerto Rico remains a great place to visit, as long as you're not pregnant,"" said Dr. Frieden, who recently visited the island to get a firsthand look at its Zika response.He said the island is on the ""front line"" of the battle against the virus, and risks seeing hundreds of thousands of Zika infections before the year is over.Fearing the situation could get much worse, President Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding from Congress to address the Zika outbreak at home and abroad, though House Republicans have told the administration to use leftover Ebola funds first, causing scientists to complain their agencies are being stretched thin.""Funding from Congress is urgently needed,"" Dr. Frieden said.Though Zika is not transmitting locally in the states, there have been nearly 200 cases among travelers returning from affected areas, plus cases of sexual transmission to partners.The outbreak is also affecting the U.S. military.Navy Adm. Kurt W. Tidd, commander of U.S. Southern Command, told reporters this week that two servicemen - in Brazil and Colombia - were diagnosed with Zika. They've both gotten over the virus and returned to duty.Also, a pregnant female service member in the region took advantage of a military policy that allowed her to return to the U.S. earlier than planned - a precaution to avoid Zika.""This was just a very slight acceleration to an already scheduled departure,"" Adm. Tidd said. ","washingtontimes","right","16871","zika",797
"GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn speaking at the ""Iowa Freedom Summit"" last year.The GOP obsession with shutting down Planned Parenthood is now threatening to stymie research into cures for diseases like Parkinson's and the Zika virus. Researchers who study those illnesses rely on fetal tissue and they fear the House GOP's investigation into how they acquire the tissue will unleash volatile anti-abortion forces on both them and the research. Gardiner Harris reports: A special House committee empaneled to investigate fetal tissue research is preparing to issue 17 subpoenas to medical supply companies and laboratories, seeking the names of researchers, graduate students, laboratory technicians and administrative personnel - and prompting charges of intimidation.Abortion rights advocates and some university officials say the House investigation into how some of the nation's most prestigious universities acquire fetal tissue threatens to endanger the lives of scientists, doctors and their staff members. The new subpoenas will only escalate a battle that some researchers fear could shut down studies seeking cures for Parkinson's disease, the Zika virus and other illnesses.Let's face it, they have every right to be scared.

"International Planned Parenthood Federation in the Western Hemisphere region (IPPF/WHR) is seemingly taking advantage of the Zika outbreak in the Americas, the hardest hit region by the mosquito-borne virus, to ask for donations to expand access to abortions and birth control.As of 6 p.m. (ET) on Monday, IPPF/WHR was featuring a picture on its official webpage of a mosquito with the words, ""Emergency: Zika virus is Spreading"" superimposed over the image and a link to page, titled ""Zika Virus: Make Your Emergency Gift,"" that asks for preset donations of $50 to $500, with the option of giving any amount.""In a region where many women have limited or no access to birth control and 6 countries ban abortion under all circumstances, the stakes are high,"" states Western Hemisphere branch of the U.K.-based IPPF on its Zika donations webpage. ""Advocates and health providers are concerned women might turn to life-threatening back-alley abortion procedures out of desperation to avoid the devastating birth defects associated with the virus.""""Make your emergency gift today to help IPPF/WHR and our local partners empower women with the family planning resources and quality, non-judgmental care they need to make empowered, informed choices during this crisis,"" it adds.IPPF/WHR refused to respond to Breitbart News's requests for comment.IPPF/WHR has been promoting the expansion of abortions and contraception as a ""comprehensive approach"" to combat the Zika virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that active Zika transmissions have spread to 30 countries and territories, the majority of which are in Latin America and the Caribbean.Transmission of the Zika virus through sexual contact has been confirmed in the United States.Advice from governments, including Colombia, El Salvador, and Ecuador, for women to delay pregnancies because of the Zika link to microcephaly - a neurological disorder that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and developmental problems - is unreasonable, argues IPPF/WHR.""In a region where approximately half of pregnancies are unplanned, and where sexual assault is prevalent, recommendations by governments to delay pregnancies is [sic] not reasonable-asking women to avoid pregnancy without expanding access to contraception, education, and safe abortion services where legal is not sound public health policy,"" says the organization in a blog post featured on its official website.""It is essential to recognize that women have the right to make decisions about if and when they have children,"" it adds. ""However, throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, many women and young people are unable to exercise this right.""IPPF/WHR acknowledges the Latin American and Caribbean region has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world.Nevertheless, it promotes abortion as part of its comprehensive approach to combating the virus.""IPPF/WHR supports a comprehensive, integrated response to Zika, ranging from mosquito control to local and regional health education campaigns to improved access to contraception, safe abortion, prenatal care, and support for parents of children born with microcephaly,"" states the organization on its blog post. ""We strongly recommend strengthening family planning programs and access to safe abortion services.""""In response to the Zika outbreak, IPPF/WHR will build on its network of clinics and community and mobile health programs to increase access to contraceptives and broaden public awareness about the virus,"" it adds. ""This work will be carried out in close collaboration with national governments and other health providers to ensure maximum impact and avoid duplication of efforts. In addition, we will also focus on increasing access to legal and safe abortion throughout the region.""IPPF/WHR claims it is concerned that health authorities in the region fear many women may resort to illegal abortion procedures that threaten their lives.According to its most recent financial statement, the organization spent nearly $5 million on abortion-related expenses in 2014, described as ""activities to eliminate unsafe abortion, to ensure the universal recognition of a woman's right to choose, and to have access to safe abortion.""That means that nearly 20 percent of its total expenditures (about $26 million) was devoted to abortion-related activities.During his first week in office, President Obama overturned the Mexico City Policy, which prohibited U.S. funding for groups, such as IPPF, that promote or perform abortions overseas. IPPF also receives funding from the United Nations, which receives U.S. taxpayer money.The group says it is funded through a mix of donations from individuals, corporations, governments, and NGOs, in addition to other sources.","breitbart","right","16839","zika",748
"The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean, and with the high volume of news about the virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.Here are five updates, opinions and developments to know about now:  Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a life-threatening neurological condition in which the body attacks its own nervous system, are increasing in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname and Venezuela, Reuters reports. While there's still no proven link between Guillain-Barré and Zika virus, scientists believe they may be able to prove a connection in coming weeks. An increase in cases of Guillain-Barré, which can cause temporary paralysis and even death, also coincided with a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013-2014.Activists and women's rights groups are pushing for looser abortion laws following a rise in cases of the birth defect microcephaly among Brazilian babies, but it's a contentious proposition in heavily Catholic Brazil. There's strong anti-abortion sentiment throughout the country, especially among families with disabled children, and in Catholic and Pentecostal churches.  ""I know it's very difficult to have a special needs child, but I'm absolutely against abortion,"" Danielle Alves, whose 3-year-old son has microcephaly, told The Associated Press. Abortion is currently illegal except in cases of rape, if the mother's life is in danger or if the fetus has anencephaly, a neurological birth defect. Wealthy women are able to receive abortions in private clinics, but options for low-income women are scare, especially in rural areas.  A Russian woman who had vacationed in the Dominican Republic returned home with a Zika virus infection, Reuters reports. Her condition is listed as ""satisfactory,"" and her family members do not have the virus. Despite the fact that the Philippines has not yet seen a Zika virus infection linked to this specific outbreak, health minister Janet Garin is advising families to postpone pregnancy if possible until scientists learn more about the disease, reports Reuters. The country's health ministry is also asking Filipinos to avoid places with ongoing Zika virus transmission for fear that they may return with an infection and transmit it sexually to their partners. The last and only time the Philippines recorded a Zika virus infection was in 2012. More than 5,000 pregnant women in Colombia have Zika virus, among a total of 31,555 cases in the country, reports Reuters. So far, there are no reports of microcephaly birth defects linked to Zika virus, but the government is loosening the country's restrictive abortion laws to allow women affected by Zika virus to access the medical service if they'd like. Meanwhile, the virus has also spread in Puerto Rico, where 30 people have confirmed infections, reports LiveScience. No microcephalic births have been linked to these cases. The countries and territories under travel alert by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are: American Samoa, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Samoa, Suriname, Tonga, Venezuela and the U.S. Virgin Islands. ","huffingtonpost","left","16846","zika",721
"Dr. Tom Frieden has dealt with a number of epidemics during his seven-year tenure as director of the Centers for Disease Control. But the rapidly spreading Zika virus, the terrifying birth defects it causes and Congress' inexplicable foot-dragging on funding anti-Zika efforts has him feeling downright desperate. ""Imagine that you're standing by and you see someone drowning, and you have the ability to stop them from drowning, but you can't,"" Frieden told a packed room of reporters and potential donors at the National Press Club on Thursday. ""Now multiply that by 1,000 or 100,000. That's what it feels like to know how to change the course of an epidemic and not be able to do it.""Frieden displayed an unusual level of vulnerability for a public official on Thursday as he begged for more private sector donations and implored a divided Congress to move faster to combat the ""extraordinary and unusually urgent"" crisis.""I'm often asked how I feel as CDC director,"" he said. ""In the heat of the moment, you're mostly concerned about getting the job done.... but for me, when faced with emergencies like this, the greatest emotion has been frustration."" Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that can cause babies to be born with unusually small and deformed heads, is rapidly spreading through South and Central America and has already infected at least 1,500 people in the United States. Frieden said the need to stop Zika in its tracks in the U.S. is more urgent than ever right now, as the weather grows hotter and more mosquito-friendly. But the challenges of combatting Zika are enormous and unusual. First, diagnosing Zika is difficult. Four out of five people affected display no symptoms and the virus only stays in a person's blood or urine for one to two weeks. Second, the type of mosquito that transmits Zika is very difficult to control. Frieden said his researchers put a Zika-infected mosquito in a bottle coated with a strong insecticide, and the insect flew ""happily"" around the jar for hours. ""This is the cockroach of mosquitos,"" he said. ""It lives indoors and out, bites in the day and in the night. The eggs can last more than a year, and they can hatch in a drop of water.... When they take a blood meal, they'll bite four or five people at once, so they're capable of rapidly spreading infection."" Frieden said the CDC needs funding to stop the epidemic in its tracks and protect pregnant women from becoming affected. The agency is trying to confront Zika in Puerto Rico, which because of its climate is particularly friendly to the mosquito, and to support women who choose not to get pregnant right now with effective modern contraceptives. The CDC also needs to develop retroactive tests so that pregnant women can discover whether they've been affected at any point in their gestation. But nearly four months after the CDC first asked for $1.9 billion in funding to deal with the epidemic, Congress just failed to pass a bill to give health officials the money they need and then left for a 10-day recess. Frieden said his ""jaw dropped"" when he realized how long it would take Congress to move on the issue. ""Three months in an epidemic is an eternity,"" he said. The cost for treating just one baby with microcephaly, the birth defect caused by Zika, is estimated to be about $10 million. More than 300 pregnant women in the U.S. and its territories are confirmed to have Zika. Democrats skewered their Republican colleagues Thursday for trying to be ""fiscally responsible"" during a public health emergency. ""We can nickel and dime this if we want, but we do so at our own peril,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.). Frieden said Congress doesn't have time to bicker over funding right now.  ""Memorial Day weekend heralds the start of mosquito season,"" he said. ""We have a narrow window of opportunity to scale up Zika prevention measures, and that window is closing.""    ","huffingtonpost","left","16947","zika",740
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is dispatching two top aides to Puerto Rico this weekend for a fact-finding trip to learn more about the Zika virus, her campaign said on Tuesday.Clinton aides Amanda Renteria and Ann O'Leary will meet with officials on the island territory, which has become a breeding ground for the virus in the United States.In Puerto Rico, there are some 400 confirmed cases of Zika, which is spread by mosquitoes and through sexual contact, and public health experts predict that eventually as many as 80 percent of the island's 3.5 million residents could become infected.Clinton said in a statement provided by her campaign to Reuters that more must be done to combat the spread of Zika in Puerto Rico, which has an abundant mosquito population and also a decades-long recession that has made curbing that population difficult.""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is taking this threat seriously and it has been working closely with Puerto Rico. But I want to be sure that we are truly doing all we can to fight the Zika virus from spreading,"" Clinton said.""Zika is an urgent problem and we need to act now,"" Clinton added.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which now has confirmed more than 1,100 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zikainfections in mothers.CDC director Tom Frieden visited Puerto Rico last month to assess the situation on the island, which is known to have the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the species linked to repeated outbreaks of dengue and now Zika.

While the post is from 2010, Facebook comment activity under it is booming in the past week, with individuals attempting to sell their own frogs and toads to those finding the page through search engines. A used car sales page offers to give away frogs for free.The Argentine media outlet Que Pasa Salta notes that they have found at least one page promising a free gift to those who buy more than five toads to keep around the house. Some salesmen promise their amphibians will ""live 20 years.""Frogs and toads are seen as a natural and potentially more effective method of containing Aedes aegypti populations. Argentine newspaper La Nación reports that Health Minister Jorge Lemus has dismissed fumigation as a solution to the Zika problem, as it kills adult mosquitos but does little to destroy eggs or contain larvae. ""We are working hard to fumigate, but the mosquitos are resistant to the chemicals it is a complimentary method [of containment].""Lemus confirms that Argentina has diagnosed five cases of Zika, ""all imported,"" he notes. ""There is an important number of Argentine tourists in viral circulation zones, like northern Brazil and Colombia,"" he adds. While Argentina is home to the Aedes aegypti, its distance from the Equator makes it a significantly less hospitable environment for the virus during the winter season. Its closest neighbor, Chile, has no known Aedes aegypti population.Lemus has dismissed the possibility of enhancing airport security in Argentina. ""The airport measures do not yield results,"" he notes.The Zika virus is asymptomatic in 80 percent of patients, and the remaining fifth of those diagnosed experience only mild symptoms of infection. The danger in contracting the virus comes from its ties to two other crippling conditions: microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. In Brazil, more than 4,000 infants whose mothers are believed to have contracted Zika have been born with microcephaly, a condition in which their skulls are too small for their brains, causing severe damage. Another minority of adult patients have been diagnosed with Guillain-Barré, a condition that causes severe muscle pain, paralysis, and death. The links between Zika and these two conditions are not yet clear to scientists.In addition to the fight against Zika, Argentines have been increasingly fearful of the more potent Dengue fever infection. The result has been a market in which finding insect repellent is nearly impossible. ""The need to protect oneself against the mosquito 'invasion' has turned into an odyssey in the capital [Buenos Aires],"" La Nación wrote in January. While the government has capped insect repellent prices at $34,99 Argentine pesos, finding the products - particularly the SC Johnson Off! brand - has become nearly impossible.La Nacion writes that perfumeries are much more likely to carry the products than pharmacies. ""We get a box of repellant a week,"" a pharmacy owner told the newspaper, ""I displayed them and they were gone in two hours.""In Brazil and Colombia, where Zika has become a pandemic, military officials are going door-to-door distributing repellant to pregnant women, who are most at-risk for harming their infant through Zika infection.","breitbart","right","16840","zika",634
"WASHINGTON -- As lawmakers prepare to leave for a weeklong recess, Democrats are calling for a vote on emergency funding to combat the spreading Zika virus. Republicans indicated last week they planned to work with Democrats, after weeks of ignoring the administration's request to direct emergency money toward the epidemic. The virus, according to the World Health Organization, causes microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. There have been 388 travel-related Zika cases reported in the U.S. since the start of 2015.On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) urged Republicans to move now, ahead of the brief recess that begins for both chambers on Friday. ""There's been talk about some kind of arrangement, but there is no deal,"" Reid said, adding that the amount Republicans are eyeing (over $1 billion) isn't enough. ""We want $1.9 billion dollars,"" Reid said as he pounded the lectern in front of him while speaking to reporters. ""This is a problem that has to be addressed now.""In February, the White House sent the $1.9 billion funding request to Congress. The administration also asked to redirect to Zika a portion of leftover funds intended to tackle Ebola.""The mosquitoes are buzzing, and I'm not making that up,"" said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). The Senate is currently considering an energy and water appropriations bill, but Democrats are eager to move immediately to Zika funding next. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wouldn't say Tuesday if that was his plan.""We haven't concluded how much or when,"" McConnell said of the final amount and timing of a vote. ""We all are very much aware that this is a serious crisis, and we'll be working on it with the administration and Democrats."" Pressed again on if he had a deadline for moving the emergency funds, McConnell said, ""We're working on it every day.""Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), chair of the subcommittee on health and human services, said he is continuing to work with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on an agreement. ""We are working to find the right number,"" he said. Still, Democrats said that Republicans aren't moving fast enough, and are stalling due to conservatives within their ranks that are opposed to spending more money on Zika. ""Sen. Murray is working with our Republican colleagues, but they can't move anything,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). ""There's no path because you have a hard right group saying 'we don't want to spend money on anything.'""Last week, top U.S. health officials warned that the mosquito that carries the virus is now found in 30 states, and 474 cases of Zika have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That number is expected to rise. ","huffingtonpost","left","16917","zika",478
"Sen. Roy Blunt said negotiators are nearing a deal that would partially fund President Obama's $1.9 billion request for emergency spending to combat the Zika virus at home and abroad.The emerging compromise by Mr. Blunt, Missouri Republican, and Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, would allow senators to vote on $1.1 billion in Zika funding as an amendment to one of the fiscal 2017 spending bills.The package will not be attached to the energy and water bill that is on the floor now.""We should be able to lock that down before too long,"" Mr. Blunt said in a brief interview.For months the White House has pushed for the full $1.9 billion to gird for Zika, a mosquito-borne illness that causes birth defects, saying that is what's needed to develop a better diagnostic test and vaccine for the disease, while boosting mosquito control efforts in the states.It also wants to backfill nearly $600 million it shifted from other accounts to prepare for Zika right now, including $510 million from the fight against Ebola in West Africa.Democrats say they're willing to tack the money onto the record debt rather than cut other programs to pay for it, though House conservatives say the package will hit a wall in their chamber if the money is not offset.Mr. Blunt declined to say whether any of the $1.1 billion would be paid for in the final deal, saying, ""I think we'll just have to see what it looks like.""The talks reflect a deal that senators bandied about last month, though those talks appeared to cool for a while as GOP senators said they didn't want to cut Mr. Obama a ""blank check"" for Zika efforts.The Centers for Disease Control has recorded 426 travel-related Zika cases in the states and the District, including a handful through sexual transmission, though the virus is expected to puncture the mainland once temperatures rise, allowing mosquito populations to flourish.Florida Gov. Rick Scott lobbied for funding on Capitol Hill Wednesday, saying his state will be at the epicenter of any outbreak because of its warm and wet climate.The looming hurricane season will only make things worse, he said, and many travelers will stop through his state on the way to the Olympic Games this August in Brazil, where Zika is swirling and causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads.Mr. Scott said he did not know if $1.9 billion or $1.1 billion was the correct amount to fight the threat. He just wanted Congress to free up money now.""This is an urgent need for our state,"" he said. ""What's important to me is we get together now to get it done.""Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, has called on Congress to fund the full $1.9 billion request so long as all of the money is spent on Zika efforts.Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida became the first House Republican to back the administration's request last week, citing the death of a Puerto Rican man from complications tied to Zika and new research that shows how the virus harms the fetal brain. ","washingtontimes","right","16932","zika",517
"Russia has documented its first case of Zika virus infection after an unnamed woman returned from a trip to the Dominican Republic.""The person with the virus is currently at an infectious diseases hospital, her condition is satisfactory,"" declared Rospotrebnadzor, the Russian consumer watchdog group. ""Medical observation of family members was established, no clinical manifestations of the virus were registered among them, and they tested negative for the Zika virus.""The confirmation comes a few days after the Russian Healthcare Ministry warned it could hit the country due to travelers.""Zika virus infection cases have not been registered in Russia. Some cases may emerge related to tourist visits to countries that have been hit by the outbreak,"" said spokesman Oleg Salagay on February 12. ""Those cases, though, do no pose the threat of an epidemic because the main transmitter of the virus is a special species of mosquitoes that cannot inhabit most of the Russian territory.""On February 4, Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets assured the country the government will isolate any cases to protect other citizens.""We have worked out serious measures to control viruses entering Russia, so now we are monitoring so that this virus is not brought to the country. If anything happens, there are all measures to isolate [it] immediately,"" she said.Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations in the Western Hemisphere - Chile and Canada - have recorded populations of the mosquito species living there. They also carry dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya.Despite Salagay's claims, researchers found the mosquito in Sochi, located on the Black Sea. The scientists recommended the country implement control measures ""to reduce the possible risks of importing exotic vector-borne infections, such as dengue and chikungunya.""As the outbreak continues, scientists continue to find different ways to transmit the disease. The Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) confirmed a person received the virus after ""sexual contact with an individual with Zika.""""Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,"" explained Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director. ""Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any sexually-transmitted infections.""Harvey Stern, medical director at Fairfax Cryobank, told USA Today that scientists do not ""know how long the Zika virus can survive in semen, or whether the virus is present in the semen of men without symptoms.""Brazilian scientists also detected live Zika virus in human saliva and urine, which may indicate that a person in contact with these bodily fluids can contract the virus.""I think we need to be careful that don't we jump to any conclusions about transmissibility,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""When you find a virus or fingerprints of a virus in a body secretion, it absolutely does not mean that it is transmitted that way.""Saliva can hold HIV, but cannot spread the disease.Others said the ""low levels"" can make it ""impossible or unlikely"" to transfer to another person. Substances in the saliva could also prevent transmission.""I think it's important to step back and emphasize that Zika is a mosquito-borne virus and the overwhelming majority of cases are spread by mosquitoes,"" stated Thomas Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).In late January, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian scientists to develop a vaccine for the virus. The scientists hope to patent one by March.Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the country wants the vaccine because officials desire ""a full inventory of vaccines"" and to ship it to countries impacted by Zika.Experts believe a fully legalized vaccine is still a decade away. Researchers hope, though, to have an emergency vaccine by the end of the year.""This vaccine is easy to produce. It could be cranked to very high levels in a really short time,"" said Canadian scientist Gary Kobinger.Two groups currently working on the vaccines want to begin human testing in August. Kobinger anticipates the human tests will be good enough for governments to ""allow the use of it in emergency situations.""On Friday, Brazil and the University of Texas signed an agreement to develop a Zika vaccine. Brazilian Health Minister announced the government will devote $1.9 million to the research.","breitbart","right","16846","zika",733
"Dr. Arthur Caplan, founding head of the Division of Bioethics at New York University, discussed the Zika threat to the Summer Olympics on Wednesday's Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon.Caplan said he was not certain the safety of the Olympics in Brazil could be guaranteed. He is one of 150 experts to sign a letter to the World Health Organization, urging it to pressure Olympic authorities to reschedule the games. ""I wish they would postpone it, or move it to some other location. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to happen. The commercial interests, the amount of money involved, the prestige - I think this thing is gonna go,"" he predicted.Caplan said public health officials still aren't taking Zika as seriously as they should be.""It's partly because what they're saying is, look, Zika's been around in Brazil. Some say it's winter down there, which is true, although winter in Rio is pretty warm,"" he explained. ""I've looked at the temperatures. The mosquitoes like those temperatures just fine.""""The other big problem is, they're focused in on the mosquitoes, but there's a sexual transmission route for this disease,"" he continued. ""What I'm afraid is going to happen is, you'll bring in 500,000 people to a very big party, and they won't protect themselves. They won't practice safe sex, and you'll get sexual transmission going on there, and people will bring it back to their home countries.""He thought Zika had the potential to become a bigger problem in the United States. ""I think the Zika mosquito is coming here. Zika may get here faster if some of our athletes come back infected, and give it to their partners, but that's another problem,"" Caplan warned. ""And then what I worry about is, there are parts of the world that don't have Zika, but if you bring in 500,000 people and some of them go back to these places where there is no Zika, they'll bring it with them. So, yes, I do worry that we could see this thing intensifying, and I still don't believe that we're spending enough money yet on a vaccine or a treatment.""He stopped short of recommending that the U.S. team should be pulled out of the Rio Olympics, but advised ""informed consent,"" plus ""more transparent information about what the risks are, what we know, what we don't know.""""For example, we don't know how long this virus stays in your body,"" Caplan said. ""If you do get infected, when is it safe to try and have a kid, or when can you have unprotected sex again safely? We can't really answer that question yet.""""Don't send women of child-bearing age, don't send anybody who's thinking about having a child. That would be irresponsible,"" he declared, noting that some journalists have begun refusing to cover the Rio Olympics for those reasons, prominently including pregnant NBC anchor Savannah Guthrie.Caplan noted the increasing caution of news networks about traveling into the Zika outbreak region might lead to public-relations and legal trouble down the road, but once the Olympic Games are under way, the glamor and spectacle of the great global event would overwhelm those concerns.""Once the athletes hit the pool, once they start running around the oval track, the focus shifts there, and you know, it's kind of in a way a small miracle. Everybody forgets about everything, and we just appreciate the athletic performances. I'm sure that's what they're betting on,"" he said.

"The mosquito-borne Zika virus has shed light on serious shortcomings in the public health systems of the affected countries, most of which are located in Latin America.On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the explosive spread of the virus in the Americas is an ""extraordinary event"" that constitutes an international public health emergency.The disease has been linked to the neurological disorder known as microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads, and Guillain-Barre, a rare syndrome that causes the immune system to damage nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis.Besides bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the disease could also be transmitted through sexual contact, as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Tuesday. There is no preventing drug or vaccine to combat the virus.An op-ed published by Colombia's El Tiempo points out that, ""worryingly,"" failures in the public health systems in affected countries ""occur in the most basic components,"" such as ""prevention, vector containment, education, community participation, self-care and leadership from local health authorities.""Colombia is the second most-affected country, with an estimated 22,000 confirmed cases.Amid the Zika virus outbreak, Venezuela's public health system totally collapsed, according to news reports.The country's lawmaking body declared a ""humanitarian crisis"" due to a chronic shortage of medical supplies and drugs, reports Argentina's La Nacion, shortly before Zika grew into a major international story.""Government debt to pharmaceutical companies and laboratories has reached an estimated $3 billion, making it difficult to import drugs. The same goes for medical supplies and equipment,"" notes the report.The socialist government of Nicolás Maduro had initially refused to make public the number of confirmed Zika cases in Venezuela, points out La Nacion.However, Luisana Melo, Venezuela's health minister, finally revealed last Thursday that there were 4,700 suspected cases of patients showing Zika-linked symptoms, noting that her department was operating under a ""state of alert,"" reports the country's El Universal newspaper.In El Salvador, the public health system is not faring much better compared to that of Venezuela.El Salvador's system has nearly collapsed, according to an editorial published by an online news outlet named after the Central American country.The opinion piece points out that the Zika virus ""could not have come at a worse time,"" adding that ""public health services have almost collapsed because of clumsy management.""Salvadorian public health officials are ineffective and inexperienced, constantly clashing with doctors and residents, argues the op-ed, noting that the government's debt crisis is the root problem.El Salvador's public health sector is also suffering from a shortage of drugs and professional health officials, adds the article. Like in Venezuela, the president of El Salvador professes to be an adherent of Hugo Chávez's 21st Century Socialism.In Rio de Janeiro, the second-largest city in Brazil, home to more confirmed Zika cases than anywhere else in the world, a union made up of health workers dealing with the virus outbreak on the ground are threatening to go on strike over poor working conditions, a testament to problems within the country's public health system.""The union is demanding better working conditions, as well as uniforms, sunscreen and bug repellent for city workers going door-to-door in hopes of wiping out the mosquito,"" reports The Associated Press (AP).""Sandro Cezar is the secretary general at the city's SINTSAUDE union,"" adds the report. ""He said Monday that the union's 7,000 workers will go on stage if Brazil's health ministry doesn't meet their demands by Thursday. Cezar also warns that more than 220,000 other health workers could later join them in a nationwide stoppage.""A Zika outbreak was identified in northeast Brazil in May 2015, but the health minister at the time, Arthur Chioro, dismissed the discovery, telling reporters that ""Zika virus doesn't worry us"" and calling it a ""benign disease,"" reports The New York Times (NYT).""After that dismissive response, public health experts say that the political upheaval in Brazil - in which [Brazilian President Dilma] Rousseff is fighting impeachment proceedings - weakened efforts to respond to Zika,"" adds the report.The CDC has identified 28 countries and territories, including Puerto Rico, as locations with active Zika virus transmission. Most of those countries and territories are in Latin America and the Caribbean.","breitbart","right","16835","zika",717
"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO, June 22 (Reuters) - Fearing the effects of the Zika virus on their unborn children, pregnant women in Latin America increasingly have sought out abortion pills online from a nonprofit aid agency, a new study has found.The research, published on Wednesday as a letter in the New England Journal of Medicine, is the first to measure the response of pregnant women to Zika warnings in countries where abortion is limited or banned. First detected in Brazil last year, the current Zika outbreak has been linked to more than 1,400 cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect that can lead to severe developmental problems.As the Zika virus spreads through Latin America, several countries, such as El Salvador, advised women to avoid pregnancy, even if their access to birth control or abortion was restricted. The World Health Organization also recently advised couples living in areas with Zika transmission to consider delaying pregnancy.""When you issue these kinds of advisories, but you uncouple them from pathways to safe and legal care, you create a really difficult situation for women,"" said study co-author Dr. Abigail Aiken, a reproductive health expert at the University of Texas at Austin.Aiken and colleagues analyzed requests for abortion services from Women on Web, a nonprofit that provides access to the abortion medications mifepristone and misoprostol, as well as online consultations to women in countries where legal abortion is limited. The group offers the pills in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy to induce a miscarriage.The researchers compared abortion requests made after Nov. 17, 2015, when the region was first warned about Zika's potential risk of birth defects, with expected requests to this same group based on five years of prior data.They found statistically significant increases in abortion requests in seven out of eight countries where Zika is circulating, abortion is limited and the country had warned about the risk of Zika in pregnancy.Requests for abortion medication between November and March 2016 doubled in Brazil, where abortion is outlawed except in cases of rape, when the mother's life is at risk or the child is too sick to survive. Requests rose by 35.6 percent in El Salvador, 36.1 percent in Costa Rica, 38.7 percent in Colombia, 75.7 percent in Honduras, 93.3 percent in Venezuela and 107.7 percent in Ecuador.Jamaica, where women had been advised to avoid pregnancy even before Zika transmission was ever confirmed, was the only country in this group not to see a major increase.""Many of these women felt underinformed and very scared,"" Aiken said, based on an analysis of women's emailed comments to the group.Abortion pills from Women on Web are only offered in the first trimester of pregnancy, which is often too early to confirm whether a fetus has been affected by Zika. Researchers have said signs of microcephaly may not appear until well into the second trimester, when abortion may be illegal in many places, including U.S. states.In Colombia, where nearly 12,000 pregnant women have been reportedly infected with Zika, abortion is allowed when the fetus might not survive after birth - a category that includes microcephaly.However, Dr. Juan Carlos Vargas, research director of Profamilia, a Colombian agency that provides abortion and family planning services, has not seen an increase in requests for abortions. His clinic only provides abortions through the first trimester.Zika can take several weeks to diagnose in Colombia, so women often do not know they have been infected until their second trimester, when they must seek care in public clinics and hospitals, he said. Finding providers to perform the procedure can be challenging, Vargas said.At the same time, requests for fertility services at Vargas's clinic have fallen sharply in the past six months, suggesting that women are actively trying to avoid getting pregnant when they can, he said.Dr. Thomas Gellhaus, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the study underscores the need for legal abortion.""The Zika crisis makes it impossible to ignore that women around the world do not have access to this basic health care need,"" he said.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Bernard Orr)","huffingtonpost","left","16974","zika",711
"Blasting the World Health Organization's (WHO) silence on the Zika virus in Latin America as ""deplorable, incompetent and dangerous,"" professor Amir Attaran writes in the Harvard Public Health Review that there is no way to continue with the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on schedule without exposing millions to the threat of contracting Zika virus.Attaran, a professor at the University of Ottawa, writes in the May issue of the publication that the threat of contracting Zika in Rio de Janeiro appears to have increased, not decreased, in the past few months, and that the more doctors understand the threats associated with the virus, the more dangerous it appears to be.""Simply put, Zika infection is more dangerous, and Brazil's outbreak more extensive, than scientists reckoned a short time ago.  Which leads to a bitter truth: the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games must be postponed, moved, or both, as a precautionary concession,"" he writes. He supports his conclusion by noting that Rio de Janeiro is ""inside the heart"" of the outbreak, with the state of Rio de Janeiro having the highest number of cases nationwide. (Brazil is the epicenter of Latin America's Zika outbreak, with Colombia and Venezuela suffering high numbers of cases, as well.)To eradicate the threat, Attaran notes that scientists must first slow down the spread of the virus to have the time to develop the complex technologies necessary to eliminate it from the population. This, he says, is impossible with an injection of half-a-million foreigners into the population, who will leave the country in two weeks to spread the virus throughout the world. Simply put, he concludes, ""Mass migration into the heart of an outbreak is a public health no-brainer.""Attaran calls proceeding with the games given the threat an unethical stance and saves his harshest criticism for the WHO, which he notes ""has never issued an official statement on Zika and the Olympics,"" and has joined the International Olympic Commission (IOC) in optimistic ""denial"" of the problem.Attaran joins a number of public health experts in calling for the Olympics to be relocated or postponed, noting that precedent exists for such a move. In February, Dr. Art Caplan of the NYU Langone Medical Center told Breitbart News he wholly supported the postponement of Olympic Games until athletes could feel safe traveling to Rio de Janeiro, arguing that traveling there this year would be like holding the Olympics in Chernobyl.The WHO has not budged on its position regarding Zika. Earlier this week, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters that the organization is ""confident"" that the Olympics will be a success, as Brazilian health officials have appropriately managed the reduction of the population of aedes aegypti, the mosquito responsible for transmitting Zika.While Zika is largely asymptomatic in adults, and causes only mild symptoms in those who feel anything at all, scientists have found that the strain of Zika currently spreading through Latin America can cause severe brain damage in unborn children when entering the bloodstream of a pregnant woman. It has also been linked on rare occasions to Gullain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in adults, a neurological disorder causing extreme muscle pain, paralysis, and death.A study published in late April found that, due to travel and migration patterns, as well as the prevalence of aedes aegypti, more than two billion people are at risk of being exposed to Zika worldwide.Athletes have expressed serious concerns with participating in the Olympics. American soccer goalkeeper Hope Solo, who threatened not to participate in the games because of Zika, has announced that she will go, but she will likely not spend much time sightseeing in Rio. ""I'm not sure I'm even going to be leaving the hotel room, outside of practice,"" she told CBS Sports this week.Rivaldo, a Brazilian soccer star who was part of the last national team to win the World Cup, warned tourists against coming to the Olympics this year, arguing that Rio de Janeiro is getting ""more ugly,"" and the combined threats of crime and disease are not worth being part of an Olympics ceremony.","breitbart","right","16932","zika",688
"The UN has demanded Latin American countries give women access to abortions and birth control due to the ongoing Zika virus outbreak in the region.Governments have advised women to postpone pregnancy for at least two years.""How can they ask these women not to become pregnant, but not offer  the possibility to stop their pregnancies?"" UN Human Rights office spokeswoman Cecile Pouilly asked the media.Fear of microcephaly or other complications due to Zika have led many women to choose illegal abortions. Doctors indicate women in all social classes are seeking out these abortions ""in despair over the possibility of deformity."" Some go through with abortions without concrete proof of complications.Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth, causing a small skull. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.""Laws and policies that restrict her access to these services must be urgently reviewed in line with human rights obligations in order to ensure the right to health for all in practice,"" exclaimed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.However, doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester or after birth:Doctors have reported 404 cases of microcephaly in newborns since November. They tied seventeen ""to the Zika virus."" Fifteen of the 404 died, ""with five linked to Zika."" Authorities are investigating 56 other deaths and 3,670 cases.Journalst Ana Carolina Caceres, 24, survived microcephaly and thrived even though doctors told the family she would never walk or talk.""When I read a report about the project by the [Brazilian] Supreme Federal Court to allow abortion in microcephaly cases, I took it personally,"" she told the BBC. ""I felt attacked and offended.""""I grew up, went to school, graduated, and went to university. Now I am a journalist and write for a blog.""Gwen Hartley gave birth to two children with microcephaly, but said the girls live normal lives at ages nine and fourteen.""My girls wouldn't choose to have microcephaly, but I want to reassure parents their children will be so much stronger than they think,"" she said.Hartley urged families with children with microcephaly to connect with others.""It will be hard, and everyone will have to band together,"" she added. ""They'll want to educate themselves on it and a support system is really important. But their children will be the light of their family's lives.""During a lecture, virologist Gubio Soares, who first identified the presence of the pervasive Zika virus in Brazil, suggested that legalized abortion in French Polynesia may have prevented scientists from uncovering a link between Zika and severe infant deformities sooner.Brazil outlawed abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.

We are also launching further studies to determine whether children who have microcephaly born to mothers infected by the Zika virus is the tip of the iceberg of what we could see in damaging effects on the brain and other developmental problems.""Scientists who published the findings in The New England Journal of Medicine said they used long-standing criteria to reach their conclusions.By shifting from a mere hypothesis about Zika to stating that it actually can cause birth defects, they said, officials can be well-equipped to explain its risks and ramp up prevention efforts, including mosquito control and the development of diagnostic tests and a vaccine.The news will undoubtedly heap pressure on the administration and Congress to gird for the threat, which so far has wreaked havoc in Brazil and Latin American countries.

Ryan, Wisconsin Republican. ""No. 2, we will address the situation through the regular appropriations process as the need arises and our appropriators are looking at how to do just that.""The House passed a bill late Tuesday that could speed up the development of a vaccine, though the White House called it a ""rather meager accomplishment.""""In some ways, it's akin to passing out umbrellas in the advance of a potential hurricane,"" press secretary Josh Earnest said. ""So, an umbrella might come in handy, but it's going to be insufficient to ensure that communities all across the country are protected from a potentially significant impact.""Without more funding, the U.S. won't be able to wipe out more mosquitoes and scientists will not be able to create more rapid tests of the disease.""So no, I'm not prepared to give Congress credit for that legislation,"" he said. ""It is a positive step, but it is a far cry from what our public health experts tell us is necessary to prepare for the situation."" ","washingtontimes","right","16904","zika",590
"Officials from the abortion giant Planned Parenthood are taking advantage of fears surrounding the Brazilian Zika crisis to push for the expansion of abortion-on-demand throughout Latin America.A number of recent cases of microcephaly, a condition that causes babies to be born with an abnormally small head and a short life expectancy, have been registered in Brazil and are thought to be possibly related to the mosquito-borne Zika virus.In Brazil, cases of microcephaly have increased from 163 a year on average to more than 3,718 suspected cases since the outbreak, and 68 babies have died, according to the health ministry.Zika takes its name from a Ugandan forest where it was first discovered in 1947 in an ape, with the first human case of the virus registered in 1968, according to WHO. For years it has been of little concern, occasionally producing ""mild"" illness in human populations. Its possible ties to microcephaly in babies, however, have turned the virus into a global concern.Although so far only Brazil has seen a sharp rise in microcephaly cases, Planned Parenthood is targeting other Latin American countries with restrictive abortion laws, such as El Salvador, in hopes of exploiting the crisis to change existing legislation. See their video below:As one report stated, even though Zika's exact link to the rare birth defect known as microcephaly is still unclear, ""warnings from El Salvador, at least six other countries and health officials across the Americas are raising anxiety for millions of would-be and could-be mothers in affected areas.""""What happens in a country where abortion is completely illegal?"" said Angélica María Rivas of ACDA, a Salvadoran partner of Planned Parenthood that agitates for the decriminalization of abortion. ""What can be expected is an increase in the rates of illegal abortions, unsafe abortions and a mental health issue for women.""Even though there have been no confirmed cases of microcephaly in El Salvador, Salvadoran officials are cautioning women not to get pregnant for two years to avoid the Zika virus, a measure that health advocates have called wildly unrealistic.Giselle Carino, deputy director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation's (IPPF) Western Hemisphere Region, called El Salvador's response to the Zika virus ""insufficient at best,"" but said she hopes it will move legislators to reconsider their ban on abortion.In January of 1999, Article 1 of the Constitution of El Salvador was amended to recognize the right to life from the moment of conception.The response to the Zika virus ""needs to be more comprehensive,"" Carino said. ""It can't just be 'Women shouldn't get pregnant.'""""When women are desperate  they will seek out their own solutions,"" said Carmen Barroso, Western Hemisphere director for IPPF. In El Salvador, she said, half of all pregnancies are unplanned.Planned Parenthood Global, which advocates for abortion access internationally, also weighed in on the question.""Governments cannot, on the one hand, discourage pregnancy, while at the same time limiting their commitments to and funding for family planning and access to safe and legal abortion,"" said Dee Redwine, Latin America regional director of Planned Parenthood Global.WHO officials say it may be six to nine months before a correlation between Zika and microcephaly can be established or dismissed. This leaves Planned Parenthood and their Latin American partners a reasonable window of time to try to scare women into agitating for legal abortion.Some 80 percent of people infected with Zika show no symptoms, making it difficult for pregnant women to know whether they have been infected.A further complication stems from the fact that microcephaly typically is diagnosed very late in pregnancy, on average at 28 weeks, when the baby is fully developed, meaning that abortions of these children would be taking place in the third trimester.In its campaign to spread abortion in Latin America, Planned Parenthood has a powerful ally in the United Nations. A 2013 UN agreement called the Montevideo Consensus on Population and Development urges states where abortion is illegal ""to consider amending their laws, regulations, strategies and public policies relating to the voluntary termination of pregnancy in order to protect the lives and health of women and adolescent girls, to improve their quality of life and to reduce the number of abortions.""The UN document makes the absurd claim that the penalization of abortion ""does not reduce the number of abortions"" in the region, while simultaneously suggesting that legalizing abortion will ""reduce the number of abortions.""While Planned Parenthood pushes for more abortion, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said her country must wage war against the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the virus, and efforts there will target the elimination of the insect's breeding grounds, such as stagnant water spots where it lives and reproduces.Follow Thomas D.

"By Stephanie Nebehay and Julie SteenhuysenGENEVA/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Researchers around the world are now convinced the Zika virus can cause the birth defect microcephaly as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.The statement represented the U.N. health agency's strongest language to date on the connection between the mosquito-borne virus and the two maladies.The WHO also reported the first sign of a possible rise in microcephaly cases outside Brazil, the hardest-hit country so far in an outbreak spreading rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean. Neighboring Colombia is investigating 32 cases of babies born with microcephaly since January, and eight of them so far have tested positive for the Zika virus, the WHO said.This number of microcephaly cases reported in Colombia so far represents an increase over the historical annual average of about 140 cases.""Based on observational, cohort and case-control studies, there is a strong scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome), microcephaly and other neurological disorders,"" the WHO said on Thursday.In its previous weekly report, the WHO had said Zika was ""highly likely"" to be a cause.The WHO in February declared the Zika outbreak an international health emergency, citing a ""strongly suspected"" relationship between Zika infection in pregnancy and microcephaly.Although Zika has not been proven conclusively to cause microcephaly in babies, evidence of a link was based on a major spike in Brazil in cases of microcephaly, defined by unusually small head size that can result in severe developmental problems.Brazil's health department this week reported 944 confirmed cases of microcephaly, and most are believed to be related to Zika infections in the mother.Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, was not surprised by the WHO's statement.""The evidence is just so overwhelming,"" said Hotez. He said the link to Guillain-Barre has also been pretty clear.""The only lack of clarity,"" Hotez said, ""is the percentage of pregnant women infected with Zika who give birth to a baby with microcephaly,"" which appears to be much higher than what was seen in a previous outbreak in French Polynesia.While Guillain-Barre is a concern, Hotez said, ""the overwhelming emphasis needs to be on preventing microcephaly in babies.""In recent studies, researchers have seen evidence of the virus in brain cells of stillborn and aborted fetuses. They also have seen signs that the brain had been growing normally, but that growth was disrupted and the brain actually shrank.Scientists have been closely monitoring for possible microcephaly cases outside Brazil to rule out environmental factors in Brazil as a cause. Colombia has been following the pregnancies of women infected with Zika after seeing widespread transmission of the virus since October.The latest WHO report reflects an increase in microcephaly and other fetal abnormalities in Colombia, where 56,477 suspected cases of Zika infection have been reported, including 2,361 laboratory-confirmed cases.The two most important factors that predict where we're going to be start seeing microcephaly cases are presence of the mosquito that carries Zika virus and poverty, Hotez said.He is worried that Haiti will be hard hit. ""The Gulf coast in the U.S. is similarly vulnerable.""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will convene a conference in Atlanta on Friday to prepare for a coordinated U.S. response to Zika. Health officials are girding for an increase of Zika cases, especially in southern states, as the U.S. mosquito season starts.Six countries where Zika is not known to be spreading by mosquitoes have reported locally acquired infections, probably through sexual transmission, the WHO said, naming Argentina, Chile, France, Italy, New Zealand and the United States.To date, 13 countries or territories have reported increased incidence of Guillain-Barre or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection in people with the rare autoimmune disease, it added.(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay, Julie Steenhuysen and Bill Berkrot; Editing by Will Dunham and Grant McCool)","huffingtonpost","left","16891","zika",702
"Fear of the mosquito-borne Zika virus is spurring sales of well-known insect repellents, but companies pushing natural products are hoping to grab a share of the market as well, saying their methods will keep the bugs at bay without the ickiness of traditional sprays.Aromaflage, a three-year-old company, says its fragrances have proven just as effective at deflecting mosquitoes as certain DEET-based repellents in laboratory tests. The bottles retail for $30 to $65 and sport a high-end look that's better suited to cosmetic counters than Wal-Mart shelves.""We saw there was a gap in the market, and we didn't want to be another - quote-unquote - 'natural bug spray,'"" said Melissa Fensterstock, who started the company with her husband, Michael, after they marveled at how locals kept mosquitoes away during their honeymoon to southeast Asia.Alabama-based inventor Robert E. Borland Jr. said Central and South Americans, who are already seeing widespread outbreaks, are clamoring for his vitamin-based skin patch - though demand in the U.S. isn't spiking yet.""If it doesn't have to do with Trump or Hillary, it isn't making the news"" in the states, he said. ""But down there it is really a big deal.""Public health officials say there are already 600 travel-related cases of Zika and warn the virus will soon begin to spread by mosquito in parts of the U.S.The Centers for Disease Control has urged Americans, particularly pregnant women, to cover up and apply insect repellent to avoid bites. The CDC says products containing compounds extracted from natural sources, such as oil of lemon eucalyptus, can deter mosquitoes, though it also recommends popular sprays that contain picaridin or DEET, a well-known substance developed for the U.S. Army in the 1940s.""There is no 'natural' substitute for DEET - it is the first-line repellent and should be used by those seeking to lower their risk of being bitten by mosquitoes,"" said Amesh Adalja, senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Health Security.But some consumers are turned off by DEET-based repellents. They don't like the odd smell and say it irritates their skin, while others are leery of anything that smacks of chemicals, as reflected in the ""buy organic"" trend in supermarkets.""Consumers more conscious about what they're putting on their bodies, what they're putting in their bodies,"" Mrs. Fensterstock said. ""People are looking for more natural solutions.""Daniel Fabricant, president of the Natural Products Association, said the effectiveness of natural and chemical-based repellents varies widely, so people traveling to Zika-affected areas should confer with their doctor before choosing a product.""I think people are choosing some of the natural products because, for better or worse, we live in an age of perception where they say, 'Hey, I don't want to use that anymore,'"" he said. ""There's a faction, too, that just doesn't want to use hydrocarbons, petrochemicals - it's that crowd, too.""The Internet has made it easier for consumers with those concerns to track down options.Searching on Google for terms such as ""DEET-free"" brings up Mr. Borland's BugPatch, which is applied to the skin and seeps vitamin B1, or thiamine, into the bloodstream to repel insects through odors that are released by perspiration.""It gives you 48-hour protection and it's all natural,"" said Steve Giffin, director of operations at Giffin Enterprises, which markets and sells the patch for Mr. Borland.Meanwhile, Aromaflage uses a mix of plant-based essential oils, vanillin and alcohol to create a ""shield"" that dissuades mosquitoes from landing on skin. Its spray was just as effective as products with 25-percent DEET concentrate over the course of two and a half hours, according to lab results from Iowa State University that are posted on the company's website.Aromaflage says it hasn't seen major spike in sales amid the Zika scare just yet, though consumers are asking tougher questions about how the product works.""People are more educated about it,"" Mrs. Fensterstock said.Aromaflage doesn't show up on the Environmental Protection Agency's registry of repellents, which lists effectiveness rates in keeping mosquitoes away.The company said it is exempt from having to register because it is considered a ""minimum risk pesticide,"" though it conducted performance testing so it could make efficacy claims. Its owners may pursue registration in the future, however, to enjoy the upside of having a seal of governmental approval.Other entrepreneurs are just getting started.Dr. Richard Silver, a retired anesthesiologist in Tampa, Florida, launched MosquitoPatch.com to whip support for a scratch-activated patch that releases natural oils of citronella, lavender, eucalyptus and peppermint.He said he hopes to sell enough patches to offset costs for donating his product to poorer, mosquito-afflicted areas that don't have many options.""I think the difference between me and other companies that are doing the essential oils is that I'm not doing it for profit,"" Dr. Silver said. ""For me, it's a feel-good thing."" ","washingtontimes","right","16957","zika",836
"Join us here tonight at 6 PM PT for a live discussion of the town hall with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.Today's comic by Matt Bors is Feel The Burns, Oregon:  More good news for Jimmy Carter: The former president says that a scan of his torso shows no cancer. He had previously been diagnosed with an aggressive form of liver cancer that had spread to his brain. In December, a scan showed four cancerous lesions had vanished after treatment. His doctors are cautiously optimistic, but will start treatment again on February 9 because micro-tumors may not show up on a scan. Carter made the announcement in a phone call from London to reporters in Juba, South Sudan. One of his biggest projects is eradicating Guinea worm disease, something the Carter Center began working on in 1986. The disease is caused by a water-borne worm. Once ingested, it grows over a year into a three-foot-long parasite burrowed into the victim's skin. There is no cure and the infected must wait for weeks as the worm is pulled out by being wrapped slowly around a stick, an excruciatingly painful process. Prevention is the Carter Center's effort. It consists of quarantining victims in thousands of villages, preventing the infected from entering water sources where the parasite can lay its eggs and spread the disease. Thirty years ago, when the Carter Center began the prevention campaign, it is estimated that there were 3.5 million cases of Guinea worm disease in 31 countries. Last year, just 22 cases were confined to South Sudan, Ethiopia, Mali, and Chad. Former judge pleads guilty to ordering non-violent defendant stunned electro-stunned: Robert C. Nalley, a former Charles County (Maryland) Circuit Court judge, pleaded guilty Monday to to deprivation of rights under color of law. He was charged with ordering a stun-cuff be used to zap a defendant who was reading from a statement and would not stop, but was neither acting violently nor trying to escape the courtroom. The former judge could be sentenced to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine, but prosecutors will recommend one-year's probation. A case of sexually transmitted Zika virus has been reported in Dallas:Health officials on Tuesday reported that a person in Texas has become infected with the Zika virus through sex in the first case of the illness being transmitted within the United States amid the current outbreak in Latin America.The unidentified person had not traveled but had sex with a person who had returned from Venezuela and fallen ill with Zika, Dallas County health officials said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued a statement saying lab tests confirmed the non-traveler was infected with Zika. Ned and Constance Sublette's have written A History of the Slave-Breeding Industry in the United States: They point out that most slaves weren't brought by ship to America. Here's from a review of the book published late last year at Pacific Standard: In fact, most American slaves were not kidnapped on another continent. Though over 12.7 million Africans were forced onto ships to the Western hemisphere, estimates only have 400,000-500,000 landing in present-day America. How then to account for the four million black slaves who were tilling fields in 1860? ""The South,"" the Sublettes write, ""did not only produce tobacco, rice, sugar, and cotton as commodities for sale; it produced people."" Slavers called slave-breeding ""natural increase,"" but there was nothing natural about producing slaves; it took scientific management. Thomas Jefferson bragged to George Washington that the birth of black children was increasing Virginia's capital stock by four percent annually. East Coast towns unify for fight against off-shore drilling. Coal production in Kentucky at 62-year low: A preliminary report Monday from Kentucky's Energy and Environment Cabinet said the state put out 61.4 million tons of coal in 2015, down 20.7 percent from the prior year and the lowest volume since 1954.The coal industry in Kentucky had 8,401 people employed at the end of the year, a 28 percent plunge from the end of 2014, and less than half of the 2008 employment figure. On today's Kagro in the Morning show: Wingnut writer GunFAIL update.

"Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston are trying to find out how to control the spread of the Zika virus, and hope to later develop a vaccine. Their work is a coordinated effort with researchers in other countries, like Brazil, to help further control of the virus.Brazil's Ministry of Health, Marcelo Castro, said that plans to develop a vaccine have been started in his country, reported The Lancet, an international general medical journal. The work is planned to start in February and will be done in collaboration with the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, Texas.UTMB has been reported to be the largest research center for arboviruses vaccines.Dengue fever, yellow fever, West Nile virus, encephalitis, and the Zika virus, are all part of the non-exhaustive list of arboviruses. The name ""arbovirus"" is from arthropods, such as mosquitoes and ticks, that transmit these viruses.Dr. Pedro Vasconcelos of the Instituto Evandro Chagas says that a vaccine for the Zika virus will take three to five years to develop. The doctor is a researcher at the Institute, one of three institutes in that country working on the effort. Vasconcelos and his Institute will be collaborating with UTMB.The Minister of Health from Brazil is communicating with officials in the United States, such as Sylvia Burwell, the head of the U.S. Department of Health, reported a Brazilian publication. The goal is to bring American experts to Brazil to work with experts there to determine a course of studies in order to create vaccine and drugs against the Zika virus.Brazilian researcher Pedro Vasconcelos was scheduled to meet with UTMB scientists this week.Dr. Nikos Vasilakis, another researcher at UTMB told KHOU CBS11 in Houston that the university ""is trying to find out how the virus replicates, what it's pathogeny is in humans, and understand how the virus is transmitted in mosquitoes."" He added, ""We need to find a way to control the spread.""Dr. Vasilakis said he believes the vaccine could be years away so the better course is to prevent getting bitten by mosquitoes.Medical experts in Brazil report that more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly have occurred in the nation, and they are diagnosing 200 cases per week, as reported by Breitbart News. This condition occurs when pregnant women get infected with the virus. Their babies are affected by having an abnormally small head, a congenital condition associated with incomplete brain development, as reported by Breitbart Texas.Pro-life groups in the United States have denounced the left's promotion of abortion as a solution to the Zita virus pandemic, reported Breitbart News.Brazilian Health Minister Castro admitted the Zika outbreak is worse than previous reports made it appear.

"Areas predicted to bear the brunt of ZikaOver the past several years Houston has experienced extreme weather events including a major hurricane as well as frequent and devastating  flooding.

"The Obama administration is raising the alarm about the Zika virus, warning Congress and the American people that more funding is needed to respond to the threat posed by the virus.""Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Schuchat warned Americans to prepare to fight the virus, which will inevitably be transmitted to the continental U.S. She also urged pregnant women not to travel to infected areas, adding they should specifically defer travel to the Summer Olympics in Brazil.Representatives from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases were brought to the White House to brief reporters on the disease that threatens pregnant women and their unborn children.""[T]he more and more we learn, the more and more you get concerned about the scope of what this virus is doing,"" warned Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""Bottom line is we still have a lot to learn.""Fauci urged Congress to pass more spending to fight the virus, although he admitted that the CDC had already been siphoning funds from other projects to fund research and send prevention kits to Zika infected areas.""We really do need to learn a lot more, because this is a very unusual virus that we can't even pretend to know everything about it that we need to know,"" Fauci said.The Obama administration has called for Congress to pass $1.9 billion in additional funding for the agencies.But Congress has urged the Obama administration to find funds to fund their research and prevention efforts within their existing budgets, and to draw money from the extra funds passed by Congress to fight Ebola.""We're glad the administration has agreed to our request to use existing Ebola funds to address the Zika epidemic,"" Doug Andres, a spokesperson for Speaker Paul Ryan said. ""If additional Zika resources are needed those funds could and should be addressed through the regular appropriations process.""The House Appropriations Committee has indicated that they will continue to monitor the funding of federal agencies, to assure that they have enough resources.","breitbart","right","16902","zika",384
"Factories are churning out bug spray around the clock as fears of the mosquito-borne Zika virus take hold. Demand has tripled in Brazil, where the virus is already entrenched, and has doubled in the U.S., even though no mosquito-transmitted cases have been recorded in the country.The mere anticipation of a Zika epidemic has sparked a boom in the bug-repellent industry.Mosquito Joe franchises report an increase in business of 50 percent.""Clearly, part of it is Zika,"" said company CEO Kevin Wilson.Health officials say the mysterious virus is causing births of babies with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly, in Brazil and other Latin American countries. It also has been tied to a series of birth defects, a syndrome that can lead to paralysis, and a Puerto Rican man's death from the severe loss of blood platelets.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 426 travel-related Zika cases in U.S. states and the District of Columbia, including a handful through sexual transmission.The virus is expected to puncture the mainland once temperatures rise, allowing mosquito populations to flourish.Pregnant women are being warned against travel to Latin America, and people returning are being urged to use birth control.It is unclear whether and when Zika will start circulating in the U.S. through mosquitoes, as it does south of the border, but companies that make bugs their business say they won't be caught off guard.""Nobody likes to benefit from a crisis, but the other way of looking at it is we're here to help with this crisis,"" Mr. Wilson said.S.C. Johnson, the company that makes Off insect repellent, decided in February to hire additional staff and boost its production to maximum capacity, ""working 24/7,"" to meet anticipated demand.The Wisconsin Pharmacal Co. is dispatching its Coleman brand insect repellent at a rate that matches or even exceeds the fervor around West Nile virus in recent years.""I'd say it's the single largest demand uptick we've seen in years. We are too early in the season to gauge whether or not it'll prove to be unprecedented,"" said Andrew Wundrock, the company's senior vice president for sales and marketing.Spectrum Brands, the maker of Cutter and Repel insect repellents, told investors last week that Zika factored into record quarterly earnings for its home and garden division, while Terminix's parent company reported a surge of interest in the mosquito-control services it introduced 18 months ago.""We can't say whether the Zika conversation will directly impact sales, but we do believe our education and awareness efforts around the potential dangers will encourage our customers to protect their homes and families with mosquito treatments,"" ServiceMaster Global Holdings CEO Rob Gillette told investors Wednesday on an earnings call.Like yellow fever and dengue, the Zika virus is carried primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a nasty day biter that will feast on multiple people in a single bloodmeal.Mosquito Joe tries to stamp out the bugs before they get inside the home by surveying property for standing water where mosquitoes breed and spraying leaves and other mosquito rest stops with a synthetic version of pyrethrin, a compound that chrysanthemums use as a natural defense against insects.The company has 172 locations in 26 states, including 30 franchises in Texas and 20 in Florida. When Southeast franchises speak to clients, ""Zika is one of the first things that come up,"" Mr. Wilson said.Southeastern states are most vulnerable to the aegypti, though researchers in Mexico have found the Zika virus in another species, Aedes albopictus. That breed has an even larger footprint in the U.S., raising the stakes for mosquito-control forces in places as far north as New York City.""I know [Donald] Trump wants to build a wall, but I'm not sure it's going to keep the mosquitoes from coming across,"" Mr. Wilson said of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.Consumers and scientists alike are getting acquainted with the latest global health scare. The Zika virus was discovered in Uganda in 1947 but remained relatively dormant for decades, mainly affecting monkeys, before it hopscotched to Pacific islands in 2007 and to South America in recent years.Mr. Wilson said he has known about Zika for a while because researching mosquito-borne illnesses is part of the job. Now, he is educating prospective clients with a webpage of CDC facts on Zika.Though the facts are daunting, he said, his direct-mail advertising won't change. He vows to stick with his lighthearted tag lines - ""Tired of donating blood on your way to the mailbox?"" - instead of spooking potential clients.""We take what we do very seriously,"" he said, ""but our goal is not to use scare tactics to get people to use our services.""Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, is urging Congress to brush aside partisanship and treat the looming Zika virus ""like a hurricane."" He said his state is depending on resources and specific planning to gird for an outbreak.Florida has recorded more than 100 travel-related cases of Zika, and health officials warn that the disease could puncture the states further once temperatures climb and mosquito populations flourish.President Obama has asked Congress to approve his $1.9 billion request for emergency spending to combat Zika and backfill $510 million in Ebola funding that he has shifted to the burgeoning threat.Yet Republican leaders say the Ebola funding should cover immediate costs and that additional money could be disbursed through this year's appropriations process.Last week, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, Texas Republican, said he doesn't want to give the administration a ""blank check"" to fight Zika, while House conservatives have demanded that any additional spending be offset by budget cuts elsewhere.Mr. Scott didn't suggest a dollar amount in his statement Thursday, though he is adding his voice to those of other Florida Republicans who want Congress to act before Zika hits. The Sunshine State is relatively warm and has significant populations of the Aedes aegypti mosquito.Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, has urged fellow lawmakers to approve Mr. Obama's funding request as long as it's used solely to combat Zika. ","washingtontimes","right","16926","zika",1025
"A new disease with an exotic name, Zika virus, is spreading ""explosively"" around the world. It may be causing babies to be born with shrunken heads and brains. No one has immunity. Experts admit significant uncertainty about how the disease spreads, what symptoms it causes, or just which parts of the population face the greatest danger. And the media is going bonkers. There could not be a more perfect set of conditions for a full blown freak out about a threat that plenty of evidence also suggests may not be that great a threat at all. And that kind of risk reaction can be dangerous all by itself.I'm no expert in Zika virus or infectious diseases. For the scientific particulars, one great source is Helen Branswell of STAT ""Everything You Need to Know About Zika Virus.""  There is also a solid backgrounder in the New York Times (""Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus"")The CDC has an information site.  So does the World Health Organization (WHO). But interestingly, the WHO information site is FAR more measured than the public statements by WHO head Dr. Margaret Chan, who spoke in much more dramatic terms.""Last year the disease was detected in the Americas, where it is spreading explosively,""""The level of alarm is extremely high. Arrival of the virus in some cases has been associated with a steep increase in the birth of babies with abnormally small heads."" ""The possible links have rapidly changed the risk profile of Zika from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions.""Dr. Chan's statements, which almost surely will be widely criticized as poor risk communication, set the world press into a Zika frenzy:Zika Virus 'Spreading Explosively' in Americas, W.H.O. SaysZika virus is here in New YorkZika virus may not be in South Florida yet, but it has the potential to be  Zika virus: Up to 4 million cases predicted But compare that scary headline with what the BBC story says in the second paragraph:""Most will not develop symptoms, but the virus, spread by mosquitoes, has been linked to brain defects in babies.""And compare Dr. Chan's alarmist language (speaking about a global threat) with the comments of Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, describing the risk for the United States, where there have been a grand total of 31 recorded cases of an infectious disease that has been around in many tropical areas (that breed the right species of mosquito) for at least eight years. For the average American who is not traveling this is not something they need to worry about. For people who are pregnant and considering travel to the affected areas, please take this seriously.Dr. Schuchat also did a wise thing with her risk communication. She all but promised there would be more travel-related cases, rather than trying to over-reassure the public (as the CDC was criticized for in the Ebola crisis). But she said that conditions in the United States make it highly unlikely (not impossible, but highly unlikely) there will be a serious outbreak here.Perhaps most importantly, compare Dr. Chan's alarm with the actual numbers from Brazil, one of the first places where doctors noticed a spike in microcephaly, the condition of babies born with shrunken heads or malformed brains. Nature reported on an analysis of the actual numbers: Brazil's surge in small-headed babies questioned by reportIt is not known how common microcephaly has become in Brazil's outbreak. About three million babies are born in Brazil each year. Normally, about 150 cases of microcephaly are reported, and Brazil says it is investigating nearly 4,000 cases.From 150 to 4,000 in one year is a frightening spike on a percentage basis, and certainly cause for alarm. But how much alarm? 4,000 cases of microcephaly out of 3,000,000 babies comes to a risk rate of  0.0013. Tiny. And the study reported by Nature found that, as of Jan. 27, only 270 of the Brazil cases have so far actually been confirmed as microcephaly, and a tenth of the reported cases have so far been discounted as false diagnoses.So the basic facts about Zika virus at this point suggest that even if the worst case is real, the statistical risk, even where conditions are favorable for the spread of the disease, is probably tiny. But the at this point facts are, well, equivocal, which is why public health authorities are responding with due caution, (even though some, like Dr. Chan, are responding with less than cautious language.) And the very fact that there is uncertainty is just one of several psychological characteristics that make the threat of Zika virus feel much more worrisome than the evidence alone suggests.New risks freak us out more than the ones we're familiar with. The way we freaked out about West Nile virus, and have now calmed down about it even though it's still around, provides a good analogy. We are much more concerned about risks to babies than risk to adults. Zika scores high on that risk perception factor too. So does the fact that we have no immunity or vaccines, which means we are powerless... we have no sense of control. Not being able to protect ourselves makes any risk scarier. Uncertainty about the nature of the Zika threat adds to the sense of not knowing what we need to know to protect ourselves, and powerlessness.And the media alarms play a huge magnifying role. The more readily available something is to our awareness, the more space it takes up on our limited radar screen of risk. No matter how measured the stories on Zika virus may be as you get down into the details, (and most are), blaring headlines of ""spreading explosively"" and ""four million possible victims"" (thank you, Dr. Chan) are what we hear and read first and, cautious beings that we are, we tend to be overweight the worst case possibilities of any threat and any reassuring caveats down in the story, if we even read that far, do little to disabuse us of our fears.Let's be clear, and fair. Nobody is panicking. These worries, even if based more on feelings that an objective look at the evidence, are real, and valid, and entirely reasonable. Better-safe-than-sorry precaution is built into the psychology of how we keep ourselves safe. Given what isn't known, only a fool would suggest there is no need to worry.But we also have to worry about worrying too much, about this or any threat, because excessive fear can be risky too, from the choices it leads us to make, or just the harmful effects of chronic stress. So it's worth observing how the Zika outbreak is demonstrating how we supposedly rational intelligent creatures often respond to potential danger with emotion and instinct as much as with objective analysis and reason. Understanding that can help us keep this and any risk in perspective, not freak out, and make more thoughtful, healthier, safer choices.","huffingtonpost","left","16829","zika",1202
"The Florida government has confirmed five new Zika cases, including another pregnant woman. This brings the total number of cases of pregnant women carrying the Zika virus in Florida to four.Just as the previous cases, these people received the virus while traveling abroad. Only four have active symptoms out of the 42 cases in the state.""As of today, five new Zika cases have been confirmed with one in Broward County and three in Miami-Dade County,"" wrote Florida Surgeon General Dr. John Armstrong. ""The fifth new case is a pregnant woman. Of the travel-related cases confirmed in Florida, only four cases are still exhibiting symptoms. According to the CDC, symptoms associated with the Zika virus last between seven to 10 days.""Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency over the Zika outbreak in Latin America last month. He has ""requested 250 additional Zika antibody tests from the CDC"" after he learned about the cases of pregnant women with Zika. The tests allow people ""to see if they ever had the Zika virus."" The majority of people who contract Zika do not experience any symptoms.Zika poses more risks to pregnant women since scientists believe a link exists between Zika and microcephaly, a rare birth defect that occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth, causing small heads. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced that doctors had confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly.""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC Director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of claiming Zika caused the microcephaly cases. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.The French government has confirmed its first sexually transmitted case of Zika. A woman contracted the disease after her partner returned from Brazil.""She showed classic signs of the disease,"" said one French official. ""She was not hospitalised and is doing well.""Officials confirmed the woman is not pregnant.Last week, the CDC announced it is investigating fourteen cases of sexually transmitted Zika in the United States. The Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) confirmed the first sexually transmitted Zika case in the beginning of February. The CDC responded with an advisory for people to take precautions to prevent transmission of the virus. This latest discovery forced the center to issue another Health Advisory Notice (HAN) ""to underscore the importance of adhering to the interim guidance published on February 5."" These include pregnant women asking their male partners about possible Zika contact. They also asked everyone to use condoms until further notice since no one knows for sure how long Zika survives in sperm.""Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,"" explained Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director.

"That mosquito looks tasty.As Republicans were scrambling to shut down the House so they could run away from the sit-in led by John Lewis, they finally passed a bill on Zika funding. The idea that the Republicans would at last support giving some dollars to a dire public health threat may seem like a relief, even if the funds are only a bit over half what was requested-and five months late-but this inviting slice of artificial cheese substance came wrapped around a big poison pill.The bill would restrict funding to Planned Parenthood, and specifically block funds for contraceptives in Puerto Rico. Because when you're battling a disease that causes horrible, life-long birth defects, there's no better way to do it than blocking funds to women's health and keeping people from getting contraceptives. And nothing says ""we care"" like specifically making cuts in the area most affected by the disease.If the Republicans aren't trying to simply be evil when it comes to Zika, they're doing a fantastic immitation.As expected, Democrats shot down this ridiculous bill.The nearly party-line 52-48 vote Tuesday left the Senate short of the 60 votes required to advance the measure. What happens next is unclear.What happens next is that babies continue to die, or to be born with unbelievably awful conditions like microcephaly, and America parents and families continue to suffer. Or Republicans come to the table with a bill that helps American families without taking time to punish women in a way they find amusing.One of these things seems sadly more likely than the other.","dailykos","left","16980","zika",268

They found that almost ""everyone showed signs of a previous infection."" CBS News reports:""Guillain-Barré can be a nightmare for those who have it,"" Dr. Wellington Galvão, a hematologist in the city of Maceió in northeast Brazil, told The New York Times.

"U.S. states and cities need to adopt a different mosquito-fighting strategy to battle the species carrying the Zika virus as an outbreak that started in Brazil heads north with warmer weather in the coming weeks, health officials said on Friday.The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency in February as the virus spread rapidly in the Americas, citing Zika's link to the birth defect microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome, an autoimmune disorder in adults that can cause paralysis.The mosquito species responsible for spreading the virus by biting people lives in and around homes, making traditional evening insecticide fogging campaigns from sprayers mounted on trucks an ineffective option, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said.CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said health departments need to take a ""four corners approach,"" targeting the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes indoors and outdoors as well as focusing on killing both larvae and adult insects.""We think we can at least have significant knockdown and potentially significant disease control,"" Frieden told state and local health officials and others taking part in a ""Zika Action Plan Summit"" at the agency's Atlanta headquarters.Most mosquito abatement efforts in U.S. states target nuisance mosquitoes, those that bite at dusk and ruin picnics and barbecues but pose little public health threat. But Aedes aegypti is a daytime biter that dines exclusively on humans, biting several people in a single blood meal.Aedes aegypti has been dubbed ""the cockroach of mosquitoes"" because it is so hard to kill, Frieden said.""Unfortunately, in some parts of the U.S., it has widespread resistance to some insecticides. But that doesn't mean it's impossible,"" Frieden said.Zika has been linked to thousands of suspected microcephaly cases in Brazil. The virus is spreading rapidly in Puerto Rico, a tropical island territory of the United States that is expected to be hardest hit by the current outbreak.Zika is expected to reach southern U.S. states soon as temperatures rise in spring and summer months. As in Puerto Rico, the main focus of the U.S. plan is to protect pregnant women from exposure to Zika-carrying mosquitoes.Dr. Lyle Petersen, director of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Disease, said U.S. mosquito abatement is handled by a ""patchwork"" of mosquito-control districts that are coordinated and funded locally. Some may not be linked to local health departments.Most of these programs, Petersen said, are ""primarily funded to control nuisance mosquitoes rather than to control disease-spreading mosquitoes.""Surveillance systems in most states and municipalities are geared toward night-biting mosquitoes that breed in larger bodies of water, and are not likely to detect Aedes aegypti, which breeds in flower pots, tires, trash and small pools of water.Unlike many other types of mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti's eggs can dry out and cling to container surfaces, waiting for the next rain to revive them.At the meeting, Petersen showed a map of mosquito abatement districts in U.S. states. One attendee said ""abatement"" in his area consisted of a man with a pickup truck who plowed snow in the winter and did some mosquito spraying during warmer months.Many officials expressed concerns about the cost of efforts to deal with Zika. Daniel Kass, New York City's deputy commissioner for environmental health, estimated the city, which has high volumes of travelers and prior outbreaks of Yellow fever and a recent case of dengue, will spend $5 million to $6 million on Zika preparedness. Aedes aegypti is not common in New York City, but it is home to Aedes albopictus, another mosquito thought capable of carrying Zika.Umair Shah, executive director of the health department in Harris County, Texas, where Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are common, said he plans to spend about half that much. The county includes the city of Houston.The Obama administration has asked Congress for about $1.9 billion in emergency funds to combat Zika but has encountered opposition from Republicans who contend health agencies should have enough money from prior funding for Ebola virus preparations.Amy Pope, the White House deputy homeland security advisor, said the federal government has already diverted some of the funds from global Ebola efforts for Zika efforts in Puerto Rico. Pope said inaction by Congress is forcing health officials to make difficult choices.Dr. Edward McCabe, the March of Dimes Foundation's medical director, said most birth defects cannot be prevented because their cause is not known. With Zika, the government could save ""dozens or even hundreds"" of newborns from devastating birth defects, McCabe said.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Will Dunham)","huffingtonpost","left","16895","zika",786
"The CDC recommends that pregnant couples who may have been exposed to the Zika virus abstain from sex until their babies are born.From the Washington Post:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued detailed recommendations Friday for preventing the sexual transmission of the mosquito-borne Zika virus, including the suggestion that men who have traveled to Zika-affected areas consider abstaining from sex with their pregnant partner for the duration of the pregnancy.The guidelines were in response to the report Tuesday by Dallas health officials that a local resident was infected with Zika by having sex with someone who'd contracted the disease while traveling in Venezuela - one of the many countries in South America, Central America and the Caribbean where the virus is spreading explosively.Mosquitoes remain the primary way Zika is spread, and preventing bites is the best way to avoid infection. But the CDC said it was issuing the interim recommendations to stop sexual transmission, however rare, because of concerns over Zika's potential link to birth defects. Abstaining from sex during a pregnancy is one option. The other is for men who live in or have traveled to Zika-affected regions to consistently and correctly use condoms during sex with a pregnant partner.The recommendations are for vaginal, anal or oral sex. They do not address kissing.Read the rest of the story here.","breitbart","right","16836","zika",229
"Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) is using the words of Pope Francis earlier this year about the outbreak of Zika in Latin America in order to urge Republicans to vote to include funding for abortion giant Planned Parenthood in a measure that supposedly would help combat the mosquito-borne virus.""Planned Parenthood is a primary health provider,"" Kaine said, reports Roll Call. ""This is really at the core of dealing with the population that has been most at risk of Zika.""Kaine, considered to be a contender for vice president on the Democrat Party ticket, referred to Pope Francis's statement that ""avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil"" when it comes to fighting Zika.Following the Pope's statement, however, in February the Vatican attempted to fend off media claims that he had spoken in favor of relaxing the Church's ban on artificial contraception.As AFP reported, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi explained Pope Francis had only been referring to birth control in ""emergency cases.""""That does not mean that this recourse is accepted and can be used without discernment,"" Lombardi said.AFP continued on the media's salivating comments over the Pope's statement:Though Planned Parenthood and its allies frequently claim that denying its funding causes delays in treatment and a decrease in health care services to low-income women, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) provide more comprehensive health care for low-income individuals without offering abortions.Rep. Diane Black (R-TN), a member of the House's Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives which has been investigating Planned Parenthood, explained last year, ""For every one Planned Parenthood facility, there are 20 federally qualified health centers. Planned Parenthood is trying to put a message out there that if they went away, all these women wouldn't have care.""A report on Black's website notes that FQHCs ""provide women with the same preventative services offered by Planned Parenthood, plus the many things they do not offer: mammograms, prenatal care, treatment of diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, depression, etc.""""In states where the state legislature has defunded Planned Parenthood, low-income women are still able to access the same preventative services offered by Planned Parenthood in addition to many others through these FQHCs as well as community health centers,"" the report continues. ""These health care providers far outnumber the number of Planned Parenthood locations, which are primarily located only in urban areas.""Kaine claims to be a practicing Catholic even though he has typically voted in favor of abortion measures. He voted with Senate Democrats to block a $1.1 billion funding measure designed to combat the Zika virus because it stripped out funding for Planned Parenthood. Despite numerous statements by infections disease experts and doctors who have explained there is little known about the effects of Zika during pregnancy, Planned Parenthood claims to be able to deal best with the virus with birth control and abortion.""We are the front line of defense when it comes to battling Zika,"" Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said, criticizing Republicans.Laguens said it was ""shameful"" for Republicans ""to undermine the ability of family planning providers like Planned Parenthood to do what we do best in the midst of this rapidly spreading Zika virus, a public health crisis that directly targets women and children.""Kaine said he predicts Republicans will fold and allow the funding for Planned Parenthood.""They know what the vote's going to be,"" Kaine said. ""They're aware that it is a move on the chess board but not the last move on the chess board.I think we're going to get there. I think the Planned Parenthood thing was a little bit of saber-rattling and skirmishing, and I don't think we ought to be doing that when we're facing a public health emergency of this kind.""","breitbart","right","16988","zika",636
"WASHINGTON - Republican leaders in Congress may be taking a slow, deliberate approach to dealing with the looming threat of the Zika virus, but Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) warned his colleagues Thursday that it's about time for them to freak out about the mosquito-borne disease.The administration of President Barack Obama asked for $1.9 billion in emergency funding to combat the virus in February, but Republicans in Congress have balked, saying they have questions that have not been answered about how the White House will use the money.In the meantime, health officials have warned that Zika, which is linked to birth defects, is even more dangerous than previously thought, and that dozens of states are at risk from the mosquitoes that transmit the virus.Rubio took to the Senate floor Thursday and tried to convey the threat to his fellow Republicans, saying he is especially concerned after getting briefed by officials in his state.""They are freaked out about the Zika thing. I don't know any other term to use. If they are freaked out, then I'm very concerned about it as well,"" Rubio said. ""And that's why I do support fully and immediately funding the situation."" Rubio spoke after a string of Democrats who had insisted that Congress act before it goes on a 10-day break Friday.The Floridian wasn't willing to go that far, but he suggested that during the recess lawmakers should be drawing up the legislation needed to act as soon as they return.""I hope that there is real urgency about dealing with this,"" Rubio said. ""I understand this is not a political issue. There is no such thing as a Republican position on Zika or Democrat position on Zika because these mosquitoes bite everyone. And they're not going to ask you what your party registration is or who you plan to vote for in November.""He also warned that cases of infection are inevitable in the continental United States, and that Congress should act sooner rather than later, for both practical and political reasons.""This is a real threat, and it is not just the tropical states,"" Rubio said. ""We are going to face the Zika problem in this country this summer and fall.""""My advice to my colleagues is we're going to deal with this, and I hope we deal with it at the front end, because not only is it better for our people, it's better for you,"" he added. ""You're going to have to explain to people why it is that we sat around for weeks and did nothing on something of this magnitude.""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not seem overly inclined to jump at Rubio's request.Earlier, he pointed out that the White House has funding already because it transferred almost $600 million from the effort to prevent Ebola outbreaks. ""Preventing the spread of Zika is something that both parties agree is a priority,"" McConnell said, adding that both sides have been working diligently on the funding.""That's especially notable when you consider how difficult it is for the [Appropriations] Committee to move forward when the administration keeps it waiting for month after month after month for information it needs, as has been the case here with Zika. Progress is being made, anyway.""Still, Rubio argued that this was no time to wait on the normal appropriations process.""It's just a matter of days, weeks, or hours before you will open up a newspaper, turn on the news and it will say someone in the continental United States was bit by a mosquito and they contracted Zika,"" Rubio said. ""And when that happens, then everyone is going to be freaked out, not just me.""""I want to know what people are going to say when this happens and [people] ask what did you do about it?"" Rubio added.","huffingtonpost","left","16919","zika",671
"Dr. Peter Hotez, noted tropical disease expert, shows how poverty in the U.S. makes us vulnerable to tropical disease outbreaks. Dr. Hotez warns that used tires dumped in an impoverished Houston community will serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes that spread tropical diseases such as dengue fever and Zika virus when they trap rain water in the coming warm seasons.Yesterday the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of the potential for the explosive spread of the Zika virus through the Americas.  Margaret Chan, the director of the WHO, warned that the Americas could be hit by 4 million cases of Zika this year. The outbreak of Zika virus now centered in Brazil has been linked to a sudden increase in severe birth defects including microcephaly, babies born with tiny heads and brains. NPR reported yesterday that other neurological problems such as babies born blind may also be linked to Zika. Researchers do not yet understand Zika and have not yet proven causality, but the circumstantial evidence connecting the Zika outbreak to the sudden, large increase in birth defects is very strong.Report yesterday quoted experts who said that Zika was a low risk to the United States because the U.S. doesn't have the poverty and high population densities that have caused the explosive spread of Zika in Brazil, but Dr. Peter Hotez, a tropical disease researcher who lives in Texas, has warned that poverty and high population density makes Houston highly vulnerable to a Zika outbreak. He warned that the whole Gulf coast is already suffering from increasing levels of tropical diseases spread by mosquitoes, in particular dengue fever. Because Zika virus is related to dengue fever and has the same mosquito vector the expansion of dengue in the Gulf coast region is a good indicator of the potential spread of Zika virus.The racism, dire poverty and inadequate government services of Texas and the Gulf states make impoverished African American communities the most vulnerable to the spread of Zika. But what happens in impoverished communities in the Americas won't stay in those communities. The catastrophic income inequality in the big cities of Brazil that led to the explosive spread of Zika there is now threatening the Americas. Cases have been reported in Puerto Rico where it could be gaining a foothold. Zika cases have also been reported in Texas but cool January temperatures in Texas are not favorable for mosquito breeding. Dr Hotez warns that Zika will be a threat to Houston as soon as temperatures warm up this spring.""I'm quite convinced it's going to be all over the Caribbean within the next few weeks. And then, where's next?"" he said. ""Where we're standing here in the Gulf Coast  Pretty much all of the Gulf Coast cities are vulnerable but Houston is the largest.""It is less than 15 minutes' drive from Hotez's office in the world's biggest medical complex to the Fifth Ward, a historic, mostly African American quarter just north-east of downtown Houston.When he hears experts assert that Zika is unlikely to spread significantly in the US, his response is: go to the Fifth Ward and look around.Trash, particularly dumped tires, litter poor communities across the south. Our utter disregard as a nation for the conditions that poor people are living in is a threat to everyone's health. We need to immediately expand Medicaid to all states, we need to clean up trash across the Gulf states immediately and we need to fund research on rapidly developing a vaccination for Zika now.I just vacationed in Puerto Rico. I was shocked to see abandoned buildings in the middle of downtown San Juan, in what was supposed to be the good side of town. The people of Puerto Rico were warm and friendly but disinvestment and predation by hedge funds  has ravaged their economy. There is a shortage of rest rooms for well-to-do tourists. I saw, when I went to certain beaches that the homeless are using overgrown swampy areas as bathrooms. The potential for disease spread under these conditions is obvious.What happens in the fifth ward of Houston, the backwaters of Puerto Rico and the favelas of Brazil will not stay in those impoverished communities in the age of jet transport. Environmental justice and effective governance is necessary to protect the health of all Americans. Hedge fund predation isn't just a threat to Puerto Rico. Growing income inequality threatens everyone's health because diseases that hit poor communities spread to wealthier ones. The lack of adequate health care and basic sanitation in Houston and the Republican controlled Gulf coast threatens all of us.""I could show you dozens of neighborhoods like this in south-east Texas, along the Gulf Coast,"" said Hotez. ""What we have is dilapidated housing, inadequate or absent window screens, standing water, poor drainage, which are going to allow the mosquitoes to breed, and then the classic piece to this is the discarded tyres along the side of the road. Aedes mosquitoes love discarded tyres filled with water.""","dailykos","left","16829","zika",839
"Texas health officials confirmed three new cases of the Zika virus Wednesday, one in Dallas County and two in Bexar County, bringing the total number of people in the Lone Star State infected up to 13. More test results are still pending from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) officials confirmed one new case of the Zika virus, bringing the county's total up to three.In a press release, DCHHS stated the 45-year-old patient is not pregnant and is a Dallas resident who recently traveled to Honduras. ""Upon returning to Dallas County, the patient was diagnosed with possible compatible symptoms that have resolved,"" said local health officials. ""For medical confidentiality and personal privacy reasons, DCHHS does not provide additional identifying information.""DCHHS conducted the preliminary test and plans to send the results to the CDC for further analysis. However, local health officials hope to hasten the wait time for Zika results by testing through a local lab. They plan to screen area pregnant women who traveled to one of the Zika-infested Latin American and Caribbean countries because of the suspected link between the virus and the neurological birth defect microcephaly, a condition where the unborn baby's brain does not fully develop. Health department spokeswoman Erikka Neroes recently told Breitbart Texas screenings will also include ""anyone who a doctor refers for Zika virus testing.""Currently, DCHHS await four more travel-related virus test results to return from the CDC.In Bexar County, the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District confirmed two new cases of the Zika virus, raising the total number of confirmed county cases from one to three. San Antonio health officials stated all cases were travel-related. Three other possible travel-related Zika cases remain under investigation by the CDC.Dr. Anil Mangla, assistant director of the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District's communicable diseases division, said that all the three people with confirmed cases are now virus-free, according to the San Antonio Express-News. Mangla does not want Bexar County residents to panic since no native Texas mosquitoes carry the Zika virus and it only exists in travel-related cases to affected regions, Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported.A concern raised by University of Texas Southwestern and Children's Hospital's Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, though, is infected people could infect the local mosquitos that bite them and ""start the transmission cycle"" in Texas.All but one of the state's Zika cases were travel-related, contracted by individuals visiting Zika infested countries. That outstanding case in Dallas County was the first sexually transmitted case of Zika in the United States acquired by contact with an infected partner who recently traveled to Venezuela.The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) says most people exposed to the mosquito-borne illness experience mild symptoms that can last up to a week and include fever, rash, muscle and joint aches plus conjunctivitis.The CDC suggested Zika may be connected to other congenital brain and vision birth defects, which Breitbart News reported. Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare paralysis disease, increased during the 2014 French Polynesia Zika virus outbreak. While Zika can spread through sexual intercourse, it is primarily transmitted to people by Aedes species of mosquitoes, which, in Texas, also carry Dengue fever and Chikungunya.Mosquito season starts in May. State health officials recommend reducing exposure to mosquito bites by using the same techniques as during West Nile virus season such as applying EPA approved repellants containing DEET, wearing long, loose fitting and light-colored clothes when outside and permethrin-treated gear, removing all standing water in and around the home's exterior, and limiting outdoor activities during dusk and dawn hours when mosquitoes are most active.Last week, Texas reported 10 Zika cases. Governor Greg Abbott appointed a 31 member infectious disease preparedness and response task force to address the virus. Dallas County health officials launched a Zika task force. The World Health Organization declared the virus a ""global health emergency."" on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16842","zika",668
"(Image courtesy of The Zika Foundation)Co-authored by William Witenberg a contemporary artist focused on abstract painting If you have either been unaware of the current Zika epidemic, or thought it was not relevant to you, consider the following: New York University bioethicist Art Caplan recently labeled Brazil as irresponsible with public health by ""trying to run an Olympics and battle an epidemic at the same time"". He advises Brazil to cancel the Olympics outright in order to limit public exposure to the Zika virus. The impact of Zika on the global consciousness is likely to be felt more immediately with the Miami Marlin's and Pittsburgh Pirates notification that they are poised to cancel an upcoming two-game series in Puerto Rico. The Zika virus is not only spread by two species of mosquitos (the tropical Aedes aegypti and more cold-tolerant Aedes albopictus), but also transmitted by recently infected males during unprotected sexual contact. Pregnant women infected with Zika have an extraordinary increase in abnormal pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, and inter-uterine growth retardation. Congenital defects occur in as much as 28% of newborns. Babies born to mothers infected with Zika virus during pregnancy have a diverse range of disabilities including microcephaly (proportionally small heads), skeletal malformations, blindness and impaired cognitive development. For post-infection patients, Zika also can cause a disastrous auto-immune disorder known as Guillain-Barre syndrome or ""GBS"". Guillian-Barre Syndrome is known to cause a range of symptoms from mild tingling of fingers or general weakness of the body, to stumbling gait or paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation. Doctors working in Brazil report that the intensive care facilities are filling up with patients that have survived Zika only to be disabled by Guillllian-Barre Syndrome. Recently, experts working in Puerto Rico shared new data that indicated that approximately 1% of patients infected with Zika who developed symptoms go on to have GBS. These patients require expensive intensive care. Dr. Michael Callahan, a Harvard physician, who specializes in catastrophic infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola and Bird Flu, is helping 6 nations and 3 U.S. states prepare hospitals to treat large numbers of paralyzed GBS patients. Dr. Callahan reported in an emergency international meeting last week, that global response is repeating the 2014 mistakes of Ebola: ""We are too slow, too disorganized, and soon, too late"".The consequences of not addressing this mosquito transmitted virus immediately are serious. In the parts of the world (Latin America, the Americas and southern part of the United States) where abortion is a lighting rod issue, is exactly where this virus is becoming an epidemic. Nearly thirty percent of the pregnant women infected with Zika will give birth to babies with congenital defects. Households will have to abandon regular employment to care of disabled children full-time, thus perpetuating the cycle of poverty in these countries. Zika is a subject that is going to intensify many debates concerning women's rights and freedoms, including the issue of safe conception. The diabolical nature of Zika is that only one out of four people infected by Zika experiences symptoms; a woman can pass Zika to her fetus without ever suspecting the risk she is incurring.While the danger of the Zika virus has been recognized in Brazil and throughout Latin America, this threat is just beginning to be understood in the US. Public health officials are concerned that political infighting in Washington will significantly delay the start of accelerated drug and vaccine development, a process that routinely takes 7 to 14 years. To date the Obama Administration has been unable to get Congress to agree to commit the $1.7 billion originally appropriated to fight the ebola virus. The New York Times reports that Senator Bill Nelson of Florida recently referred to Zika as ""an emergency"". As for Republicans, Mr. Nelson said, ""they are not treating it like one"". Senator Nelson represents Florida - one of the states (along with the entire southeastern United States and southern California) where the Aedes mosquito that transmits Zika is already widespread. On April 27, 2016 a new risk map was released by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) showing that the mosquito could spread as far as Philadelphia this summer. As Senator Rubio highlighted in his recent speech before Senate - it is not ""if"" it's ""when"" the Zika gets to the US. He urged government officials, regardless of their political affiliation, to view Zika with urgency appropriate to the scale of this global threat.It is critical not only that the US Congress allocates the necessary resources to control the Aedes mosquito, which would also prevent other Aedes transmitted diseases dengue, chikungunya as well as Zika, but also expedites funding for accelerated drug and vaccine development. Unfortunately, current progress indicates few interventions will be in place before the peak mosquito season of June to September.  The economic and social consequences of an epidemic of Zika are clearly staggering. Summer is almost here. Zika comes with summer.","huffingtonpost","left","16927","zika",839
"House Democrats on Wednesday accused Republican leaders of intentionally dragging out the debate over President Obama's $1.9 billion request to fight the Zika virus, saying the White House has already detailed everything there is to know about its plea for emergency funding.""We have more information about this than we had about going to war in Iraq, where we couldn't find a weapon of mass destruction,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, Connecticut Democrat.The Obama administration says new money is needed to develop a better diagnostic test and a vaccine for Zika, a mosquito-borne illness that has been directly linked to serious birth defects.It also wants to bolster mosquito-control efforts before the disease begins to spread on the U.S. mainland, while assisting Latin American countries that are already dealing with the outbreak.The White House recently shifted $510 million from the largely successful fight against Ebola in West Africa to the Zika threat. Democrats say that was just a stop-gap measure, so new money is still needed.House Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers and other leading Republicans have said they are ready to disburse Zika funds, as needed, but they need more information about how the money would be used.""It's an important issue. We're in discussion with them about how much do they really need,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said Tuesday. ""They have taken our suggestion and transferred some of the Ebola money through a reprogramming into that account. And we're working with them on it to figure out exactly the right amount of money.""Mrs. DeLauro said she has attended detailed briefings with the administration and Republican lawmakers, so their request for more information adds up to a ""misrepresentation.""""They have no number, they are not holding any meetings,"" Mrs. DeLauro said. ""We have nothing that says they are willing to address this.""For weeks, Democrats have heaped political pressure on Republicans to pony up funds for Zika and other crises, including the lead-tainted water emergency in Flint, Michigan, and the prescription opioids and heroin epidemic.Yet Republican leaders are still trying to rally their caucuses around a fiscal 2017 budget, to say nothing of emergency funding on top what's need to keep the federal government moving.""My understanding from the Republican leadership is they don't want to do a supplemental. They don't want to do it because if we have Zika and we have Flint and if we have opioids - which we really need to do - then other people may want to add some other things,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. ""But that's not about leadership, that's just about an excuse.""The U.S. territories have reported 471 locally acquired Zika cases, most of them in Puerto Rico.While it isn't circulating on the U.S. mainland, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 358 cases that were brought back by travelers to the hot zone and a handful of sexually transmitted cases.Health officials said they expect the disease to puncture the mainland further when temperatures rise, making the climate more hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus.Democrats have said it isn't clear how big of a footprint those mosquitoes have in the states, so the virus may spread farther than anticipated. ","washingtontimes","right","16911","zika",549
"Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly, a condition where infants are born with smaller-than-normal heads, and other fetal brain defects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Wednesday. The World Health Organization is advising pregnant women to avoid the Caribbean and other parts of Latin America, where the mosquito-borne virus is prevalent.As with most outbreaks, it's hard to gauge how scary Zika really is. But The Huffington Post has been impressed with the stories published by STAT, an online health and life-sciences publication that launched in the fall, and in particular its stories from reporter Helen Branswell.Branswell's articles on Zika are clear and concise, and she has a knack for making the complex totally accessible. She's been on the infectious diseases beat for 16 years, cutting her teeth on the SARS virus during the outbreak of 2003. That's when she got hooked on ""watching science unfold in real time,"" she says.Branswell recently spoke with HuffPost from the STAT News offices in Boston to share what it's like to cover an outbreak firsthand. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.When did you realize Zika was bigger than just a minor outbreak in Brazil?In November I saw something on the WHO website. Part of their homepage has a list of disease outbreak notices, and I like to keep an eye on that area. I saw microcephaly on there, and I thought, That's not an infectious disease. How can you have an outbreak of microcephaly? People were saying it might be linked to Zika. And that's when I started paying attention. Then we were watching it. Then as the year ended it became apparent it was getting big. I haven't written [about] much else besides Zika since then.With outbreaks like Ebola, SARS and H1N1, there is a tendency for the media to jump on the topic and cover it with what sometimes feels like over-the-top force. STAT is taking a more measured approach. Tell us about that.I am glad you think we are taking a measured approach. There is too little evidence right now to say what's happening for sure. From previous experience, I have seen time and again where initial information turns out not to be correct. That's true in any emerging story. You have to be really prudent about how you approach it. We have tried to do that with Zika.I think what's more true is the media covers outbreaks in a big way. We hit things like a tsunami. We are taking the Zika virus seriously. We want to do smart stories and help people put it in context. We are trying to figure out where the story is going next and what kind of questions people might have, and how we can answer them. In America, we generally don't have to worry about mosquitoes until the summer. Looking ahead, what are you thinking about in terms of covering the season? There are already Zika cases being reported daily. If you were to chart them on a map, most states will be lit up. I think public health authorities are going to be on edge. I'll be watching southern Texas, Florida and Louisiana, and also parts of California. The CDC has been making a point of trying to prepare people for the probability that outbreaks will happen this summer. But I don't think we'll see the same kind of massive outbreaks as we're seeing in Brazil. On a personal note, since you cover some pretty scary outbreaks, do you find yourself wary of germs? Ever tempted to wear a face mask? Bathe in Purell? No, I don't. But I do wash my hands. I kind of hope most adults would! I don't really have a huge sense that, Oh my god, these things are coming for me! Though if I were writing about H7N9, the bird flu, and going through markets in China where live birds are sold, I might wear a mask there. I actually find it all fascinating. Each outbreak helps you figure out who to call and how to understand epidemiology, and what important questions you need to ask. With every outbreak, you get better at covering it. Each one has its own particularities. Zika is the first time I have covered an outbreak that's mosquito-borne. I find it compelling, and the only way it affects me is I get really tired as I am working full-on. I remember someone telling me that health reporters either become hypochondriacal or act like doctors. I'm not hypochondriacal, and I don't think I am a doctor, but I might not be the best judge of that.Want to learn more? Read Branswell's coverage of the Zika virus.This article has been updated to adjust Branswell's reference to H1N1, also known as the swine flu, to H7N9, the avian flu.

"Dallas County officials plan to take on the Zika virus with a task force, created in response to this week's announcement of two confirmed cases of the illness in the Big D. Twenty-six officials from cities within the county attended the group's first meeting on Feb. 3.Heading up the task force are Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) Director Zachary Thompson and Medical Director Christopher Perkins, plus Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price, according to Fox 4 Dallas. The group plans to meet weekly. Among their missions are gathering information, providing updates, and ensuring uniform county-wide responses to mosquito-related situations.Price pointed out: ""The difference between this mosquito, Chikungunya, and the Zika, this one feeds on the blood meal all day long. Unlike West Nile, dusk to dawn.""However, Dallas County entomologist Scott Sawlis assured task force meeting attendees that the county's existing mosquito management programs can effectively fight the Zika virus, according to CBS DFW. DCHHS already manages mosquitoes carrying the West Nile and Chikungunya viruses, and Dengue fever.Earlier in the week, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said the county was well prepared for possible local mosquito-borne Zika virus outbreaks because of these existing plans which survey, trap, spray, and eliminate affected mosquitoes. He told NBC DFW that the county has ""much more capability to monitor and trap mosquitoes"" plus can test the winged insects quicker. Jenkins noted that crews can survey an infected person's home, lay traps for potentially infected local mosquitos and, if any test positive, spray. In the local NBC news segment, neighboring Tarrant County Public Health Director Vinny Taneja highlighted another advantage. He said: ""mosquitoes don't fly very far - 250 to 300 yards is usually the range.""Breitbart Texas reported that one of the cases in Dallas County was the first person to sexually contracted the Zika virus in the United States. The second case accounted for the individual who contracted the virus on recent travel to Venezuela, where the mosquito-borne virus is prevalent and then, once back in Dallas, transmitted the virus through sexual contact to his partner.Even though there are no reports of the virus being spread by local mosquitoes, this kind of transmission is possible now that Zika virus is in Texas, which Breitbart Texas reported. Triggering a Zika virus ""transmission cycle"" is a concern. Breitbart Texas' Bob Price reported that pediatric specialist Dr. Jeffrey Kahn suggested such a cycle could happen should people infected with the virus, either imported or sexually acquired cases, get bitten by local mosquitoes, and, in turn, infect the mosquito population which then bites other individuals, infecting those people. ""And, once that occurs, it's almost impossible to get the virus out of the population,"" said Kahn.Task force chief Thompson identified another concern, that through sexual transmission, 80 percent will not have symptoms. That could lead to further spread of the Zika virus. Symptoms include fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (pink eye) that can last from several days to a week. DCHHS advised individual who travel  to Zika virus affected regions, upon return, to use condoms to protect against sexually transmitting Zika to their spouse or partner at home.The population at risk remains pregnant women because of Zika virus' suspected links to poor pregnancy outcomes and the birth defect microcephaly, where babies are born with small heads because their brains stopped developing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an alert advising pregnant women to postpone travel to Zika affected areas where transmission of the virus is active.On Feb. 3, the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) confirmed the latest total of 10 cases of Zika virus statewide with seven cases in Harris County, one in Bexar County, and the two in Dallas County. on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16835","zika",631
"In February, when Dallas health officials reported the first case of sexually transmitted Zika virus in the U.S., they left a key piece of information out of their report: The unnamed Dallas county patient was a man who had contracted Zika virus after unprotected anal sex with his partner, who'd recently visited Venezuela, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Thursday.While much of the media attention surrounding sexually transmitted Zika virus has centered around heterosexual couples, due to the association with pregnancy risk, gay men and others who engage in unprotected anal sex should note that Zika virus can affect anyone.""The take-home message is you have to consider any kind of intimate contact between an infected person with Zika and a non-infected person as a potential risk situation, regardless of gender,"" Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota told STAT.The CDC's announcement doesn't change the agency's recommendations for preventing the sexual transmission of Zika virus, which can be spread through semen and blood. Although Zika virus can live in saliva, it is not yet known if the virus can be transmitted from person to person that way.Pregnant couples need to be especially careful about avoiding Zika virus because of Zika's link to the birth defect microcephaly, which the CDC confirmed on Wednesday (doctors and scientists had long suspected that the diseases were linked). Babies born with microcephaly have smaller than normal heads and can have underdeveloped brains and cognitive problems.If a man who has traveled or lived in an area with active Zika transmissions has a pregnant partner, the couple should abstain from sex during the pregnancy or use condoms until the baby is born. While mosquitos are still the primary vector for spreading Zika virus, the new report hints that we have more to learn about other modes of transmission. In addition to the Dallas case, the report provided information on six probable and confirmed travel-related Zika cases in the United States involving heterosexual couples.""This suggests that sexual transmission of Zika virus might be more common than previously reported,"" the report authors wrote. Because Zika virus's symptoms are often mild, many people who are infected don't even realize that they've had the disease. Still, men who have sex with men should care about protecting themselves from the disease. In addition to birth defects, Zika virus has been linked to two neurological conditions, encephalomyelitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, in people recnetly infected with Zika.The CDC currently recommends that men use condoms for vaginal, anal and oral sex for at least eight weeks after traveling to a Zika outbreak area.","huffingtonpost","left","16905","zika",482
"A new test for the ZIka virus has received emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just as officials announced the discovery of an additional mosquito found to be carrying the virus deep into the United States.Quest Diagnostics, headquarter in Madison, New Jersey, announced their company has received emergency certification from the FDA for a new ""Real Time RT-PCR Test"" to provide early detection of the Zika virus. The optimum time for this test is during the first week following the onset of symptoms, according to a statement from Quest Diagnostics obtained by Breitbart Texas.The test will detect the Zika virus RNA genome early on to help diagnose at risk patients who are exhibiting symptoms early on.  So far, at least 380 people have been confirmed to have the virus as of April 20, the Quest statement revealed.The news of the emergency-approved test comes as Pan American Health Organization officials in Mexico have discovered the presence of the virus in the ""Asian tiger"" mosquito. This mosquito is more prevalent in the United States and reaches much further north than the aegypti aegypti mosquito that was previously known to be the only carrier of the virus, the Washington Post's Nick Miroff reported.The virus was detected in an Asian tiger mosquito that was captured in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi. The Pan American Health Organization tested the mosquito and confirmed the presence of the Zika virus.The Asian tiger mosquito can be found as for north as New England and the lower Great Lakes region, Miroff reported. The discovery raised the threat of the virus into states like Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC).""There are officials who have been saying we don't have aedes aegypti, so we don't need to be worried or have a plan,"" Janet McAllister, an entomologist at the CDC told the Washington Times. ""What CDC is saying is: You need a plan in place because albopictus could transmit Zika in your area, and you need to take it seriously.""At this time, it is not known how effective the Asian tiger mosquito is at transmitting the virus to humans.The addition of the Asian tiger's ability to carry the disease makes prevention more difficult as the breeding habits of this mosquito are different from the aegypti aegypti mosquito.Late last week, a 70-year-old man in Puerto Rico became the first person in the United States or one of its territories to die from the Zika virus, CNN reported on Friday.The CDC reports that mosquitoes become infected by the Zika virus when they feed on a person who is already infected. The infected mosquito can then spread the virus to other humans.Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas explained the significance of this method of the disease transmission, Breitbart Texas reported in February. ""As we head towards springtime, if we have a lot of people infected with Zika, either because they are imported cases or sexually acquired cases, that may trigger the mosquitoes to get infected with the virus and start that transmission cycle,"" Dr. Kahn told NBCDFW in Dallas. ""And, once that occurs, it's almost impossible to get the virus out of the population.""Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and is a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

"To fight a mosquito, maybe you've got to be a mosquito - at least that's the hope behind one of the proposals to try to combat the Zika virus.With the mosquito-borne disease creeping toward the U.S. mainland, British company Oxitec says one way to stop it is with genetically modified male insects, programmed to produce offspring that die before adulthood.Oxitec says no adults means no spread for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the Zika virus. They hope to give their plan a test in Key Haven, Florida, and say success against Zika could also cut the rate of dengue and yellow fevers.""I've yet to find the 'Save the Mosquito' society,"" Oxitec CEO Hadyn Parry said in a recent interview. ""No ones likes mosquitoes, and this one is an invasive species. It shouldn't be there.""Yet a vocal crop of Florida activists say the company is trying to test a new product without full consent from the community. They worry that the release of genetically modified organisms will result in unintended consequences for the human population and environment while deterring tourists, who are vital to the local economy.""I'm angry now. They're doing it against the will of the people,"" said Mila de Mier, a Key West resident who started a petition against the trial.The Food and Drug Administration recently said Oxitec's proposal did not appear to pose a significant risk to humans and the local environment, though last week it gave the public an extra month, through May 13, to comment on its findings before final approval.Oxitec's trial could last up to a year and release millions of mosquitoes into a small, multiblock area of Key Haven.The proposal has been wending its way through the federal regulatory process since 2011, when a local mosquito control director asked the company for help in controlling dengue, a flulike illness that can be lethal in severe cases.The emerging Zika threat has breathed new life into the proposal. Though many who have been infected do not show symptoms, the virus has been linked to a dramatic surge in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads in Latin America and a syndrome that can lead to paralysis.The virus is spreading in Puerto Rico, and local transmission could hit the U.S. mainland within months.""Zika presents a very clear and present threat. And really, there isn't any time to waste,"" Mr. Parry said.Oxitec's male aegypti have a self-limiting gene that causes them to mate with wild females and produce offspring that cannot mature into adults. The technology reduced wild mosquito larvae by about 90 percent during trials in Brazil, the Cayman Islands and Panama, compared with 30 percent to 50 percent eradication from spraying, Mr. Parry said.The males it would release don't bite people, Oxitec says, and wild females typically mate only once in their short life spans, so the technique slashes the overall population.""The fight against mosquito-borne diseases has been going on for over a century,"" said Amesh Adalja, senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's health security division. ""Genetically modified mosquitoes are a potentially path-breaking tool that will improve human life.""Among the 1,000-plus comments submitted to the FDA so far, one mocking supporter said opponents probably don't know why it rains, to say nothing of a mosquito's life cycle.Others said they wouldn't travel to Florida as long as genetically modified insects are flying around. One said it is ""extremely irresponsible to conduct such an experiment where the risks are unknown and cannot be reversed.""More than half of Americans overall, 56 percent, say they moderately or strongly support the release of genetically modified male mosquitoes, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Sixteen percent moderately or strongly oppose the idea, and about a quarter have no stance.""In my view, the public is mostly supportive of the program as long as we do our homework,"" said Phil Goodman, a commissioner on the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District's board, which must approve the Oxitec contract after the FDA speaks. ""However, there is a very vocal minority in my view that has dominated the media on this.""Another commissioner, Stephen K. Smith, said he was accosted at the post office by people who were upset about the project.""People come up to me, and they're very hostile,"" he said, though others will approach him and say, ""I had dengue. Do what you have to do.""Given regulatory delays, the trial may not start until the fall - if it does at all.Oxitec would produce eggs in Oxford, England, and ship them to Marathon, Florida, to incubate in the lab before they are released in Key Haven.Once they are ready for release, a truck loaded with clear plastic containers of the modified insects will amble down the road and puff out the bugs with a fan.The modified insects contain a fluorescent red protein that can be used to detect in the lab which mosquitoes belong to Oxitec. By measuring the predominance of mosquitoes with the distinctive marker, the company can get a sense of whether it is winning the battle in distinct sectors of the trial area.""You get this constant, real-time readout of how successful you're being,"" Mr. Parry said. ""If you need to release more, you release more.""Mr. Smith said the technique appears to be ""good science"" and could be an effective tool in the Florida Keys' arsenal against mosquitoes.""But if there is any unanswered questions or any responsible margin of doubt, I would probably not cast a vote in support,"" he said.Ms. de Mier, whose Change.org petition against the project has attracted more than 164,000 signatures, said Oxitec should try its technology where Zika is already circulating.Dengue hasn't been around for years, she said, and the community is dotted with well-manicured lawns and homes that employ air conditioning, reducing their vulnerability to disease-carrying aegypti.She said another groundbreaking technique, injecting Wolbachia bacteria into the mosquito population, is a better way to rein in viral transmission, and that she will go to court if the Oxitec project proceeds.""This is my family and this is my community, and we're living in a democracy,"" she said.She also worries that another breed of mosquito, the Asian tiger, will fill any void left by the trial, or that modified aegypti will mutate in a way that allows them to survive.Oxitec, which has called those fears unfounded, reserved meeting rooms at a Key West hotel so that members of the public can pepper them with questions Monday and Tuesday, part of an ongoing series of meetings and town halls to allay public concerns.""We will have some people we will never convince because that's just life, really, and it's a shame,"" Mr. Parry said. ""But I think there's an awful lot of people who are supportive of this."" ","washingtontimes","right","16901","zika",1173
"The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday said it will give the public an extra month to weigh in on a British company's request to release its genetically modified mosquitoes in the Florida Keys, a trial aimed at slashing the number of insects that carry Zika virus.Biotech company Oxitec cannot perform its field test until the FDA digests public input and makes a final ruling on the trial's potential risk to humans and impact on the local environment.The FDA said it will extend the deadline for public comment from April 13 to May 13, a ""direct response"" to members of the public who said they needed more than 30 days to weigh the pros and cons of the pioneering technology.Last month, the agency issued preliminary findings that said the proposal did not appear to pose a significant risk to humans and the local environment.""The FDA will thoroughly review all public comments and information submitted before determining its next steps,"" the agency said.Oxitec's proposed trial is part of broader attempts to eradicate the pesky Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika, which is blanketing Latin America and spreading locally in Puerto Rico.Though many people do not show symptoms, the virus has been linked to serious birth defects and a syndrome that can cause paralysis.Oxitec says its modified male aegypti, which mate with wild females to produce offspring that do not survive into adulthood, were able to reduce wild mosquito larvae by about 90 percent during trials in Brazil, the Cayman Islands and elsewhere.Female mosquitoes usually do not seek new male partners after they've mated once in their short lifespans.For its first U.S. trial, Oxitec would produce eggs of the modified mosquitoes in Oxford, England, and ship them to Marathon, Fla., for rearing in the lab before they are released in Key Haven, Fla.Some local residents objected to the trial, saying they are being used as ""guinea pigs"" for a new technology. They say it is unclear if there will be unintended consequences of releasing millions of genetically modified insects into their community, either to human or the ecosystem, or if other mosquito breeds will come in and replace the aegypti population.Oxitec says its technology is safe and targets an invasive species that shouldn't be in Florida, anyway. It reserved meetings rooms at a hotel in Key West, Fla., to address the public's concerns on Monday and Tuesday.The World Health Organization recently called for additional field trials of genetically modified mosquitoes, as it prods Zika-affected nations to explore both old and new methods of mosquito control. ","washingtontimes","right","16898","zika",434
"The White House has asked Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to combat the spread of Zika, funding programs to study the virus and control the mosquitoes that spread it, both at home and abroad.The Washington Times reports that the proposal includes funding for monitoring the spread of Zika and studying its link to birth defects and the Guillain-Barre syndrome. It also adds funding to the Medicaid program in Puerto Rico (where the virus appears to be spreading) to develop better diagnostic tests and create an effective vaccine.The U.S. Agency for International Development would receive $335 million of the requested funding to support mosquito control programs, training for healthcare workers, and public education programs abroad.Another $41 million would be given to the State Department to assist American citizens in Zika outbreak regions and provide support to such international health agencies as the World Health Organization, the Pan-American Health Organization, and UNICEF.The Washington Times predicts a receptive audience for the White House request in Congress, since Congress has been prodding President Obama to start taking Zika more seriously. Senate Democrats sent Obama a letter on Friday asking him to take ""robust and aggressive actions"" against the virus.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that Congress would review the President's request, adding that ""given limited federal resources, we expect the administration will brief Congress on their funding priorities"" at a briefing scheduled for Tuesday.ABC News reported that two healthcare experts would be available to answer reporters' questions about Zika at the regular White House press briefing: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.President Obama has been struggling to find the right tone for addressing the Zika issue. In an interview on CBS This Morning on Monday to discuss his funding request to Congress, Obama said that ""there shouldn't be panic on this"" because Zika is ""not something where people are going to die from it,"" but he added that it was ""something we have to take seriously.""""The good news is this is not like Ebola. People don't die of Zika. A lot of people get it and don't even know that they have it,"" the President continued. ""What we now know, though, is that there appears to be some significant risk for pregnant women or women who are thinking about getting pregnant.""One of the things that makes Zika so dangerous is that ""people get it and don't even know that they have it."" It is difficult to monitor and control a disease that goes unnoticed by over half the people who carry it. Scientists are still learning about new ways Zika can be transmitted between infected people. It is an insidious threat that should be addressed before it gets into the blood supply or before mosquitoes in North America begin spreading it rapidly.","breitbart","right","16840","zika",494
"With 220,000 troops on the ground and 315,000 public officials on call, the operation to eradicate the Zika virus from Brazil has become the largest military operation in that nation's history. Many fear attempts to eradicate the mosquito-borne illness before the Summer Olympics in August will not be enough, however, as scientists study the deadly complications that accompany the disease.Argentine news outlet Infobae describes the diversity of the skill sets of those deployed to combat the Zika virus outbreak that has affected Brazil more than any other country. Members of the Army, Marines, and Air Force have been deployed to tackle the problem door-to-door, helping eradicate mosquito nests and educating residents in the most affected areas on how to prevent still water from helping the spread of the virus.Zika spreads through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, present in all nations of the Western Hemisphere except Chile and Canada. It is also spread through sexual transmission; Chile recently documented its first locally-transmitted case through sexual contact, leaving Canada the only nation in the hemisphere not to document a locally-acquired Zika case.""This is a war; our enemy is very dangerous,"" Fábio de Abril Luna, an official in Brazil's Ministry of Education, said of his mission. De Abril Luna is partially responsible for an education initiative that is constantly evolving as scientists discover new dangers related to contracting Zika, new ways of contracting the virus, and new neighborhoods affected. Education officials are urging sexually active couples to use protection, pregnant women to keep their potential exposure to mosquitos at a minimum, and everyone to eliminate stagnant water pools that may form in yards and common household items after rain. This week, Brazilian officials announced that the Ministry of Education would begin offering Zika education courses in three different languages, to answer public questions about the threat.When Brazil's Minister of Health Marcelo Castro initially announced the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of troops in January, his message was a pessimistic one. Stating that Brazil was ""badly losing the war against the mosquito,"" he received criticism from the World Health Organization for making his outlook on the situation public. By the time Castro announced the military initiative, however, the U.S. National Institutes of Health had already decreed the Zika outbreak a ""pandemic,"" with the situation expected to get worse at the Southern Hemisphere's summer went on.While the Brazilian government has escalated its efforts to raise Zika awareness, the ongoing corruption scandal engulfing the ruling Workers' Party has largely hindered those efforts. During President Dilma Rousseff's national speech on Zika awareness in February, protesters used pots and pans to drown out televisions airing the speech as a protest against Rousseff herself. A month later, 3.4 million Brazilians took to the streets of forty different cities to demand Rousseff be impeached.Zika infection is rarely accompanied by symptoms; only twenty percent of people affected by the virus exhibit symptoms. Symptomatic patients experience fevers, body aches, and conjunctivitis injection - symptoms often described as a milder version of Dengue fever. What Brazilian and international health officials fear is the newly-discovered link between Zika and a birth defect known as microcephaly, in which an infant is born with a skull too small for his or her head. The small skull crushes the developing brain, causing severe neurological damage. Brazil has documented more than 5,000 cases of microcephaly suspected of having been caused by Zika; tests on the victims' mothers are largely pending.More recently, neighboring Colombia has begun documenting an alarming increase in the number of microcephaly cases documented, believed to be linked to the growing presence of Zika there.As the weather warms in the Northern Hemisphere, making it a more hospitable home for Aedes aegypti, health officials in the United States have begun urging regional outlets to prepare for a potential surge in the number of Zika cases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) hosted a ""Zika Summit"" Friday to address national concerns regarding the spread of Zika, in which experts stressed the need to be ""ahead of the curve"" on the issue. While the southern United States and Puerto Rico remain most at risk for a Zika outbreak, doctors nationwide are being told to be on alert for potential Zika cases and properly inform pregnant patients or patients who could become pregnant about the threat Zika poses to the unborn.","breitbart","right","16895","zika",734
"The Obama administration on Friday said it doesn't expect the Zika virus to blanket whole states if and when mosquitoes begin to spread the virus on the U.S. mainland, though it wants state officials to map out flareups so that locals can protect themselves.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded nearly 700 travel-related cases in the 50 states and D.C., including nearly a dozen through sexual transmission. Yet the agency expects Zika to circulate on its own this summer, when Aedes mosquitos flourish and start biting.In a conference call, CDC officials said transmission on the continental U.S. should be ""geographically limited"" to relatively small areas, compared to what's occurring in Latin America and the Caribbean.The CDC has recorded more than 1,300 locally acquired cases in the U.S. territories, mainly in Puerto Rico, and an outbreak in Brazil has been linked to an uptick in the rate of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly.Local transmission will most likely hit Texas, Florida and other states along the Gulf of Mexico, based on previous outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya, which are ferried by the same types of mosquito as Zika.But Zika is the first mosquito-borne illness to be linked to birth defects, and it's never hit the U.S. mainland before, officials warned.""There's a lot we still don't know about Zika virus,"" said Peggy Honein, a CDC epidemiologist.The agency urged local officials to report positive Zika tests right away and determine if the infection is related to travel or sexual transmission. If those can be ruled out, local surveillance teams should monitor family members and surrounding households to see if the virus spreads.The CDC said it is issuing fact sheets in multiple languages to make sure non-English speakers are aware of Zika and ways to avoid mosquito bites.The government doesn't want to be caught flat-footed by the emerging threat, particularly after the Ebola scare of 2014, when the death of a Liberian man at a Texas hospital exposed gaps in reporting and forced states to scramble to set up quarantine rules.Dr. Robert Quigley, senior vice president at International SOS, a company that advises clients on global medical and security issues, said the government actually seems to be ahead of the private sector in its response to Zika.""I would have to say that typically, on any issue, the government tends to lag behind, just because of the bureaucracy,"" he said.He cited a February report in the Military Times that said pregnant family members of Defense Department  employees or active-duty personnel stationed in affected areas could voluntarily relocate.Private-sector clients, meanwhile, are still trying to hammer out policies that protect pregnant women and other employees, while remaining competitive in their respective markets.""What they all want to know is, 'What is the benchmark, what is everyone else in our sector doing?'"" Dr. Quigley said.While the federal government outlines its policy, Capitol Hill lawmakers still haven't agreed on how much funding is needed to gird for Zika and implement the administration's plans.President Obama in February requested nearly $2 billion in new spending to combat the virus at home and abroad, yet congressional GOP leaders have forged plans that offer much less.The Senate approved $1.1 billion in emergency funding that isn't offset with cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, while the House moved to take $622 million from the lingering Ebola response in West Africa and other health accounts to address the emerging threat.Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican who is not seeking re-election, urged negotiators from both chambers to pony up what Mr. Obama requested.""As you know, I supported fully funding the fight against Zika with emergency funds to the amount of $1.9 billion, which was calculated by experts in federal public health agencies as the appropriate amount of funds to successfully protect the public health of our country against the imposing threat of Zika,"" Mr. Rubio wrote Thursday in a letter to all 33 conferees. ""I urge you to consider these specific requests as you negotiate the final legislation through this conference as quickly as possible."" ","washingtontimes","right","16962","zika",696
"A Brazilian researcher who discovered some of the earliest cases of Zika, which is now predicted to become a global pandemic affecting up to four million people, told Bloomberg earlier this month that he could no longer research the virus because he had run out of funding, and the government had never reached out to him.Gubio Soares, a virologist at the Federal University of Bahia in Brazil, identified cases of Zika virus in Brazil as early as April 2015, along with colleague Silvia Sardi. Zika was a mysterious affliction affecting dozens of patients in Bahia, where their symptoms were diagnosed as similar to Dengue fever, though they tested negative for that disease. At the time, Soares urged calm: ""Zika virus is not as serious as Dengue or Chikungunya,"" he told a local paper in April. ""It does not take the patient to death.""It was not until December that Soares and Sardi began warning that a link may exist between Zika and significant neurological defects in the unborn. Brazilian hospitals nationally began registering an abnormally high rate of microcephaly in newborn children, a condition in which the children are born with skulls too small for their brains, resulting in severe brain damage. Medical professionals have identified more than 4,000 cases nationwide in which microcephaly has been linked to Zika contamination.In December, when that number was still less than half that, Soares and Sardi warned significant percentages of the population were at risk. Speaking to NBC News, they said in an email, ""It is becoming a serious problem, principally in poor areas, where the control of mosquitoes is a hard task.  [T]he number of [microcephaly] cases is increasing day by day.""By early January, however, Soares told reporters he had lost most of his ability to research the virus, even as the number of cases of microcephaly soared. ""I have no funding for Zika,"" he said then. ""I've never been invited by any official to develop a research project."" His work continued, he noted last week, through aid from other research laboratories, but with no help from the government.The only government official for whom Soares has kind words is Marcelo Castro, the nation's health minister, who courted controversy this week by saying Brazil was ""losing the battle in a big way"" against Zika. The World Health Organization rebuked his remarks as ""fatalistic,"" while at least one national columnist called for his resignation.""It was not exaggerated because Brazil is losing badly really,"" Soares told the press of Castro's words. ""In the municipalities, the mayors have abandoned the mosquito control policy. He is right to say this because it draws attention not only of politicians, central government, but also the population."" Soares added that many homeowners do not do enough to keep areas clean of stagnant water, which mosquitos need to reproduce.Researchers believe Zika is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which also carries Dengue and Yellow fever and Chikungunya virus. Soares has called for more research on this, as well, however, suggesting that doctors do not know enough about how the virus transmits to be certain mosquitos are the only carriers. ""The Zika virus arrived in Brazil at the time of the World Cup (in 2014). At least 20 nations have records of the disease. There is no immediate evidence between her and the mosquito,"" he said at a lecture this month.The Brazilian government has since declared ""war"" on Zika, with President Dilma Rousseff calling an emergency meeting of the trade bloc Mercosur to request international aid in eliminating mosquito populations. Health Minister Castro announced Brazil would fund research for a Zika vaccine, which would make it less important to eradicate Aedes aegypti.Here, too, Soares calls for more research. In an interview with AFP Friday, Soares warns that, just as experts are uncertain about how the virus enters the human body from a mosquito, so, too, they are extremely unclear about how a pregnant mother passes the virus to her fetus. ""It is not yet known how the virus reaches the nerve cells  or which cells are affected,"" he noted.If not contained, he warned, ""honestly, there will be a great number of people contaminated by the Zika virus"" by the 2016 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro.","breitbart","right","16829","zika",715
"A spending package to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus is mired in partisan gridlock, with Senate Democrats saying Monday they ""have no choice"" but to sink the $1.1 billion measure because it swipes money from Obamacare and the Ebola fight and bars any of it from flowing to Planned Parenthood.The standoff comes four months after President Obama requested nearly $2 billion to combat Zika, which causes serious birth defects, and as mosquitoes begin to bite on the U.S. mainland, sparking fears of local transmission.Mr. Obama has threatened to veto the Republican-driven funding deal, which cleared the House last week but faces a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, will need at least six Democrats to support the package for it to advance in a key test vote Tuesday. He implored critics Monday to reconsider their opposition, saying Senate Democrats had a place at the negotiating table and got the spending level they backed early on, but are now ""changing their tune.""""The agreement before us is a compromise with input from both parties, and it represents the last chance we'll have to address Zika for weeks,"" he said.The Senate is running out of time to act on Zika and its other priority - a bill to pull Puerto Rico from its debt crisis - before it breaks for the mid-July conventions.After months of public feuding between GOP leaders and the Obama administration, Republican leaders brushed aside a Democratic sit-in over guns early Thursday and ushered the Zika funding measure to House passage, 239-171, as part of a broader spending bill on military construction and veterans programs.The White House immediately balked, however, saying it still wanted nearly $2 billion to fight Zika and backfill more than $500 million it shifted away from Ebola.Instead, the GOP-authored package offsets $750 million of its $1.1 billion in spending by taking $107 million more from the Ebola fight, $100 million in unspent administrative funding from the Health and Human Services Department and $543 million in Obamacare funding that had been earmarked for territories to set up web-based insurance exchanges.Republicans said they did the responsible thing by finding ways to cover the spending instead of adding to the deficit.But Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said the bill is ""missing $800 million"" and has too many ""poison-pill"" add-ons, such as barring Planned Parenthood from getting the type of funding that community health centers would receive and temporarily rolling back pesticide rules to kill mosquitoes.""It's like we're being dared to oppose this legislation,"" he said. ""We have no choice.""The White House reiterated its opposition Monday, saying the only way out of the impasse is for House Republicans to ""stop playing games""""That they have unfortunately turned a public health emergency into political football,"" White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said.Some Florida Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio, bucked their party and supported Mr. Obama's full request from the start, though the former GOP presidential contender on Monday said the existing offer was ""better than not doing anything.""Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican whose state is at higher risk than most of Zika transmission, said he hopes ""cooler heads will prevail and our colleagues will vote to support it.""The Centers for Disease Control has recorded more than 750 travel-related cases of Zika in the 50 states and D.C., a handful of them through sexual transmission, though experts say the virus could puncture the mainland further once summer ramps up and Aedes mosquitoes flourish.U.S. territories have reported more than 1,850 cases of Zika by mosquito bite, mostly in Puerto Rico.The territory is already reeling from $72 billion in bond debt it cannot pay, forcing it to slash health services while it waits for Congress to finish work on a rescue bill that imposes a fiscal oversight board and provides the island a road map for restructuring its debts.Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew told the Senate to take up and pass the Puerto Rico rescue bill before the island territory faces default on a $2 billion bond payment Friday.""The Senate should take up the matter immediately. Delay will only jeopardize the ability of Congress to conclude its work before July 1, a critical deadline Puerto Rico's leadership has publicly highlighted for months,"" Mr. Lew wrote to Mr. McConnell.The House passed the rescue bill in early June, and Mr. McConnell has moved to take it up this week. Some Democrats have said they want to amend the bill and send it back to the House, which is in recess until July 5, though the majority leader took steps late Monday to avert that scenario. ","washingtontimes","right","16979","zika",781
"The GOP has evolved (ironically, a process they would deny) to be the proud political party of anti-intellectualism, harking back to the Dark Ages with a never-ending campaign against evolution, tired rants denying the reality of climate change, and a medieval understanding of human reproduction.  But sadly this anti-science bent is not restricted to right wing ideologues, but instead has also infected the far left.  While manifesting itself with symptoms in different areas of science, the underlying disease is the same on both extreme left and right: ignorance of the scientific method and the reliance on faith over fact.In the case of liberals gone bad, vaccines offer the most prominent divergence from reality.  The anti-vaccine movement gives us the clearest picture of how the far left and extreme right have become one stubborn bloc of boneheads impervious to the inconvenience of objective truth.  In a rather odd twist of fate, the anti-science rants from the right about climate change and the far left campaign against vaccines meet at a common point of ignorance about tropical disease.  Consider two people circumnavigating the globe at the equator from the same starting point but moving in opposite directions; the two points furthest apart converge at the end where the journey began; so too here with anti-science zealotry on left and right: so far apart they merge together in a bond of extremism.  Nowhere can this circle of delusion be seen better than with the emergence of the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease that can cause devastating brain damage in newborns.Brazil has seen about 4,000 such cases of microcephaly since October as a consequence of the rapid spread of Zika.  U.S. officials warn us that this ""once obscure virus"" is spreading rapidly across Latin America and the Caribbean.  So much so that the Center for Disease Control has issued a travel warning, urging pregnant women to avoid more than a dozen countries in which Zika can now be found.  If you think you are safe here in North America, reconsider:  the World Health Organization concludes that the Zika virus will spread to the United States.  In North America alone, about 200 million people live in areas conducive to the transmission of the virus.  Why Zika now?  As with the emergence of West Nile in the United States, we are witnessing the inevitable march north of tropical diseases as a direct result of a warming planet.   The number of diseases coming our way, or already here, is as frightening as it is real. That climate change would impact the transmission of infectious and tropical diseases has long been predicted from the very first reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  Those predictions are now our new reality.So the GOP denies the indisputable truth of global warming as Zika moves north; and the far left denies the extraordinary benefits of vaccines, which would obviously include a vaccination against Zika (research is being done).  Tell the mother of a child who could be saved with a vaccine that we should not develop one because vaccinations are harmful.  What we have here is the perfect convergence of ignorance mixed with political extremism, wrapped together in a bundle of delusional wishful thinking.Climate change is real and caused by human activity; consequently tropical maladies are moving north.  Vaccines, ever more important with advancing diseases, have proven beyond any and all doubt to be extraordinarily efficacious. Vaccines are the most important, effective, and safest medical advance in all of human history.  Vaccinations have led to the eradication of smallpox and the near-eradication of polio.  Anytime you might have even a twinge of a thought against vaccinations, think of the millions of people who suffered terrible disability and death prior to the development of vaccines for these horrible diseases.  And the millions of people now free from those scourges because of vaccines.  And no, making a personal decision to eschew vaccines is not benign.  If enough people do not get vaccinated, the entire community may suffer because ""community immunity"" becomes jeopardized.   When a critical number of people in a population are immunized, even those unable to get vaccinated, like infants, the elderly, pregnant women, or immunocompromised patients, gain protection from the spread of contagious disease.  In some cases, if immunization drops below a certain percentage of coverage even those vaccinated are offered less protection.  In 2000 measles was nearly eradicated in the United States; with a drop in immunization due to unjustified concerns about vaccines, the United States is witnessing this year the largest measles outbreak since 1996.The deep, terrible irony of the anti-vaccination movement is that the incredible success of vaccines has caused the uninformed to forget how important, successful and safe vaccination programs are; and how vital vaccines are to preventing horrible diseases from reemerging.  And reemerge they do, as measles has.  Measles is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among the non-vaccinated.  There is no treatment for measles, only prevention.    Ignorance, false claims to expertise and scientific illiteracy are threatening our children's health.These preventable outbreaks should remind us that every year vaccines save 3 million lives among children younger than five years old every year by preventing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and measles; if adults are included, vaccines save up to 6 million lives annually.  If you oppose vaccinations you are willfully condoning the death of an additional 3 million children every year.  The Third Edition of the State of the World's Vaccines and Immunization reports that, ""Between 2000 and 2007, the number of children dying from measles dropped by 74% worldwide, from an estimated 750,000 to an estimated 197,000 children. In addition, immunization prevents sickness as well as lifelong disability, including measles-related deafness, blindness, and mental disability.""The study also states that, ""In 1988, polio was endemic in 125 countries and paralyzing an estimated 350,000 children every year (close to 1000 cases a day). By the end of 2007, polio had been eradicated in three of WHO's six regions - the Region of the Americas, the European Region, and the Western Pacific Region.  Following implementation of the rubella elimination strategy in the Americas, the number of reported cases of rubella declined by 98% between 1998 and 2006.  By 2000, 135 countries had eliminated neonatal tetanus and by 2004, annual deaths from neonatal tetanus had fallen to an estimated 128 000, down from 790,000 deaths in 1988.""If you oppose vaccinations, try to justify that position with the reality that in the absence of vaccinations polio would paralyze 10,000 children every year; German measles would cause birth defects and mental retardation in as many as 20,000 kids, and diphtheria would be a common cause of death in school children.  Anytime you have an urge to oppose vaccination, think of your kid dying of diphtheria.  If you oppose vaccinations, you willingly accept that 10,000 kids each year become paralyzed with no reason.Fact vs. Fiction: How the Left Was LostAny Google search will show that the left has linked vaccines to autism.  This bizarre claim comes from just one paper published in 1998 in the medical journal Lancet, subsequently withdrawn for suspicions of scientific fraud, and fully discredited by later study.  Repeat after me:  there is no evidence, none, zero, absolutely nothing, to link vaccinations with autism.  It is a myth, a fallacy, factually incorrect.  Yet tens of thousands of parents risk their children's health by withholding critical vaccinations.  Many parents still to this day insist that vaccines cause autism, even in the complete absence of any evidence to support the claim with the withdrawal of the original paper.  You might as well claim that vaccines cause baldness.  I am bald, and I have had many vaccines, ergo... No, no, I've got the perfect claim:  vaccines are ineffective and dangerous but prevent global warming.   In that we combine belief in something for which there is no evidence and disbelief in another other for which there is indisputable proof.  Perfect.Vaccines save lives, millions of lives, and prevent untold suffering and misery.  Would anti-vacciners deny a pregnant woman a Zika vaccine?  Vaccines are safe and effective, as proven by billions of doses given with no harm. The efficacy of vaccines is beyond dispute with the eradication of some of humankind's greatest scourges and the precipitous drop in diseases once common.  Of course absolutely nothing is 100% safe and effective; sitting on your couch with a helmet does not guarantee an airplane tail won't fall through your roof and kill you.  But the awesome, amazing benefits of vaccines vastly, incredibly, outrageously outweigh any potential risk.  Opposing vaccines is foolhardy, dangerous, irresponsible, and just plain ignorant.  Much like right wing opposition to climate change.   Right and let extremism converge.   Please, please, please stop this misguided and misinformed anti-vaccine campaign and the absurd denial of climate change.  Just say Zika and West Nile if you get weak.  If you want to oppose vaccines, go to an island, with plenty of high ground, with all others of your ilk and witness the devastation as preventable diseases ravage your population while waves erode your beaches with rising tides.  But leave the rest of us rational people to the task of saving lives with the greatest medical advance ever seen in human history while we try to stop further warming of the planet.","huffingtonpost","left","16827","zika",1553
"While the process of fully legalizing a vaccine to combat the pervasive Zika virus may take a decade, experts say emergency-use vaccines against the scourge currently ravaging Latin America may arrive by the end of the year.Reuters reports that at least two groups of researchers are working on competing vaccines to combat Zika in the United States, with American officials hoping to see trials on human beings occurring within the year. ""This vaccine is easy to produce. It could be cranked to very high levels in a really short time,"" Canadian scientist Gary Kobinger, working on one of the vaccines, told Reuters. Kobinger is hoping to start human testing in August. While it would not be ready for common distribution for years, he hopes governments will allow the use of it in emergency situations.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has echoed reports that an emergency vaccine may arrive by the end of the year. He notes that the virus's origins - from the mosquito Aedes aegypti - will help scientists. ""It is to our advantage that we already have existing vaccine platforms to use as a sort of jumping-off point,"" Fauci said in an interview.Aedes aegypti carries Zika as well as dengue fever, yellow fever, and Chikungunya virus. Mexico approved its first vaccine against Dengue in December. Fauci notes that the vaccines currently in experimentation phases for Zika are based in part on vaccines for dengue and West Nile virus, another disease spread through mosquitos. The West Nile vaccine fell through in production because researchers were unable to find a drug company willing to distribute it. Fauci does not believe this will be the case with Zika, as ""we're already talking to a few companies who are able to partner with us in advanced development.""Ultimately, experts believe the biggest hurdle between a functional vaccine against Zika and mass public distribution is government regulation. ""What would take the longest time would be the process of passing it through the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and other regulatory agencies to allow it for public use and that may take up to 10 to 12 years,"" Nikos Vasilakis, an expert at the Centre for Biodefence and Emerging Infectious Diseases in Galveston, Texas, told the BBC.Research regarding Zika virus prevention is significantly limited, in large part due to its mild effects on adults. Most medical experts describe its symptoms as milder forms of dengue symptoms, including muscle aches and conjunctivitis. Up to 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms at all. The danger lies in Zika's effects on the unborn. Brazilian medical experts have discovered a link between Zika contamination in pregnant women and severe brain deformities in newborns. Brazil has recorded over 4,000 cases of microcephaly - a condition in which the infant's skull is too small for his or her brain - in the past two months, all suspected to be tied to Zika.On Thursday, experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that up to four million cases of Zika may surface before a cure is found. Medical experts warn the virus has ""explosive"" pandemic potential.""Since we do not yet have a vaccine - I am sure that will will, but it will take some time - the best vaccine against the Zika virus is for each and every one of us to fight, in the government as well as society at large, to eliminate all areas in which mosquitos live and reproduce,"" Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said this week. Rouseff announced Brazil would ""declare war"" on Aedes aegypti, dispating more than 3,000 health workers to fumigate 2016 Summer Olympic venues in Rio de Janeiro as well as another 220,000 armed forces to affected areas to increase awareness. The troops will distribute informational literature as well as insect repellant to pregnant women.Scientists are also working on ways to diminish the Aedes aegypti population. One British company, Oxitec, is working to genetically modify the mosquito to prevent it from reproducing in significant numbers. ""The firm breeds special male mosquitoes that are released into the air and help stop the spread of Zika by passing along a gene to their offspring that make them die young,"" CNN explains. This too, will require government agency approval, though test have yielded positive results so far.","breitbart","right","16829","zika",718
"It's Wednesday, May 18 and Day 95 since Justice Antonin Scalia died and Mitch McConnell laid down his Supreme Court blockade: No meetings, no hearings, no votes on his replacement.

What's the Senate doing today instead of considering the Supreme Court nominee? They have to recover from doing two things yesterday: They finally confirmed new Army Secretary Eric Fanning, who had only been waiting for a vote since September. And they voted to half-fund a Zika response. Democrats knew that half a loaf of funding was better than nothing, so voted with most Republicans to fund $1.1 billion for responding to Zika, though that's just over half what the CDC and other health agencies say is necessary.

Yeah, that's all mushed together. With that big of a spending bill moving, you know there's trouble brewing, trouble that will at the very least drag out the process of getting this ""emergency"" spending for Zika in place (and this is just on the Senate side, not even considering the House which absolutely refuses to acknowledge this is a crisis and won't go over $600 million in funding). A funding bill this big is a ""poison pill"" magnet. Who knows how long this will drag out? There's already been one fight involving Sen.

"President Obama announced Monday he will seek $1.8 billion in emergency funding from Congress to fight Zika virus at home and abroad.""The good news is this is not like Ebola,"" Obama said on CBS This Morning. ""People don't die of Zika. A lot of people who get it don't even know that they have it.""What we now know, though, is that there appears to be some significant risk for pregnant women or women who are thinking about getting pregnant,"" he added.The majority of the requested funding would go to the Department of Health and Human Services for Zika virus readiness in the U.S. It would fund mosquito control programs, research into the apparent link between Zika virus and the birth defect microcephaly, and increasing the scope of Zika virus surveillance efforts, according to a White House press release. Three specific areas would receive the largest budget allocations:Vaccine development: $200 million of the requested funds would be dedicated to Zika and chikungunya virus vaccine development. Both diseases are primarily spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.Foreign aid: Obama requested $335 million in aid to countries with ongoing Zika outbreaks, particularly in South and Central America and the Caribbean.Puerto Rico: $250 million would be allocated to Puerto Rico, which declared a state of emergency last week. There are currently 22 people in the U.S. territory with Zika virus, including one pregnant woman. (By comparison, there are currently only 51 people with Zika in the continental United States, including one sexually transmitted Zika case in Texas.)There are ongoing Zika transmissions in 33 countries and territories, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"" last week, only the fourth time in history that the designation has been applied to an infectious disease outbreak.For most people, Zika virus prompts only mild symptoms, including fever, rash, headaches and joint pain. In most cases, infected people don't experience any symptoms at all.In pregnant women, however, the virus is strongly suspected to be linked to microcephaly, a birth defect that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads. In some cases, microcephaly can lead to lifelong developmental problems. Over the last four months in Brazil, the country at the center of the Zika crisis, there have been some 4,074 suspected or confirmed cases of microcephaly reported.The Zika emergency funding request is separate from the federal 2017 budget Obama is expected to release on Tuesday. ""We're hopeful that Congress will recognize the urgency of the request and act quickly on it,"" press secretary Josh Earnest said in a Monday press briefing following Obama's announcement. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the research arm of the National Institutes of Health, highlighted the need to learn more about the natural history of the infection, develop a diagnostic test, and create vaccine. In particular, Fauci noted that doctors are in dire need of a fast, reliable diagnostic test for Zika virus that they can use for pregnant women who may have gotten the virus, but already cleared it on their own. The current test takes about 10 days to detect the antibodies an infected person's body produced in response to the virus, but if the patient tests positive, it could mean she had either Zika virus or dengue fever in the past. At that point, an even more specialized test is used to distinguish between the two very similar viruses. Doctors need a specific test for Zika virus, Fauci said, that accomplishes the diagnosis in a short amount of time.Fauci also laid out a timeline for testing a potential Zika vaccine. Phase I testing evaluates if a vaccine is safe and if it induces an effective response in healthy people; because scientists in the past have already successfully created vaccines for two related viruses -- yellow and dengue fever -- the Phase I testing for a Zika virus vaccine could start as early as the end of summer and take about three months. In Phase II trials, if the epidemic is still raging, scientists should be able to determine whether a vaccine is safe and effective within six to eight months, he said.""People say a vaccine won't be ready for three to five years,"" said Fauci. ""That's true, if you're talking about dotting all the I's and crossing all the T's and getting an FDA-, absolutely-approved safe and effective vaccine. But when you're in an emergency situation, I think we can move much more quickly and perhaps get an accelerated approval.""Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stressed Monday that while the CDC is taking Zika seriously, the virus shouldn't change everyday life for the average American. ""If you are pregnant, we have taken the unusual step of recommending that you avoid travel to areas where Zika is,"" she said, noting that pregnant women who must travel to or live in Zika outbreak areas should vigilantly apply mosquito repellent and take steps to avoid mosquito bites.""We've issued a number of guidances, not just for travel, but guidance for health care workers,"" Schuchat said. ""So they know how to take care of women who may have been exposed to the virus and how to council them about things like sex during pregnancy.""Despite Obama's emergency Zika funding request, he cautioned Americans not to panic about the virus.""This is not something where people are going to die,"" he repeated. ""It is something that we have to take seriously.""","huffingtonpost","left","16839","zika",1077
"In this weblog, I discuss with Sarah Illingworth how Zika highlights the interrelationship between climate change, inequality and health -- and the terrifying prospect of a Trump/Drumpf presidency.Evelyn: Aside from the US elections, the current issue I have been following most closely is the Zika epidemic. I find Zika interesting because the factors contributing to the current explosion of case numbers in South America are multidimensional - environmental, political, economic, medical and population health factors are all intersecting to cause this current crisis. My main reading of the issue has been mostly directed towards Zika and maternal health. Microcephaly, a possible outcome of Zika has positioned this virus within the bodies of sexually active women, and there a whole range of articles which have looked at the embodied politics surrounding the Zika crisis. The other dimension which is just now starting to surface are the socio-economic conditions which are obstructing the control of the Aedes mosquito. Although mosquitos have no preference between the rich and poor, poor neighbourhoods face challenges in protecting themselves against mosquitos, and the eradication of mosquito breeding grounds also relies on highly efficient and vigilant public health frameworks having access to all sections of society.Sarah: Epidemics like Zika, and Ebola before it, definitely highlight how poverty can mean some people are disproportionately impacted by disease, or illness of any kind. I was thinking about this preparing for the talk we hosted recently around the theme of mental and physical illness, and addiction. Discussing psychological hardship and how we deal with it can in and of itself feel like a luxury sometimes; it's a relatively small number that can afford to seek professional treatment and support. Even free services can be hard to access if you can't afford transport, or babysitters and the like. But back to Zika - a warming climate means vector-borne diseases are likely to present more often, and a logical progression from that is that poorer, and other typically more vulnerable groups - women, children, the elderly, those who don't identify as hetero - are likely to be hit the hardest. What are your thoughts on the relationship between marginalisation, income levels and the health impacts of climate change?Evelyn: That's a huge question Sarah! The relationships between gender, income levels, health and climate could be cut and sliced in so many different ways. I've written before about how I see climate change as a lens to look at a broad spectrum of inequalities, and gender can serve this function as well. I have actually been thinking about these interdependencies recently because I have friends affected by Cyclone Winston in Fiji. So maybe we can put Zika aside for a minute and focus instead on women and climate change in the Pacific. When thinking about how women's labour in developing countries is changing as result of climate change I always come back to the same scenario. If a woman's job is to tend a subsistence garden to feed the extended family and provide supplementary income, and climate change events occur that result in droughts or cyclones, this labour is negatively disrupted and food security is threatened. The short and long term health and income effects of food insecurity are uneven and poor women and children are the most vulnerable. This is a really basic example, and of course the relationship is much more complex, but I think the example demonstrates the interdependencies of gender, income levels, health and climate change. I feel like it's my turn to ask a tricky question. What are you thoughts on Donald Trump?Sarah: I've only just started to have them seriously! I kept hoping the idea of a Trump presidency was too bizarre to consider a real option, but I guess that's naive. Someone tweeted recently that it's like America is a drama series in its final season and the writers have pulled out all the stops. Just when you thought things couldn't get weirder... That's making light of it, but as we discussed on Skype, the scary thing is that - even if Donald Trump, or Drumpf as I'll now be calling him, doesn't become President of the United States, we can't ignore the now clear fact that THERE WAS A CHANCE HE COULD. That in itself is terrifying. He's repeatedly proven himself to be racist, sexist and inconsistent in his hyperbole - and as John Oliver illustrated so diligently, Drumpf's (self)characterisation as a successful businessman is dubious. He may just be milking his persona to tap into what is proving to be a not so niche target group of voters, but it's working for him.I moved to NYC just prior to the 2008 elections, which saw Obama sworn in the first time, and the energy on Election Night was insane. I imagine New York's one of the few places in the US to be so strongly pro-Democrat, and it was pretty cool to be a left-leaner in the city that night. Of course, it didn't take long for public sentiment to shift, but to go from Obama - figure of hope - to Donald Trump as a potential presidential candidate is a pretty solid twist. If, in an odd way, kind of consistent. One pop figure to another. America is full of contradictions, and stupidity is so often rewarded simply because it's entertaining. Unfortunately US politics tend to have a big impact on global politics, which is why we get to comment. Are the primaries a ripe topic in Germany right now? I guess Germany's presidency is getting a lot of attention too.Evelyn: At the moment I am have having conversations about the US presidential campaign almost daily, but mostly among my expatriate friends living in Germany. I'm less concerned about Donald Trump the person than I am about what his popularity represents. The fact that large numbers of people are voting for the ideals of extreme wealth, dominating power and protection of a 'white America' at any cost is what worries me. My concern is broader than Donald Trump and the USA, because citizens across the world have elected politicians with similar extreme right political ideologies. There are few worrying similarities between Donald Trump and New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key for example.I don't think Donald Trump will be President - he will fade, but the frustrations and extreme opinions of the population he represents will not. I believe understanding what societal forces are producing these political positions is worthy of more analysis and reporting. Which brings me back to your question about Germany and the German Chancellor. People in Germany are frustrated with Angela Merkel, because society is changing. Society in Germany, and indeed Europe isn't changing because of decisions made solely by this leader, but by many leaders in the EU, and wider global international relations. But the frustrations of the people here with how society is changing are directed towards the German government, and some people believe that the solution lies in severe far right nationalist political ideologies. I read this great article, which uses demography to highlight how Donald Trump's campaign will actually mobilise more voters from opposing political positions in the US elections, and I think that the same is happening in Europe, because a range of political perspectives are being more strongly vocalised. If becoming more vocal translates into activism and political participation then the potential is that all rhetoric from the far right can be flipped on its head and actually work against it. Which is why it's important to have an opinion, and voice it.Read Evelyn and Sarah's previous Weblog: Migration & Living in Berlin Right Now.Evelyn Marsters has a PhD in Development Studies from the University of Auckland and is currently based in Berlin.

"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - Two Brazilian women, two pregnancies, one nightmare. But two very different stories.Regina de Lima and Tainara Lourenco became pregnant at a scary moment - the dawn of an extraordinary Zika outbreak, as authorities came to suspect that the virus was causing an alarming spike in a rare birth defect called microcephaly. Both have reason to fear for the health of their unborn offspring.But that is where the similarities end.Lima is well-off, and took advantage of the options of affluence.Lourenco lives in a slum. She has no options, except to hope for the best.When Lima learned she was pregnant, her initial, vertiginous rush of happiness was almost immediately smothered by dread.Lima and her husband had been trying to start a family but decided to put the project on hold in late November, after the Brazilian government announced a possible link between mosquito-borne Zika and microcephaly, in which infants are born with unusually small heads and can sometimes suffer mental retardation or a host of serious health and developmental problems.The connection between Zika and microcephaly is not yet understood, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is strong evidence of a link. And with more than 3,700 confirmed or suspected cases of microcephaly registered here since October - compared with fewer than 150 cases in all of 2014 - the Brazilian government took the drastic step of urging would-be parents to put off pregnancies.But for Lima, an audiovisual producer from Rio de Janeiro, it was too late. She was already pregnant, and her first trimester - thought to be when the fetus is most susceptible to Zika - would coincide with Rio's summer mosquito season.""The first weeks were terrifying,"" said Lima. ""I cried and cried.""She was haunted by fears she may have already had Zika without knowing it - the illness can cause a fever and red splotches on the skin, but is asymptomatic in most cases - and that her baby would develop microcephaly, which ultrasounds only pick up starting in the seventh month.So Lima did what growing numbers of wealthy Brazilian women are doing: She requested an extended vacation from work, packed her bags and left for Europe. She plans to stay at least through the end of the dicey first trimester.""I am in a sort of exile - I could be at home with my husband, seeing my own doctors, but instead I'm here in Europe with a suitcase,"" Lima said in a telephone interview from London, quickly adding that she wasn't complaining. ""I am lucky to have options, to be able to make decisions. Most women in my situation don't have that luxury. They're completely at the mercy of fate.""Indeed, although she's living on a shoestring - crashing with friends and moving weekly so as not to overstay her welcome - Lima's peace of mind comes with a price tag that would be unthinkable for the vast majority of women in this most socially stratified of countries.Her airline ticket alone cost several times the monthly minimum wage of just over $200, and with Brazil's currency at historic lows amid an economic recession, even everyday expenses in Europe have become exorbitant by Brazilian standards.Unemployed and five months pregnant, 21-year-old Lourenco lives in a slum at the epicenter of Brazil's tandem Zika and microcephaly outbreaks, the state of Pernambuco in Brazil's impoverished and underdeveloped northeast.Her shack is cobbled together from bits of wood and perches on stilts over a giant puddle of fetid water below. To eke out a living for herself and her 2-year-old daughter, Lourenco ventures into a nearby swamp to hunt for crustaceans she hawks for $2.50 a kilogram.""I think I got Zika or some other disease not long ago,"" she said. ""What can we do? Just hope that it doesn't affect the baby.""Zika is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is well-adapted to humans, thrives in people's homes and can breed in even a bottle cap's-worth of stagnant water - not to mention the pools of rain water that lurk in just about every nook and cranny during the muggy summer rain season. While anyone can be bitten by Aedes, public health experts agree that the poor are more vulnerable because they often lack amenities that help diminish the risk, such as air conditioning and window screens.The only precautionary measure Lourenco could possibly take, long-sleeve clothing, is unworkable in the unrelenting equatorial heat.Like many of the estimated 400,000 women currently pregnant in Brazil, she can't afford mosquito repellent. Microcephaly fears have sparked a run on repellents, emptying out the stock in many pharmacies in hard-hit areas; where it's still available - often fishing supply stores - it now often costs several times the normal price.The government has pledged to start providing repellent to low-income women and promises to deploy some 220,000 members of the Armed Forces to help eliminate Aedes' breeding places as part of President Dilma Rousseff's declared war against the insect. But the measures are too little, too late for women whose worries about microcephaly have transformed their pregnancies into a period of unending anguish.In the Central American nation of El Salvador, where authorities have urged women to put off pregnancy for two years, Guadalupe Urquilla is struggling to take fate into her own hands.She's traded her dresses for long pants and closed shoes, scrubs out the family's concrete water tank every three days, and writes San Salvador city officials, demanding that they fumigate the debris-strewn public housing complex where she lives with her husband and 2-year-old daughter.Urquilla said her husband is believed to have had Zika last fall and her daughter had dengue.""We're really scared,"" said Urquilla, who's in her 13th week of pregnancy. ""Imagine my baby does not get Zika, but imagine how stressed out it will be when it comes out. The whole pregnancy we're stressed out about mosquitoes.  It's a huge paranoia.""Lourenco, though, is more fatalistic.""If you have to get sick you will get sick,"" she said. ""It's everywhere.""","breitbart","right","16831","zika",1024
"President Barack Obama requested $1.8 billion in emergency funds Monday to help combat Zika virus, and it couldn't come at a moment too soon. U.S. experts are reviewing the medical records from a small number of Brazilian patients born with microcephaly, a birth defect believed to be linked to the virus, and the little patients' scans reveal that Zika may have an even more devastating effect on fetal development than originally thought.The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be causing a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   With the high volume of news about the Zika virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps. Here's the latest information you should know: Experts who reviewed the medical records of babies with confirmed microcephaly are struck at the severity of cases in Brazil, reported Reuters. Microcephaly can result in a range of outcomes, from no issues at all to severe intellectual disability and developmental delays. But Brazil's cases, which appear to be linked to the Zika virus, are unusually devastating because the babies don't just have smaller than normal heads. Initial scans indicate the presence of brain calcification, cerebral cortex abnormalities and spinal fluid between the baby's skull and brain -- a sign that the brain actually shrank while in the womb. It all hints at a ""tough road ahead"" for the affected children and their families, Reuters concluded. Obama asked Congress Monday to approve $1.8 billion in emergency funds to help American scientists learn more about the virus and how to vaccinate against it. Doctors in particular are in dire need of fast, accurate Zika virus diagnostic tests that can tell pregnant women if they have had -- and cleared -- the disease in the past, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the research arm of the National Institutes of Health. Australia is abut 3,200 miles away from Tonga, a Pacific island nation that declared a Zika virus outbreak last week. To help their neighbors combat the disease, and to prevent the virus from spreading in their own country, Australia has pledged $354,000 USD in aid for Tonga, reports Reuters. The money will go toward mosquito control and access to Zika virus testing.Australia has also reported a handful of Zika virus cases, but they all appear to be travel-related, meaning they were contracted elsewhere by travelers who were later diagnosed in Australia. Nevertheless, the nation is committing $283,000 USD to fund laboratory capacity in Queensland, a state where the Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito lives. They're also pledging $710,285 USD to help get the word out about Zika virus among Queensland residents.More Americans than ever before are aware of Zika, and 41 percent of those who say they know about the disease are less likely to take a trip to affected regions like Latin America and the Caribbean.While only about 20 percent of people who contract Zika virus experience mild symptoms at most, this hesitation to travel isn't much of a surprise. The more we learn about Zika virus, the more we learn about what we don't know. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed last week that the virus can remain in body fluid like semen and can be passed on through sexual contact. What we don't know, however, is how long the virus can last in semen, which means people who may have been exposed to the virus and who have a pregnant partner should use condoms consistently until scientists find out more.After Brazil, Colombia is the country hit next hardest by the disease; 25,645 residents have it, including 3,177 pregnant women, reports Reuters. The country has not seen any cases of Zika virus-linked microcephaly yet, and government officials are now questioning an initial projection that Colombia would have 500 cases of the birth defect, reports Reuters.  However, three people have died of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a paralyzing condition that may also be triggered by Zika virus, reports the Associated Press. As in Brazil, the epidemic is prompting a heated national debate on abortion access in Colombia, which is severely restricted as it is throughout most of Latin America. In an unusual step, the CDC's travel health warning about Zika virus is directed mostly toward pregnant women. This means other employees of U.S. companies who want to refuse an international assignment for fear of getting the disease likely have few legal options that allow them to skip the assignment without losing their jobs, says Reuters. Experts also say that they may not be able to sue their employer if they do end up contracting the virus. ","huffingtonpost","left","16839","zika",950
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that at least two pregnant women who tested positive for the Zika virus chose to abort their babies.The Washington Post wrote that one woman in her 30s ""contracted the virus during her first trimester while traveling to a Zika-affected area."" Doctors found the baby had ""severe brain abnormalities"" at 20 weeks and the virus in the amniotic fluid. She decided to abort her baby.The CDC said they ""received more than 257 requests for Zika testing of pregnant women in the United States."" More than 97% tested negative, but the center decided to track nine pregnant women, who experienced ""fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis"" and traveled to Zika areas:Doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester or after birth:Experts continue to work to find an exact link between microcephaly and the Zika virus. Planned Parenthood and leftist politicians have argued that easier access to abortion will help contain the damage the Zika virus is causing in Latin America.""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,"" wrote sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy in O Globo.Virologist Gubio Soares, who first identified the presence of the pervasive Zika virus in Brazil, suggested that legalized abortion in French Polynesia may have prevented scientists from uncovering a link between Zika and severe infant deformities sooner.During a lecture, Soares claimed scientists do not know for sure if a link exists between Zika and microcephaly. This is mainly because women in places where Zika breeds often aborted children who showed signs of microcephaly.Fear of microcephaly or other complications due to Zika have pushed women to seek illegal abortions. Doctors indicate women in all social classes are seeking out these abortions ""in despair over the possibility of deformity."" Some even go through with abortions without concrete proof of complications.Paulo Leão, a state researcher and member of Brazil Without Abortion, said these decisions are another form of ""eugenics.""The CDC announced that doctors had confirmed the Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly. ""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC Director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of claiming Zika caused microcephaly. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.","breitbart","right","16860","zika",432
"WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday agreed to $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus, short-changing President Barack Obama's $1.9 billion funding request and angering Democrats by making other cuts to pay for it.The House approved a funding deal that had been agreed to on Wednesday by Republicans from both the House and Senate. But the bill's future was uncertain in the Senate, where the Democratic minority has more power to stop legislation, and Democratic leader Harry Reid has declared his opposition.""It is a responsible plan that assures the administration will continue to have the needed resources to protect the public,"" Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Republicans said the deal included funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.But the White House said the allocation fell short.""This plan from congressional Republicans is four months late and nearly a billion dollars short of what our public health experts have said is necessary to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus, and steals funding from other health priorities,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement before the House voted.Earnest said the Republican plan would limit needed birth control services for women seeking to prevent Zika, which can be spread through unprotected sex -- ""a clear indication they don't take seriously the threat from the Zika virus.""Democrats have been urging Republicans for months to agree to more Zika funding, and the Obama administration has already reprogrammed nearly $600 million that had been set aside to fight Ebola.House Democrats said they could not go along with the deal because of $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere that the Republicans want to use to pay for the Zika spending.Senate Democrats also voiced displeasure, clouding the outlook for it passing.""A narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off women's access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus,"" Reid said.Still, Ryan urged the Senate to move on the bill.According to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, $543 million of the $1.1 billion would come from unspent funds set aside for implementing Obamacare in U.S. territories, while $107 million would come from unused funds to fight another virus, Ebola. Another $100 million would come from unused administrative funds at the Department of Health and Human Services, he said.","huffingtonpost","left","16975","zika",416
"Zika virus, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, bird flu, swine flu -- these viruses have all grabbed international attention in recent years. In the past few decades the world has witnessed an alarming surge in emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Since 1980, new pathogens have emerged in the human population at a rate of about three each year. Why are we seeing such a surge in new pathogens? One could argue that some of the pathogens may not be new at all; they could have circulated among humans for centuries and are just being identified for the first time because of increased surveillance and reporting. While this is true in a small number of cases, a study found that even after controlling for increased surveillance, there has still been a surge in EIDs in recent times. In other words, the rise of new pathogens is very real. So let's look at the major reasons why we are seeing this rise:First: human overpopulation. I think we need to change the phrase ""breed like rabbits"" to ""breed like humans,"" as no other species on this planet even comes close to the human reproduction rate. As our population grows, available land shrinks and more and more people are forced to live in crowded, urbanized environments, a situation ripe for the easy spread and emergence of infectious agents. Second: increased travel. Our travels significantly increase our chances of catching a pathogen in one area and unwittingly transporting the infectious agent to another area, where it was never before seen and where little or no immunity exists. Third: climate change. Vector-borne diseases are those that are spread through insects like mosquitoes, ticks, and spiders. A vector's life cycle greatly depends on climatic factors. And climate change is helping certain vectors, like mosquitoes, to thrive. Warmer temperatures shorten the incubation time of viruses carried by mosquitoes, accelerate the maturation of mosquito larvae, and increase the feeding frequency of adult mosquitoes. All of these factors increase our chances of catching a virus, like Zika, carried by mosquitoes. Fourth: deforestation and natural habitat loss. Cleared land collects rainwater better than rainforests, providing more suitable breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Lyme disease is on the rise because of our encroachment upon and fragmentation of woodland habitats in the U.S. The Nipah virus is a newly discovered pathogen that is causing considerable public health concern because of its ability to infect a broad range of animals and its high lethality among humans. It was first detected in Malaysia. Habitat loss caused a mass exodus of Nipah virus-carrying fruit bats as they searched for food. This led the bats to cultivated fruit farms that were planted next to pig farms. Unfortunately, the pigs were highly susceptible to the Nipah virus. In turn, these pigs passed the virus on to humans. While these four factors do indeed contribute to the rise in EIDs, a fifth is rapidly gaining in importance and may be paramount: the global trade in wildlife and production of animals for food. About two-thirds of the emerging pathogens come from other animals--and that's no accident. As our demand for animals for food, skins, and entertainment increases, so do our risks of infectious diseases. The U.S. is one of the largest importers -- and exporters -- of animals. These animals are caught from the wild or bred in captivity and then sold for use as exotic pets, entertainment (for circuses and zoos), food, fur, skins, and for experiments. Animals such as foxes, cats, bats, rats, snakes, birds, bears, monkeys -- you name it -- are fair game for the wildlife trade.As we delve deeper into the forests and jungles to seize new animals for the trade, we risk exposure to rarely encountered animals who may carry viruses that are entirely new to humans. We likely got HIV and Ebola through the bushmeat trade. And though we do not know exactly how humans first contracted Zika, we do know that Zika was first discovered in a rhesus monkey.To add insult to injury, the animals in the wildlife trade suffer tremendously as they are passed from one dealer to another, shipped overseas, or killed on site in profoundly painful ways. The trade creates and brings together lots of very distressed and, as a result, very sick animals -- ideal conditions for pathogens to pass on from one animal to another and ultimately to humans.This is how humans contracted SARS. It is believed that the SARS virus originated in fruit bats. At some point in the wildlife trade, fruit bats were brought into contact with civet cats (both animals captured for the wildlife trade) in the Guangdong Province of China. The SARS virus likely passed from fruit bats to civets and then on to humans.  By creating distressed and sick animals, we are also harming humankind. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the massive production of animals for meat, eggs, and dairy. If viruses, bacteria and parasites could tell us about their ideal environments, we would hear them describing animal agriculture among their top choices. For every human on this planet, there are about ten land animals raised and killed for food at any one time. As I have discussed before, the intensive confinement of animals for food is directly responsible for the explosion of deadly new strains of bird and swine flus. Besides directly propelling the formation of new viruses, animal agriculture also contributes indirectly. Animal agriculture is a major driver of deforestation and climate change, which exacerbate the problems I described earlier.   Each time a new pathogen causes an outbreak, we follow a familiar pattern: we panic, ask ourselves how can this be, scramble to create new drugs, sigh with relief when the outbreak ends, and then continue the same behaviors that caused the pathogen to emerge in the first place. We need to stop being reactive. Medicines and vaccines only provide a temporary fix, at best. Even worse, vaccines can actually spur the evolution of viruses, creating resistant strains. Unless we take a hard look at the choices we make in life, such as eating animals and reproducing at such a high rate, new pathogens will show themselves at an ever-increasing rate. As Dr. Dan Bausch from Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine once stated (1): For every virus that we know about, there are hundreds that we don't know anything about. There are a lot more pathogens out there.We can try to play catch up each time a new pathogen makes itself known or we can prevent them from emerging in the first pace. The choice is in our hands.

"What is Zika?Per the Centers for Disease Control: ""Zika is a disease caused by the Zika virus spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week.""That does not sound like an appealing thing to contract but also doesn't tell the entire story. Zika is being very strongly linked to Microcephaly. Microcephaly is a birth defect where a baby's head is smaller than expected when compared to babies of the same sex and age. Babies with microcephaly often have smaller brains that might not have developed properly and a host of other issues causing severe lifelong problems. That is the main cause for Zika Freaka Syndrome.The best way to avoid getting ZikaNow we are bad at math but looking at the global map above which shows where Zika has been reported we estimate that easily 80 percent of the world is unaffected. So go to those places. (This is why you don't have to be all that smart to be a travel blogger.)Women who are pregnant or even entertaining the notion should not even consider going near these places. Period.If you have already booked and paid for a trip, try to get a refund. See if your travel insurance will help cover any losses you incur or suck it up and take the financial hit. What would be worse? Losing $3,000 for a Caribbean getaway or having a child with a debilitating and incurable medical condition? (If you cannot answer that without thinking for a long time we recommend you not become a parent.)Blonde has watched all 113 seasons of Gray's Anatomy and this is her best advice based on that considerable expertise.How to lower your chances of getting Zika if you do go where it isYes, it's yucky, can smell bad and make your skin feel greasy. But so can fish and chips and you probably eat them anyway.Mosquito repellent will also help to protect you against Dengue, Chikungunya, Malaria, Zika or other types of mosquito-borne illnesses. The other ones did not go away just because Zika is getting all of the attention. An analogy could be that just because Donald Trump is getting all of the attention and is horrifying that does not mean Ted Cruz is not also horrifying. The same female Aedes mosquito transmits all of the diseases and, disappointingly, has not yet made a run at The Donald (perhaps he thinks Megyn Kelly is one of those girl mosquitoes out to get him).Here's a legitimate scientific study measuring the efficacy of various mosquito repellents.If mosquito repellent is going to work you have to use it correctly. Do not apply it under your clothes, only on exposed flesh but not on cuts or sores. (Can you imagine how much of it would be required to cover the exposed flesh of a Kardashian?)Be sure you reapply according to the frequency cited on the product.  Sprays mask the skin odors most attractive to mosquitoes and make it possible for people to hide in plain sight. (Don't take that term too literally. If your husband is coming over to the table where you are dining with your lover, spraying mosquito repellent will not help and will only make things messier.)If you do not check your luggage and have to worry about how many ounces of liquids you are carrying or want to risk the spray going rogue in your checked suitcase, you can buy small towelettes of some of the products in most grocery or drug stores. We carry them in our purses when we go where we are expecting mosquitoes.Wear the right, meaning white, clothesLoose-fitting long white clothes are turnoffs to mosquitoes (and are not really depicted in the photo). Sometimes baggie white clothes are a turnoff to people also but we are not here for a fashion discussion.Know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'emThe female Aedes mosquitoes who transmit Zika go out primarily in the afternoon. Use that time to go into air conditioning and take a nap, eat, read a book, see a film or visit a museum but do not do something that will make a baby. (That may include drinking alcohol.)Spray your clothes (or buy some that are already coated) with PermethrinPermethrin was first used as an insect repellent on clothing for the U.S. military. In 2003 it was approved for use on clothing and gear for consumers as well as being a way to pre-treat clothing. You can buy clothing that has been pre-treated with permethrin or get some and spray it on your clothes. It does not stain your clothes but fabrics coated in it (whether by you or the manufacturer) need to be washed separately from other clothes. Here is some exciting reading material about permethrin from the EPA.Know if you have characteristics that naturally attract mosquitosOK, we admit that we only inserted this image to add some sex appeal. But it is also important that you not be an obese pregnant woman (or obese pregnant man) drinking beer and emitting carbon dioxide. (Important in many ways but in this case we are only talking about the Zika virus.)We all know people who have never once been passed over by a hungry mosquito and others who seem to go through life unbitten by mosquitoes. The Smithsonian Magazine recently compiled a list of 9 reasons some people get bitten more often than othersGet a pre-trip blood transfusionIn our exhaustive research and wine-drinking we learned that people with Type O blood are significantly more appealing targets for mosquitoes than are those with other types of blood. A transfusion is a hassle and we can not make any promises about it being covered by your health insurance policy, but maybe if you refer them to this scientific study it well help.Remember that Zika virus's biggest threat is to pregnant womenIf you have pregnancy on your mind or in your tummy just do not risk going anywhere with the threat of Zika.But also remember that mosquitoes transmit a lot of other also serious and even deadly diseases so use these precautions anywhere that the little buzzing buggers are an issue.Earlier on Huff/Post50:","huffingtonpost","left","16834","zika",1109
"A doctor in Brazil has discovered numerous microcephaly cases that predate the Zika outbreak.Dr. Sandra Mattos found data on 100,000 newborns since 2012. At least 1,600 babies born in the last years had microcephaly or smaller-than-normal heads.""We were very, very surprised,"" stated Mattos. ""Borderline cases seem to be present all along.""CBC News reports:Microcephaly occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth. The CDC states rubella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, severe malnutrition, alcohol, drugs, and toxic chemicals can cause microcephaly.CDC director Tom Frieden said scientists found the Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly. He stopped short of claiming that Zika caused the birth defect.Mattos told the World Health Organization that ""other potential factors need to be considered"" since 80% of the microcephaly babies live in northeast Brazil. The Colombian government confirmed 3,100 cases of pregnant women with Zika, but none of the babies have microcephaly.Following the Zika outbreak, however, Brazil has documented more than 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked an excess of 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.Doctors reported 404 cases of microcephaly in newborns since November. They tied seventeen ""to the Zika virus."" Fifteen of the 404 passed away, ""with five linked to Zika."" Authorities are investigating 56 other deaths and 3,670 cases.Yale University School of Public Health Professor Albert Ko claimed the cases of microcephaly in Brazil are just the start of concerns about birth defects linked to the Zika virus.""It seems like microcephaly may just be the tip of the iceberg,"" he stressed, adding:Microcephaly has received the most attention, but Ko found other problems with the infants.""We're seeing a spectrum. Many have fairly severe central nervous system lesions,"" he explained. ""There are also a lot of calcium deposits.  Those can cause seizures and cause impairment in terms of function for the brain.""Brazilian authorities and scientists have advised women to delay pregnancy.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.","breitbart","right","16842","zika",364
"A new study from the Imperial College London suggests the only way to stop the ongoing Zika virus epidemic in Latin America and the southern United States is to wait until everyone has been infected.The study, the BBC reports, argues that the outbreak is likely to end in around three years, when enough time has passed for every person who lives within range of the aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the virus, already has the virus in their system. The researchers oppose any attempts to stop the spread of the virus, arguing that slowing down the inevitable will only prolong the epidemic.""Slowing transmission between people means the population will take longer to reach the level of herd immunity needed for transmission to stop,"" Professor Neil Ferguson, who led research for the study, told the BBC. He added that containing the virus may also trigger a second outbreak among those who are not exposed to the virus so that ""the window between epidemics could actually get shorter.""The text of the study, published in the journal Science, argues that Zika is ""not containable,"" offering as a counterintuitive solution that the virus spread as rapidly as possible to produce ""herd immunity"" among the affected populations until a new generation is exposed to Zika.The Zika virus does not cause symptoms in an estimated 80 percent of cases. In the people who do experience symptoms, they are largely mild: muscle aches, rashes, and eye infections. Among adult men, the chances of severe symptoms are so low that an Olympian has committed to competing in the Games after testing positive for the disease. The minor risks typically associated with Zika make the suggestion of mass infection appear a viable option.Scientists have admitted to largely not understanding how the viral mutation of Zika present in Latin America affects human health, however, particularly among pregnant women and the unborn. Earlier this year, studies proved that the Zika virus causes severe neurological defects in unborn infants. In Brazil, the heart of the Zika outbreak, more than 3,000 infants have been born with microcephaly, a condition in which the infant's skull is too small for his or her brain and crushes it, causing severe developmental disorders.""It's a delayed catastrophe. It is every parent's worst nightmare,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, tells NBC's Today, noting that the regions of the United States with the most hospitable climates for mosquitos - including Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico - are expecting a spike in Zika-related birth defects soon. ""I think it is just a matter of time before we see these numbers increase,"" Dr. Juan Franco added.Aedes aegypti is present in all countries of the Western Hemisphere except Chile and Canada.While the Imperial College London researchers are suggesting spreading the virus further as a means of protection, dozens of medical experts have come out against hosting the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where thousands of cases have been recorded. In addition to being a threat to the Western Hemisphere, tourists from all over the world could unknowingly expose entire populations to Zika, with no trace of the virus in their native land.""An unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic,"" a group of more than 150 medical experts said in a letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Olympic Commission (IOC) in May, demanding the IOC postpone or relocate the Games.","breitbart","right","16997","zika",601
"Senate Democrats are seeking a ""blank check"" to combat the Zika virus, a top Republican charged Thursday, as lawmakers prepared to skip town for a week without settling their quarrel over President Obama's request for nearly $2 billion to resist the mosquito-borne disease.Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, said Mr. Obama made a suitable ""down payment"" by taking $510 million from the successful Ebola fight to prepare for Zika, which causes serious birth defects.Now, Democrats are pushing for speedy passage of an emergency spending bill that isn't paid for through cuts elsewhere.""The fact is our friends across the aisle have requested a $1.9 billion blank check,"" Mr. Cornyn said. ""They haven't told us what the plan for the use of the funds is.""Specifically, the senator faulted a contingency fund that allows the Health and Human Services Department to shift funds around for various purposes.""So what they want to do is play a shell game with this money,"" Mr. Cornyn said.Republicans say the request for more Zika money should be vetted through the annual appropriations process, because the administration hasn't been specific about its plans so far.The White House and congressional Democrats say the GOP is stalling in the face of political pressure from their right flank, as conservatives cry foul over federal spending levels.""Everybody knows what's in this legislation,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid told Mr. Cornyn. ""What my friend, the assistant Republican leader, said is nonsense.""Zika is already spreading in Puerto Rico, where nearly 500 people have been infected. Travelers have brought 388 cases back to the states and D.C., and the virus could puncture the mainland further when mosquito season hits this summer.Bipartisan negotiators from the Senate Appropriations Committee are working on a $1.1 billion package to partially fund Mr. Obama's Zika request, but the talks haven't yielded results so far, and it is unclear if the House would approve such a package.Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat, said senators should not depart for a weeklong recess late Thursday unless they find a way forward.""While we're home glad-handing people during the next week, we should be doing something here to address this emergency,"" he said. ","washingtontimes","right","16919","zika",367
"On August 5, hundreds of American athletes will walk into Rio de Janeiro's Maracanã Stadium, waving to the crowd as they parade behind the United States flag, kicking off the 2016 Summer Olympic Games.NBA superstar Steph Curry will not be one of them.Citing an assortment of nagging injuries, Curry made his decision public on Monday, bowing out of what would've been his first Olympic experience via a tweeted statement.""After a great deal of internal thought and several discussions with my family, the Warriors and my representatives, I've elected to withdraw my name from the list of eligible players on Team USA's preliminary roster for the 2016 Summer Games in Brazil,"" it read.My previous experiences with USA Basketball have been incredibly rewarding, educational and enjoyable, which made this an extremely difficult decision for me and my family. However, due to several factors -- including recent ankle and knee injuries -- I believe this is the best decision for me at this stage of my career. It's an incredible honor to represent your country and wear ""USA"" on your chest, but my primary basketball-related objective this summer needs to focus on my body and getting ready for the 2016-17 NBA season.Stephen Curry statement regarding USA Basketball & 2016 Summer Olympics: pic.twitter.com/sBF4eVrIyHNotably, the two-time Golden State Warriors MVP did not mention the Zika virus as a reason for his removal from the Rio roster. Many other athletes and even fellow NBA stars have, however, publicly expressed their concerns over the mosquito-born illness, which has been linked to neurological birth defects and has been wreaking havoc throughout Brazil.Chicago Bulls power forward and longtime heart and soul of Spain's national team Pau Gasol is the latest. Just last weekend he explained the dilemma facing these athletes -- and how it isn't just a matter of their own wellbeing, but that of their loved ones as well.""Some of these athletes are planning to have children in the near future and this could affect them, it could affect the health of their kids and their wives,"" Gasol said.For a guard whose knees and ankles are as valuable as they are fragile, Curry's decision to abstain from the Games is understandable. The Warrior has been plagued by lower-body injuries all his career, and a pair of scares early in the 2016 playoffs served as a necessary, timely reminder at how tenuous his time on the court really is.Add into the mix the gruesome leg injury Paul George suffered in a Team USA scrimmage in 2014, and one can see why Curry would want to be wary.With or without Curry, Team USA will be the heavy favorite heading into August's competition. Now, it'll simply have to get the gold done without the NBA's Golden State star.  ","huffingtonpost","left","16958","zika",485
"The governor of Peru's Tumbes province, Ricardo Flores Dioses, kicked off a campaign to distribute condoms and insect repellents to prevent the spread of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in his jurisdiction located in the northern part of the country.Health authorities in the United States have confirmed that the Zika virus can also be transmitted through sexual contact.The virus has been linked to microcephaly, a neurological disorder that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads, and Guillain-Barré, a rare syndrome that causes the immune system to damage nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis.Correo reports that the plan to distribute repellent and condoms to prevent the spread of the disease was agreed upon following a meeting between the governor and Tumbes's senior health officials.The Regional Health Authority of Tumbes, known by its Spanish acronym DIRESA, began to develop a contingency plan after the United States revealed that the virus can also be spread through sexual contact, adds the report.Figures provided by DIRESA revealed that just over 6,000 women are expected to become pregnant in Tumbes this year.Rommel Veintimilla, DIRESA's head of epidemiology, noted that 35 percent of the entire population of Tumbes are women of childbearing age.According to the latest estimate by Peru's National Institute of Statistics, the population of Tumbes province is 237,685.If 35 percent of the population are childbearing age females, that means an average of about 80,000 women are at risk of their babies being born with microcephaly if they become pregnant and contract Zika.Veintimilla stressed that five thousand women gave birth in Tumbes last year, adding that the number of pregnancies fluctuates around that figure.Health authorities in Tumbes have urged women to use contraceptives in order to avoid the consequences of getting pregnant, while the risk of contracting the Zika virus remains a concern.Peru is not among the 30 countries and territories identified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as ""areas with Zika."" The majority (26) of those countries and territories, however, are in the Americas.Health ministers in several Latin American countries listed by the CDC - including El Salvador, Ecuador, and Colombia - are urging women to postpone pregnancy.Flores Dioses, the governor of Tumbes, was listed as a ""narco-governor"" in a December 2014 report of Insight Crime, which tracks organized crime.The Tumbes governor was one of ""at least six governors under investigation or facing charges for crimes ranging from embezzlement to drug trafficking, which undermines the legitimacy of regional government in many parts of the country,"" noted the report.Jaime Antezana, a drug trafficking analyst, referred to the crime-linked elected officials as ""narco-governors.""""The newly elected governor of Peru's Tumbes province, Ricardo Flores Dioses, faces 70 allegations including embezzlement, money laundering, extortion and concealment,"" reports Insight Crime. ""In 2008, Flores was sentenced to four years in prison for the misappropriation of public funds, but his sentence has been suspended. A large portion of his other judicial processes have been archived.""""Prior to being elector governor, Flores served as mayor of the city of Tumbes for four terms. He has been linked to the fugitive former governor of Tumbes, Gerardo Viñas, who is under investigation for corruption,"" it adds.Health officials in Brazil, home to more confirmed Zika cases than any other affected country, found that the disease can also be contracted trough blood transfusion.","breitbart","right","16836","zika",565
"ANALYSIS/OPINION:The Zika virus is raising alarms. It can cause serious neurological complications for women and babies, and microcephaly in newborns: smaller than normal heads and brains, and severe debilities requiring expensive care throughout a person's life.Although Zika can be transmitted via sexual contact, its primary carrier is Aedes aegypti. Known as the Yellow Fever mosquito, this flying killer has rebounded from near eradication in the 1960s to being a dangerous scourge in Brazil, other South and Central American countries, Puerto Rico, Caribbean islands, Africa and Asia.Found in Hawaii and some southern U.S. states and European nations, as well, they also carry other dangerous diseases. Yellow fever causes fevers, chills, nausea, muscle pains, and liver and kidney damage when these symptoms recur. A vaccine exists, but it still kills up to 30,000 people annually.Equally painful and debilitating, dengue fever can recur for years; there is no vaccine, and it sickens nearly 100 million people a year, killing some 25,000. Chikungunya causes often severe fever, headaches, muscle and joint pain, rashes and other non-lethal problems.All these diseases also infect blood supplies, making transfusions risky and requiring blood from safe locales that often lack sufficient supplies themselves.The prospect that Summer Olympics fans and athletes could get infected and carry these diseases from Brazil back to their home countries has health officials worried. So does the likelihood that thousands of other travelers will also spread these diseases.Rarely flying farther than 80 feet from where they hatch, Ae. aegypti love people and houses, bite during the day, and hatch from eggs laid in tires, cans, jars, flower pots, vases, bromeliads, holes in trees, and almost any other container holding water around homes, indoors and outdoors, in backyards and junkyards.A promising high-tech solution involves releasing male mosquitoes that have been sterilized by radiation, so they cannot mate successfully - or genetically modified so their progeny die before reaching maturity. Since male mosquitoes don't bite, releasing them into urban areas poses few health risks.At least one experimental GMO effort has been field-tested, somewhat successfully, with gradual but noticeable reductions in mosquito populations in test areas. Some politicians, disease control experts and researchers would like the program's funding expanded.However, field tests are just that: tests. The experimental programs must still survive long U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Agriculture Department approval processes, budgetary constraints, anti-biotechnology and anti-radiation activism and international concerns.It is thus highly unlikely that either program can be ramped up sufficiently to help in the near-term across the sprawling Rio de Janeiro Olympics venues, urban areas and shantytowns - much less across millions of square miles in Latin America, Africa, Asia and beyond.Until the sterilized or GMO methods can be approved and implemented on a large scale at reduced costs, other strategies must be employed to eliminate the mosquitoes and the diseases they spread.Fortunately, the World Health Organization, national health ministries, neighborhoods and individual families can undertake simple, low-cost actions that will bring rapid, significant returns with the limited time, money and resources available - by eliminating mosquitoes and keeping them away from people. They need to do so, now.1) Destroy mosquito-producing sites. Empty containers every week; punch holes in cans and tires, so they cannot collect water; fill in other standing water areas with dirt. Where this is not possible, use chemicals.2) Used properly, today's larvicides and insecticides are safe - especially compared to the misery and devastation spread by mosquitoes. Centers for Disease Control, National Institutes of Health and other studies have concluded that the most commonly used larvicides (BTI and Temephos, aka Abate) are safe for humans and mammals, even in drinking water.3) Use personal insect repellants, preferably those containing DEET, even while indoors, and keep skin covered with clothing. To keep mosquitoes out of homes, screens, spatial repellents like DDT can be sprayed on walls and doorways.4) Educate politicians, local leaders, teachers, neighborhood organizations and citizens about the dangers posed by mosquitoes and the diseases they carry - and what they can do to help. Launch and coordinate home and neighborhood programs, and emphasize why they must continue well into the future.5) Employ cellphone GPS systems to locate and monitor mosquito populations, biting incidences and disease outbreaks. Tie these efforts into local or national databases and monitoring and surveillance programs that can dispatch response teams.Preventing mosquito bites breaks the disease transmission cycle and is especially important for people attending the Olympics or vacationing where problems exist, so they don't take diseases home.6) Test people for antibodies, especially pregnant women, to determine whether they have Zika or other mosquito-transmitted diseases. The RT-PCR test can find Zika proteins and genetic material in people and in the brains and placentas of infants and miscarried fetuses, and can rule out Dengue, Yellow and Chikungunya fever viruses.This arsenal of potential weapons represents truly integrated vector and disease control.It's not as sexy as irradiated or GMO bugs. But, history shows it will save lives now - in time for the Olympics, and before these awful, preventable diseases claim more victims. Robert J.

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday an emerging Senate deal to partially fund President Obama's $1.9 billion request to fight the Zika virus is ""completely inadequate.""Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said Congress should pony up the full request instead of accepting the $1.1 billion figure that is being discussed in the upper chamber.""That's not half a loaf, that's half a shoe - you can't get there from here,"" Mrs. Pelosi said.For months, the White House has pushed for the full $1.9 billion to gird against the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne illness that causes birth defects. It says that is what's needed to develop a better diagnostic test and vaccine for the disease, while boosting mosquito control efforts in the states.It also wants to backfill nearly $600 million it shifted from other accounts to prepare for Zika right now, including $510 million from the fight against Ebola in West Africa.An emerging Senate compromise by Sen. Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican, and Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, would allow senators to vote on emergency Zika funding as an amendment to one of the fiscal 2017 spending bills.But Mrs. Pelosi said the $1.1 billion figure just ""doesn't do the job, and the job needs to be done.""Florida's senators agreed, releasing a bipartisan, $1.9 billion plan Thursday to fully fund Mr. Obama's request as a competing amendment to the compromise being drafted by their colleagues.""The administration has been clear from the start: It's going to take $1.9 billion to stop the spread of this virus, not $1.1 [billion],"" said Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat who joined forces with Republican Sen.

"Fear of microcephaly or other complications due to Zika have pushed women to illegal abortions, according to the Brazilian daily Folha de São Paulo.Doctors indicate women in all social classes are seeking out these abortions ""in despair over the possibility of deformity."" Some even go through with abortions without concrete proof of complications.Paulo Leão, a state researcher and member of Brazil Without Abortion, said these decisions are another form of ""eugenics.""Abortions cost between $1,250 - $3,750.Planned Parenthood and leftist politicians have argued that easier access to abortion will help contain the damage the Zika virus is causing in Latin America.""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,"" wrote sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy in O Globo, another national publication.Virologist Gubio Soares, who first identified the presence of the pervasive Zika virus in Brazil, suggested that legalized abortion in French Polynesia may have prevented scientists from uncovering a link between Zika and severe infant deformities sooner.During a lecture, Soares claimed scientists do not know for sure if a link exists between Zika and microcephaly. This is mainly because women in places where Zika breeds often aborted children who showed signs of microcephaly, a disorder now linked to the virus. Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth, causing a small skull. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.Soares suggested that legalized abortion in French Polynesia may have prevented scientists from uncovering the crucial link between Zika and the disorder.Doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester or after birth:Brazil outlawed abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. A judge must approve the case.One Brazilian judge announced he will grant Zika-infected women abortions if they can prove their unborn child has microcephaly. He insisted these abortions are ""valid"" if reports prove the child will ""be born dead"" or ""life after birth is impossible."" He will require at least three separate medical records to reach his decision.Colombian Deputy Health Minister Fernando Ruiz confirmed women with Zika may receive an abortion if they can prove the baby has microcephaly.Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia have advised women not to get pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.Giselle Carino, deputy director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation's (IPPF) Western Hemisphere Region, called the move ""insufficient at best"" and ""needs to be more comprehensive.""","breitbart","right","16832","zika",468
"Conservatives are spoiling for an election-year spending fight, saying if President Obama wants any of the nearly $2 billion he has requested to fight Zika, the budget will have to be cut elsewhere.Democrats, however, are declaring the fight against the mosquito-borne illness to be an emergency similar to wars and hurricanes, in which Congress routinely tacks the costs onto the deficit rather than searching for offsets.Heritage Action, an influential conservative group, said last week that if Republicans agree to Mr. Obama's request for more money, it should come from somewhere else. The group suggested cutting money to combat global warming or to the United Nations.""One of the reasons House Republicans won their majority in 2010 was in response to the Obama administration's reckless overspending,"" said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action. ""If lawmakers believe the administration's funding request is important, the cost should be fully offset within the fiscal year. A Republican-led Congress should be able to demonstrate an ability to prioritize spending.""The fight over offsets could sour a deal shaping up in the Senate, where Republican and Democratic negotiators say they are nearing a package that would at least partially fund Mr. Obama's $1.9 billion request.The offsets debate frequently pits Republican leaders intent on fiscal discipline against party centrists and Democrats who say crises demand swift action, even if it means running up the deficit.Eric Cantor, as House majority leader, said five years ago that if Congress provided funding to help victims of a devastating tornado in Joplin, Missouri, it would have to offset the money with spending cuts elsewhere.Democrats labeled the Virginia Republican ""heartless,"" but Mr. Cantor wanted to avoid the type of conservative backlash that stung Majority Leader Tom DeLay in 2005, when he said it was right to borrow billions of dollars for Hurricane Katrina relief because the federal budget had no more fat to trim.Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee kicked off similar fights over supplemental spending less than two years before Republican leaders were slammed for slow-walking billions of dollars in relief for Superstorm Sandy recovery after a contentious vote to resolve the ""fiscal cliff"" standoff at the dawn of 2013.In 2014, Democrats sounded the alarm over expiring unemployment benefits, while Republican leaders said any reauthorization bill needed be fully offset and include job creation measures.As a political matter, these fights are born from ""a general distaste among some members for federal spending, but also from a belief that Congress uses emergency spending bills as vehicles for spending that not everyone thinks is an emergency,"" said Molly Reynolds, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.She said routine use of emergency supplemental bills to pay for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as targeted spending for Sandy victims, contributed to that perception.""If there was an expectation that Congress would finish the regular appropriations process in a timely manner, there might be less of an incentive to use the emergency appropriations process to ensure the money comes through,"" Ms. Reynolds said.Those appropriations bills are starting to move, but Democrats say there is no time to waste on Zika, which is spreading in Puerto Rico and could cause a crisis on the mainland once temperatures climb, allowing disease-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to proliferate.With summer looming, Democrats say Congress shouldn't get bogged down in a fight over an offset.""We didn't need it for Ebola. We had four cases of Ebola, and we appropriated $4 billion in emergency funding,"" said Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat. ""We've already had hundreds of cases of Zika. I'm not sure why it would be a different standard.""I think moving forward, we need to have reservoir funds to be able to use to get out of these crises,"" he added. ""We have to get out of this habit of waiting until an epidemic is on us to be able to appropriate dollars.""Others say Congress shouldn't be waging these fights in the first place, arguing that disaster relief falls primarily on state and local governments.""More and more, because of politics, those are being kicked up to the federal level,"" said Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute.He said federal agencies should step if they have capabilities beyond what state and local government can do, like when the Coast Guard swooped in to save lives after Hurricane Katrina.Otherwise, he said, there is no advantage to federal intervention: States fall back on Washington's safety net instead of saving for contingencies, and federal involvement makes it hard to tell who's in charge amid the chaos.""There's too many chefs in the kitchen,"" Mr. Edwards said. ","washingtontimes","right","16915","zika",788
"Sen. Marco Rubio is joining Senate Democrats in urging the GOP to approve President Barack Obama's request for $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Zika virus research.The former Republican presidential candidate said on the floor of the Senate that in his home state of Florida, health officials are ""freaked out about this Zika thing.""""If they're freaked out, then I'm very concerned about it as well, and that's why I do support fully and immediately funding this situation, and I've asked our colleagues to do so as quickly as possible,"" Rubio said, reports CNSNews.com.Rubio added that the spread of mosquitoes in Florida is ""massive.""He continued:Rubio's Republican colleagues have opposed Obama's requested funds, arguing that the call to approve them amounts to a ""blank check"" for the Obama administration.""I think responsible members of the Senate - and I would expect all 100 of us would put ourselves in that category - would want to know where the transparency is, where the accountability is, where the plan is, so we can sit down and do this as mature adults in a nonpartisan way in order to solve the problem,"" said John Cornyn of Texas, the second-leading Republican in the Senate, reports News-Press.com.Rubio countered, however, that failing to act quickly could allow the Zika virus to spread during the upcoming warm mosquito season.""My advice to my colleagues is, we're going to deal with this, and I hope we deal with it at the front end, because not only is it better for our people, it's better for you,"" Rubio said. ""You're going to have to explain to people why it is that we sat around for weeks and did nothing on something of this magnitude.""Rubio joined Democrats such as Sen. Patty Murray in a push for the emergency Zika funding.""Too many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle still don't seem to see Zika as an emergency,"" Murray said Thursday, reports The Atlantic, adding that some Republicans think it can wait ""weeks, or even months.""""Republicans in Congress might be able to wait that long-but families across the country simply can't,"" she pressed.The report continues:The urgency about the spread of the Zika virus among the Obama administration and its leftwing supporters has indeed been called into question, especially since abortion advocates have attached fears of the virus and its link, in some cases, to birth defects, to the need for more access to abortion in countries that have refused to legalize the procedure.The CDC has recently stated that the Zika virus ""can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, and infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect of the brain called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.""Planned Parenthood - and its colleagues in the fetal tissue business - has latched on to the message that Zika is an urgent crisis.""Zika has made a long-standing public health crisis impossible to ignore and demonstrates the critical need of government support for sexual and reproductive health care,"" Chloe Cooney, director of global advocacy for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. ""The ability to decide if and when to have children is basic health care, but it's a basic human right as well, and yet it's not realized for so many women across the region, which this outbreak is making so crystal clear.""A special House panel investigating the fetal tissue practices of Planned Parenthood is also scrutinizing StemExpress, the primary biomedical company that has engaged with the abortion business in the transfer of the body parts of aborted babies. As the Washington Post reports, StemExpress names Zika as one of the reasons why it requires fetal tissue procurement:Recently, however, a Fordham University social ethics professor wrote that the radical left could well be using the Zika virus to impose its eugenicist impulses on countries that prohibit abortion.Charles C. Camosy wrote at the Los Angeles Times that the ""eugenic impulse"" is ""so deeply embedded in U.S. culture that we don't even recognize it.""Even if a definitive link between Zika and birth defects is determined, he observed, ""Abortion is a crude response to the possibility of microcephaly.""Dr. Michelle Cretella, president of the American College of Pediatricians, sees the left's Zika scare as part of a plan to promote abortion at a time when Planned Parenthood's fetal tissue practices have been exposed through the recent baby parts video scandal.""Planned Parenthood's use of Zika virus in promoting abortion amounts to an act of desperation,"" she tells Breitbart News. ""As usual, the abortion giant plays on people's fears (of having a disabled child) and omits important facts.""Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told Breitbart News recently that, if Zika is such a true scare, the government should wipe the virus out completely by lifting the ban on DDT.""DDT was the most effective public health weapon of all time,"" she explains, adding:""Substitute pesticides are far more toxic and expensive,"" Orient adds. ""People are advised to use insect repellents such as DEET - which is absorbed through the skin, and safety in pregnancy is not established.""Pioneer Energy president Dr. Robert Zubrin recently echoed the same idea at National Review: ""The most effective pesticide is DDT. If the Zika catastrophe is to be prevented in time, we need to use it.""Orient further writes at the Heartland Institute about the Zika ""scare:""While Orient says Zika - like German measles or rubella - can apparently cause microcephaly, she asserts, ""MOST microcephaly is NOT caused by Zika. About 7 of 10,000 babies born in the U.S. have microcephaly - no thanks to Zika. Most (more than 90 percent) of the Brazilian babies recently confirmed to have microcephaly tested negative for Zika.""Cretella agrees, stating, ""Those of us who value the lives of all patients respond with the obvious: 'Kill mosquitoes not babies.'""""Internal residual spraying of households with DDT is recognized as an effective means of controlling another devastating mosquito-borne illness: malaria,"" she notes, adding:According to the CDC, Americans should ""use an outdoor flying insect spray where mosquitoes rest"" as a mean to control the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus. Inside the home, CDC suggests keeping doors and windows closed and using an indoor flying insect fogger or spray such as those containing Tetramethrin or Imidacloprid.","breitbart","right","16924","zika",1072
"ICYMI Health features what we're reading this week.This week, as news about Brazil's Zika virus dominated our social media feeds, our graphics editor carefully diagrammed the illness for us -- outlining the virus' origin, mapping its spread, and pinpointing Zika-carrying mosquito territory -- all in easy-to-read illustrations. Clearly, we were impressed.In lighter news, we read up on the psychology of why some people take breakups harder than others, and chuckled over a humorous essay about a digital detox gone wrong.Read on and tell us in the comments: What did you read and love this week?At-a-glance graphics illustrate where the Zika virus originated, how it spread and who is most effected by the disease. Researchers are still confirming the link between Zika virus and conditions like microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, but countries where the virus is widespread -- including Brazil, Colombia and El Salvador -- are already advising women to delay pregnancy. Countries like Japan, Russia and India -- where citizens tend to place a higher value on interdependence -- are able to experience multiple emotions at once, an ability that psychologists refer to as ""emotional complexity.""People from Western countries are more likely to think that their emotions come from within themselves.Anti-abortion laws in some Zika-afflicted countries mean women who are already pregnant could face the prospect of dangerous illegal abortions if they contract the virus.""Imagine you're pregnant already, and then you discover you have this virus, and then you discover that this virus causes this condition in the fetus,"" said Anu Kumar, executive vice president of the global abortion rights non-profit IPAS. ""Then you're faced with the decision of, what do you want to do with this?""When a writer tries to ditch his electronic devices over a long holiday weekend, he hopes to become less reliant on them, but instead realizes how much his devices enhance his life.With thirty minutes remaining in the experiment, during an epic, multi-hour Boggle session, I asked my wife if she had noticed anything different about me during the past few days. She paused for a moment, and looked me up and down. ""Oh my God,"" she yelled, ""did you try to shave your eyebrows?"" Wait, what? I had not.A new proposal by the leading medical journal editors to require researchers to share their clinical trial data could encourage innovation in the industry and ward off fabricated data -- but many scientists are reluctant to share their work.Inaccessible data is a problem rife throughout medical science. Industry traditionally held its data close -- but so did academics. These researchers have felt that they deserved the right to future papers for all their hard work gathering the original data. And maybe they didn't want others examining their work.The stories we tell ourselves about why our relationships end affects how easily we can move on from romantic rejection.This rejection was like opening Pandora's Box, and concepts like love and trust became fantasies that never really existed.","huffingtonpost","left","16830","zika",529
"A new health report from the Pentagon revealed that at least 11 U.S. military personnel have been infected with the Zika virus, along with four dependents (spouses or children) of military members and two military retirees.Four of the infected people are women, although none of them are pregnant, according to USA Today's citation of Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch deputy chief Dr. Jose Sanchez. Among Zika's most alarming results is the chance of children developing microcephaly when pregnant women contract the disease.""Troops suffering from the Zika were four soldiers, three Airmen, a Marine and three members of the Coast Guard, according to Sanchez. The first confirmed case was diagnosed in late January,"" according to USA Today's summary of the report.15 of the infected individuals had traveled to South America or the Caribbean, including one who visited Brazil, where the Summer Olympics have been threatened by a Zika outbreak.It is noted that military personnel run an exceptionally high risk of mosquito bites, since they are often outdoors for long periods of time. The Pentagon has been taking precautions against Zika-carrying mosquitoes, including enhanced education about mosquito-borne illnesses for service members and their families, distributing mosquito repellent, warning against unprotected sex (a less common method of Zika transmission), and taking steps to control the mosquito population near military bases.The threat of sexual transmission is significant enough for the military to advise its personnel to consider abstaining from sex and pregnancy for eight weeks after traveling to a Zika-affected area.USA Today notes the number of infected military personnel could be much higher than reported since most people who contract Zika don't display any symptoms.Stars and Stripes reported a few weeks ago on a Pentagon memo that said mosquitoes capable of carrying the virus can be found at 190 U.S. military installations spread across 27 states and three territories.""The area the Defense Department determined could be impacted stretches from west Texas east to Florida and as far north as New York, according to the memo. It also includes Puerto Rico and Guam,"" Stars and Stripes reported.","breitbart","right","16958","zika",351
"Puerto Rico and other areas with active transmission of Zika virus can use an experimental test to screen local blood donations for the mosquito-borne disease that's been linked to serious birth defects, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday.Earlier this year, the FDA said places where Zika is circulating should get their blood samples from parts of the U.S. where the virus where it isn't spreading locally. As a result, the administration arranged to ship blood products from the mainland to Puerto Rico, which has reported more than 250 locally acquired cases.Now the island of 3.5 million people can resume collections of its own blood, so long as it uses the test manufactured by Roche Molecular Systems Inc. in New Jersey.""The availability of an investigational test to screen donated blood for Zika virus is an important step forward in maintaining the safety of the nation's blood supply, especially for those U.S. territories already experiencing active transmission,"" said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.Zika is a little-known virus that festered for decades in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region before globe-hopping to Latin America, where it has spread to more than 20 countries.Its rapid transmission has been tied to a sharp uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, or microcephaly, and Guillian-Barre syndrome, which can lead to paralysis.So far, the Centers for Disease Control has documented 273 travel-related cases in the U.S. Though Zika isn't transmitting locally within the continental U.S., scientists said that could change once temperatures climb.The Aedes aegypti mosquito is found in several southern states, and the more-prevalent Aedes albopictus mosquito also is capable of carrying the virus, so parts of the mainland may need to use the blood-screening tool.""In the future, should Zika virus transmission occur in other areas, blood collection establishments will be able to continue to collect blood and use the investigational screening test, minimizing disruption to the blood supply,"" Dr. Marks said.In February, the FDA said people who either experienced symptoms of Zika or traveled to places where the virus is spreading should refrain from donating blood for four weeks.The deferral also applies to potential donors who have had sexual contact with someone who traveled to a Zika-affected country within the last three months.President Obama has requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding to combat the Zika threat at home and aboard, though congressional Republicans say the White House should spend money left over from the Ebola fight before it seeks a massive influx of new money. ","washingtontimes","right","16890","zika",440
"Detroit Tigers pitcher Francisco Rodriguez revealed this week that he contracted Zika virus during the offseason, sparking renewed fears among Olympic athletes ahead of this summer's Rio Games.Rodriguez told ESPN on Tuesday that he caught the virus after spending time with family in and around his home city of Caracas, Venezuela. The 34-year-old said sweating through the mosquito-borne virus was much worse than a cold.""A cold, you have a sneeze, have a headache, take a couple Tylenol and you're done,"" he told ESPN. ""You don't have a cold for two weeks, you don't have a bodyache for two weeks, you don't have headaches, throwing up, weaknesses for two weeks.""Rodriguez said he was infected for about two weeks, but that his symptoms lasted for two months. Zika symptoms usually last for about a week and are similar to dengue fever.With the Olympics only two months out, Rodriguez urged athletes to do their research before they decide whether to participate, especially if they plan on having a child. Zika can lead to birth defects, as happened to a baby delivered on Tuesday in New Jersey, who was born with Zika-linked microcephaly. There is no vaccine against it.Other athletes, including tennis star Serena Williams and Chicago Bulls' Pau Gasol, have aired concerns over traveling to Rio de Janeiro, where 600,000 people are expected to gather. There's an inherent risk for infection among large crowds.Some health experts have even called for Olympics officials to delay the Games or move locations. That seems unlikely, and the World Health Organization said on Saturday that moving the Olympics wouldn't ""significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus.""Zika has been detected in over 58 countries or terrorities, including many in Central and South America.","huffingtonpost","left","16953","zika",316
"Asian Tiger mosquitoes (on the right) were responsible for dengue outbreaks in Hawaii, including in 2015. Dengue, and supposedly Zika, are usually transmitted by A. Aegypti (on the left).Zika virus is an epidemic in Puerto Rico, where some 1/4 of the population is predicted to become infected within the year, with eventually 80% getting it. Our fellow Americans will be suffering spontaneous abortions, severe birth defects (including babies born with small brains having lifelong disabilities) and even adults getting Guillan-Barre.[Thomas Frieden, CDC's Director, said] ""it's an uphill battle""  The CDC is trying to help stem the tide of Zika in Puerto Rico, he said. The agency has sped up production of kits to test for the virus and has started to distribute prevention kits. The prevention kits contain mosquito repellent and condoms, and information for women on how they can reduce their risk of infection while pregnant or planning to become pregnant, he added.Congress needs to step up with some funding. It's ridiculous that the Obama Administration had to rededicate over half a billion in Ebola funds and health infrastructure funds for Western Africa, to deal with Zika in the US. It's crazy that funding for Zika vaccines is taking from existing NIH funds, rather than having a large dedicated pot of money authorized by Congress. Negligence. This should be a major topic of conversation.the Obama administration will redirect nearly $600 million in funds, the majority from existing Ebola resources, to fight the spread of the Zika virus.""These repurposed funds are not enough to support a comprehensive Zika response and can only temporarily address what is needed until the Congress acts on the administration's emergency supplemental request,"" Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan said Wednesday.   The White House submitted that $1.9 billion request to Congress in February of this year.  Funding shortfall On Wednesday, White House officials warned that without the funding, the U.S. risks not having the ability to properly respond to the Zika virus, including delays in mosquito control and surveillance, diagnostic testing, and vaccine development.That $1.9 billion comes out to less than $6 per person.And Zika transmission is coming to the mainland this summer. Look out. Yes, it may be just pockets of sustained transmission that we can stamp out through mosquito control initiatives. Or not. This rosy scenario depends on the A. aegypti mosquito being the only efficient vector, which still makes it a downright urgent problem given its widespread distribution. But the CDC knows it's entirely possible that the Asian Tiger mosquito (A. albopictus, in green below) can transmit it; hence they made this graphic.Even ""the"" West Nile Virus mosquito (Culex family) could transmit Zika in a sustained fashion across the US (more on this possibility below). For example, in the US, West Nile Virus has been ""detected in at least 34 species of mosquitoes"" (peer-reviewed publication).West Nile Virus Activity by State - United States, 2015 (as of January 12, 2016)Fingers crossed.I'm no entomologist, but I tried to better understand the Culex mosquitoes and did find this potentially relevant map also published in peer-reviewed literature (PDF).Lots of yellow overlap. Note that the green and blue in the US do actually extend down into the yellow areas.Seriously, nobody knows for sure that Culex mosquitoes aren't efficient vectors for this strain of Zika virus.Researchers have now established that an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 was the same [Zika] strain. But the virus was not found in Aedes aegypti there, said Constancia Ayres, an entomologist studying Zika in mosquitoes in the Recife branch of Brazil's foremost public-health research institute, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz). And it wasn't found in an outbreak on the Pacific Island of Yap in 2007 either.""I believe Aedes can transmit the virus,"" she said. ""But I believe it is possible that Culex is the major vector in Brazil.""[snip]All of this matters because a public-health response must be tailored to the vector.It should be said:While experts strongly suspect Aedes aegypti is the main transmitter of the virus, they don't know for sure.Four independent mosquito experts contacted by GlobalPost confirm there's still some uncertainty. While each says it's likely that Aedes aegypti is the virus' main carrier in Latin America, they also agree it is not correct to state this as a fact.""I think it would be surprising if Aedes aegypti wasn't the main vector, but the evidence just isn't very strong yet,"" says Scott Weaver, a mosquito expert and professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch.After being pressed on the issue, a top WHO researcher also acknowledged this. The recognizable black-and-white striped mosquito is just the most likely carrier, she says, but the United Nations' health arm is not 100 percent sure, either.The CDC is openly promoting the possibility (even if it's more remote) that the Asian Tiger mosquito can transmit Zika. Their above map says it's ""more likely"" to be transmitted by the less common A. aegypti.But the realm of possibility is wide-open. One mosquito can transmit it in one place and another mosquito can transmit it in a different environment. This scenario happens all the time: just see the 2001 and the 2015 outbreaks of dengue in Hawaii that were driven by the Asian Tiger mosquito. Usually dengue is transmitted by the A. aegypti mosquito as in Puerto Rico and elsewhere. And Zika and dengue viruses are in the same family.---Hey Congress, Hey Republicans:It's an emergency.How about some urgency in working towards a financial package to deal with Puerto Rico's debts and budget shortfall? How about some stop-gap funding to deal with Zika?How about that $1.9 billion in emergency funding to scale-up vector control and preparedness efforts across the country, and actually funding research towards a vaccine (and for testing any potential antiviral drugs for the short-term response)?Hey Bernie, Hey Hillary:How about shinning a light on the lack of Congressional funding and the fucking tragedy that will unfold in Puerto Rico, with some coordinated messaging? The White House and CDC communications efforts have been drowned out by other media stories, including the back and forth of the horse race. Waiting another two months until their June primary is not going to cut it. That's two months we don't get back. Link this to global warming if you want (e.g. dengue's projected spread to the mainland). Link it to Congressional inaction on the SCOTUS nomination. I don't care. Just get on it. Now.Hey DailyKos:How about finding ways for the horse race to be leveraged into furthering important issues?Hey local governments:How about some public communications campaigns to involve your residents in mosquito control efforts?

"NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The United States Olympic Committee told U.S. sports federations that athletes and staff concerned for their health over the Zika virus should consider not going to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games in August.The message was delivered in a conference call involving USOC officials and leaders of U.S. sport federations in late January, according to two people who participated in the call.Federations were told that no one should go to Brazil ""if they don't feel comfortable going. Bottom line,"" said Donald Anthony, president and board chairman of USA Fencing.The USOC's briefing to sport federations is the latest sign that Olympics officials are taking the Zika threat to the games in Rio de Janeiro seriously, and acknowledging that at least some athletes and support staff could face a tough decision over whether to attend.The United States won most medals at the last Olympics in London in 2012, so any disruption to its presence would be important for the Rio games.Global health authorities suspect the mosquito-borne Zika virus has caused a spike in Brazil of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by an abnormally small head. As a result, the World Health Organization declared an international health emergency Feb. 1, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is advising pregnant women or those considering becoming pregnant to avoid travel to places with Zika outbreaks.The USOC's Alan Ashley, its chief of sport performance, and other USOC officials, briefed the leaders of the federations.Ashley did not respond to email or phone calls requesting comment.USOC spokesman Mark Jones confirmed by email that Ashley had ""briefed federation leaders on the CDC's recommendations and we will continue to ensure that athletes and officials affiliated with Team USA receive any updates from the CDC.""The USOC has not issued its own set of recommendations for athletes and staff beyond what the CDC and WHO have issued.Jones declined to comment further.Recalling the conference call, Anthony, a former Olympian, said: ""One of the things that they immediately said was, especially for women that may be pregnant or even thinking of getting pregnant, that whether you are scheduled to go to Rio or no, that you shouldn't go.""""And no one should go if they feel at all as though that that threat could impact them,"" said Anthony, who praised the USOC's handling of the outbreak so far.Zika outbreaks have been reported in 33 countries, most of them in the Americas. Symptoms of infection often are mild or imperceptible. But the outbreak in Brazil that began last year has been accompanied by more than 4,000 cases of suspected microcephaly; investigators have confirmed more than 400. The link to Zika is unproven but strongly suspected.In El Salvador, which is experiencing outbreaks of the virus, women are being advised to put off pregnancy until 2018.Will Connell, Director of Sport at the U.S. Equestrian Federation, said the USOC was leaving the decision up to individual athletes and staff members.""They said no one who has reasons to be concerned should feel obliged to go,"" Connell said. ""If an athlete feels that way, of course they may decide not to go.""During the call, the USOC did not indicate they were concerned that large numbers of athleteswould avoid Rio or that Zika could derail the Games, the two federation leaders said.Instead, officials expressed optimism that risk would be minimized by close cooperation among health agencies, mosquito control efforts and the Games' timing during Brazil's winter when mosquito-borne illnesses are less common.The USOC officials on the call said the organization would adhere to the recommendations of health agencies including the CDC, the sport federation leaders said.""As we get closer to the Olympics the guidance could get updated,"" Connell said.In a Jan. 29 letter from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to national committees, the IOC's chief doctors said they were monitoring the situation closely. They passed along mosquito avoidance advice, but remained confident the games would go ahead as planned.Both Connell and U.S. Fencing's Anthony said the USOC's message was focused primarily on the potential risks for women who are pregnant or are thinking about trying to become pregnant.Since the call, the CDC has issued more guidance in light of increasing suspicion that Zika can be transmitted sexually. The CDC said Friday that men who reside in or have traveled to Zika-affected areas may want to abstain from sexual activity or use condoms.The Olympics have long promised to be a triumphant showcase for Latin America, which is playing host to the global sports spectacle for the first time. Rio has also been expecting more than 380,000 tourists for the Games, which come as Brazil's economy is mired in recession and its government reels from a corruption scandal at state oil company Petrobras.An ongoing Zika epidemic could prompt some athletes, staff, sponsors and high-spending tourists to steer clear of the Games. Even if the risk of infection to any given visitor is very low - as health experts expect - uncertainties persist. There is no Zika vaccine, and currently available blood tests cannot always detect the virus.Olympics officials ""are taking the right approach from a standpoint of, let's be cautious, do not do anything that is going to put anybody, our staff or our athletes in danger,"" Anthony said.Anthony said no U.S. fencers had spoken to him about Zika.""I think our athletes are aware,"" he said. ""But it has not become a mission critical issue yet. Not yet.""UPDATE: Feb. 8 -- The US Olympic Committee on Monday issued a statement in response to Reuters' reporting:In response to inaccurate reports regarding USOC guidance for athletes attending the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio, USOC spokesperson Patrick Sandusky said:The reports that the USOC has advised U.S. athletes to reconsider competing in Rio due to the Zika virus are 100 percent inaccurate. Team USA looks forward to the Games and we did not, would not and will not prevent athletes from competing for their country should they qualify. The inaccurate report cited an internal discussion with U.S. sports leaders pertaining to employees and the potential risks that the CDC has identified with travel to Zika-infected areas.(Reporting By Daniel Bases and Joshua Schneyer; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Lisa Girion)","huffingtonpost","left","16839","zika",1075
"The U.S. is monitoring nearly 300 pregnant women with likely Zika infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, as President Obama urged Congress to ""get moving"" on funds to combat a serious outbreak.Monitors are watching 157 pregnant women in the states and 122 women in Puerto Rico and other territories, for 279 total.Zika is mosquito-borne illness that causes serious birth defects such as microcephaly, in which infants are born with abnormally small heads, and scientists are studying its ties to a syndrome that causes paralysis.""We think that there may be other neurological disorders that are caused as a consequence of Zika, and we don't know all of the potential effects. We do know that they are serious,"" Mr. Obama said Friday after a meeting with his top health officials.Mr. Obama heaped pressure on Congress to take up his $1.9 billion to plan to combat Zika, saying failure to deal with it now will result in ""bigger problems on the back end,"" though GOP leaders have crafted plans that offer far less than what he requested.Recent outbreaks in Brazil and other Latin Americans countries coincided with a significant spike in cases of microcephaly, and scientists fear that Aedes mosquitoes will spread the virus across the U.S. mainland once temperatures rise and insect populations flourish.""Mosquitoes don't go through Customs,"" Mr. Obama said.The CDC's figures on pregnant women with possible infection seemed to double overnight, but only because its reporting methods had changed.Officials said they will now keep tabs on women with any lab evidence of Zika infection - for instance, they have viral particles in them or had an immune reaction - and not just those who've shown symptoms or fetal complications.""Monitoring all pregnant women with possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy, whether asymptomatic or symptomatic, will enhance understanding of possible adverse outcomes and allow better estimates of the number of pregnancies at risk for adverse outcomes,"" the CDC scientists wrote in their report. ""This information will assist health care providers who counsel pregnant women and will facilitate planning services for affected families.""The CDC said it will begin reporting the numbers on a weekly basis and separate them into two systems - the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry and the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System in Puerto Rico.The actual outcomes of the pregnancies will be described in future reports, as scientists grapple with just how damaging the virus is to fetal development.All told, the CDC has recorded 544 travel-related cases of Zika in the states and D.C., a handful of them through sexual transmission. The territories have reported 832 cases of locally acquired Zika, most of them in Puerto Rico.Though Mr. Obama wants nearly $2 billion in emergency spending to gird for an outbreak this summer, the House passed a bill this week that redirects $622 million from the Ebola fight in West Africa and other health programs to deal with Zika.The Senate approved a bipartisan plan that would provide $1.1 billion in emergency spending that isn't paid for through cuts elsewhere in the federal budget.The chambers say they will reconcile their versions, though the White House is still pushing for $1.9 billion.""We didn't just choose the $1.9 billion from the top of our heads,"" Mr. Obama said. ""This was based on public health assessments of all the work that needs to be done.""Also Friday, the World Health Organization said the strain of Zika circulating on the Cape Verde islands off the northwest coast of Africa matches the one in the Americas and was likely imported from Brazil.""The findings are of concern because it is further proof that the outbreak is spreading beyond South America and is on the doorstep of Africa. This information will help African countries to re-evaluate their level of risk and adapt and increase their levels of preparedness,"" said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa.The agency urged African countries to gird for the disease by informing pregnant women of its dangers and promoting steps to avoid sexual transmission and mosquito bites. ","washingtontimes","right","16941","zika",680
"Since October, doctors have discovered over 7,000 Zika cases on Cape Verde, an island located off the coast of Senegal.Clinics have diagnosed 100 pregnant women with the virus, but doctors report no one has found evidence of microcephaly in any scans. Microcephaly occurs when the brain does not form properly during the pregnancy or after birth, leading to smaller than normal heads.The discoveries have instilled fear into experts that the disease might spread to Africa, returning after two Scottish scientists discovered it in Uganda 70 years ago.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) placed Cape Verde on its travel warning list at the Level 2 alert, urging travelers to ""practice enhanced precautions.""""Cape Verde has historical links with Brazil and it seems very likely it has got there from Brazil,"" explained Zika expert Nick Beeching of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.He believes the virus will land on the mainland due to ""regular flight connections from the Atlantic islands."" More than 20 breeds of mosquitoes call the continent home, but scientists report only the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are known to carry Zika. While primarily found in Africa, Aedes aegypti lives in all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere. (Chile and Canada are the exceptions.) The species also carries dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya.The World Health Organization (WHO) said the disease ""appears to have changed in character."" Mary Kay Kindhauser said the virus mutated ""as it moved through Asia - from an infection causing limited cases of mild illness to one leading to large outbreaks and, from 2013 onwards, linked to babies born with neurological disorders and abnormally small heads.""""There are a few genetic differences between the African and Asian lineages, and it looks like the Asian lineages may be better able to transmit and flourish in a human population,"" said Jimmy Whitworth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Beeching said the dengue fever caused by the mosquitoes ""had four recognized strains and there was only limited and temporary cross-protection between them."" Scientists also do not have any past evidence or cases of microcephaly or the rare Guillain-Barré syndrome, which has also been linked to Zika in South America.Following the outbreak of Zika, Brazil has discovered more than 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked an excess of 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.Brazilian doctors have asked women to delay pregnancy in light of the outbreak. ""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.Colombia has confirmed 3,100 cases of pregnant women with the Zika virus, but no cases of microcephaly. Colombian officials have also urged women to delay pregnancy due to the outbreak.""It is recommended that women postpone - to the extent possible - the decision to become pregnant until the country can move out of the epidemic phase of the Zika virus,"" pleaded the Health Ministry.","breitbart","right","16843","zika",507

"African disease control experts have offered to help Latin America combat the increasingly rapid spread of Zika virus across the Western Hemisphere. While Zika is not a threat in Africa, scientists working to combat Ebola there in the past two years hope to use methods successful against Ebola to prevent similar devastation in South America.Deutsche Welle reports that a team of six researchers from Senegal has landed in Brazil, looking to adapt their mobile Ebola diagnostic kit for Zika, so Brazilian authorities can more rapidly identify cases of Zika through door-to-door inspections.""Ebola taught us that it is possible to detect the beginning of an epidemic, but not to foresee its end,"" Dr. Amadou Alpha Sall, the head of the Senegalese team from the Pasteur Institute in Dakar said. His Ebola kit can identify the presence of the virus within 15 minutes, and runs on solar power, making it significantly more mobile for harder-to-reach communities. While Dr. Sall notes that merely identifying the virus will not stop its spread, ""if you can't identify the virus, you will have no way of telling whether the epidemic is advancing, stabilizing or ebbing.""Dr. Sall's team is working in Recife, Brazil, where medical experts are predicting that up to 100,000 people have come into contact with Zika in the past year. They do not have any way of knowing yet how many of these have actually contracted the virus.The African teams most likely to be helpful in the fight against Zika are in West Africa, where the Ebola outbreak broke out in February 2014. Ironically, they are not in Uganda, where the Zika forest gave the virus its name. While this was the first place scientists isolated the virus in the 1940s, the BBC notes that only two cases of Zika have been documented there in the past 70 years.Experts hope to study the virus's native lands, anyway, as some suspect the extremely low number of diagnosed cases does not mean the number of cases is actually low. ""It is possible that there could be several people, or so many people out there with the Zika virus infection, but because many people do not seek treatment in the hospitals, we could be missing out,"" Dr. John Kayuma, who works in Uganda, told BBC.Experts consider Africa's critical lack of medical infrastructure - and African societies' reliance on traditional herbalist healers over Western-style doctors - major factors in how Ebola managed to spread to more than 11,000 people in less than two years. Initially, many denied the existence of Ebola, while others believed it was a Western plot to control regional populations.Such a threat is significantly diminished in the developed countries of Latin America. Zika brings its own threat, however, in how difficult symptoms are to identify. Up to 80 percent of those carrying the Zika virus have no symptoms at all. Those who do have symptoms report body aches, conjunctivitis, and other mild symptoms that typically disappear within a week. Zika poses a major threat only to unborn fetuses, as doctors in Brazil have identified a link between a pregnant mother carrying Zika and her child being born with microcephaly, a severe neurological deformity in which the infant's brain is larger than his or her skull. Most pregnant women with Zika will not have significant symptoms, making it difficult to trace whether the child will be hurt.Brazil has identified 4,000 cases of infants with microcephaly related to Zika virus. The virus is expected to spread to all nations where its carrier, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, lives, including all nations in the Western Hemisphere except Canada and Chile.","breitbart","right","16829","zika",606
"Brazilian celebrity doctor Varella Varella claimed officials have banned abortion to punish poor mothers. Fear of microcephaly due to Zika and a leftist pro-abortion campaign have resulted in a spike in dangerous illegal abortions in Brazil.""Banning abortion is to punish those who have no money,"" claimed the doctor. ""I'm not a supporter of abortion and no one is. What is the woman who wants to have an abortion? It is an absurdly traumatic experience, a tragedy. It's not about that.""He also stated that money allows women to have abortions in ""reasonable conditions.""""Abortion is already free in Brazil,"" he exclaimed. ""Everything else is falsehood. Everything else is hypocrisy.""Varella shot to fame in Brazil by preaching medicine on radio programs and television shows. He branched out to social media, where he publishes videos on YouTube.Doctors indicate women in all social classes are seeking out these abortions ""in despair over the possibility of deformity."" Some even go through with abortions without concrete proof of complications.""Rich women normally do and nothing ever happens. Have you ever seen them being arrested for it?"" continued the doctor. ""Now the poor woman, the wife of the slum, that thickens statistics.""Planned Parenthood and leftist politicians have argued that easier access to abortion will help contain the damage the Zika virus is causing in Latin America.""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,"" wrote sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy in O Globo, another national publication.Doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester or after birth:Brazil has outlawed abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger. A judge must approve exceptions.Varella admitted doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester and that a child can survive if born that early.""In microcephaly, the definitve diagnosis is generally close to the third trimester,"" he explained. ""You take a fetus at seven months and it is almost born. But of course I respect any decision.""He added, ""The important thing is to give freedom to those who think differently. This is the fundamental issue of abortion.""Virologist Gubio Soares, who first identified the presence of the pervasive Zika virus in Brazil, suggested that legalized abortion in French Polynesia may have prevented scientists from uncovering a link between Zika and severe infant deformities sooner.During a lecture, Soares claimed scientists do not know for sure if a link exists between Zika and microcephaly. This is mainly because women in places where Zika breeds often aborted children who showed signs of microcephaly, a disorder now linked to the virus. Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth, causing a small skull. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.Soares suggested that legalized abortion in French Polynesia may have prevented scientists from uncovering the crucial link between Zika and the disorder.Journalist Ana Carolina Caceres, 24, told the BBC doctors did not think she would survive after she was born with microcephaly.""I grew up, went to school, graduated, and went to university,"" she boasted.

"Pope Francis receives a cross made by an inmate during his visit to the CeReSo n. 3 penitentiary in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on Wednesday.On a flight from Mexico to Rome Thursday after a six-day trip that included a visit to Cuba, Pope Francis told reporters that using contraception to avoid infecting fetuses with the Zika virus is better than abortions to terminate pregnancies in which the fetus is infected. The virus has been linked to some cases of microcephaly in newborns. The pope called abortion an ""absolute evil"" and a ""crime"" and reiterated the church's stance that it is always wrong:""It is to kill someone in order to save another. This is what the Mafia does,"" Francis said. ""On the other hand, avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil.""The Pope then pointed to a narrow exception to the church's ban on most forms of birth control: His predecessor, Pope Paul VI, allowed African nuns who were raped to use contraception, Francis said. He did not explain why and what forms of birth control were used.""In certain cases ... such as the one I mentioned of Blessed Paul VI, it was clear,"" the Pope said. It was Paul VI who wrote ""Humanae Vitae,"" the papal document that solidified the church's stance against almost every form of birth control in 1968. The church does allow natural family planning, which involves a woman monitoring her basal body temperature and vaginal secretions to avoid having sex at fertile times of the month.That is likely to encourage health officials in Latin America but irk Catholic conservatives who view the church's teaching that anything which works to ""'render procreation impossible' is intrinsically evil."" While ""pro-life"" Catholic activists take a hard stance on the matter, regardless of the circumstances, other highly placed Catholics do not:""The polemical approach, that contraception is devious or demonic in origin or the smoke of Satan, may ultimately not be the best pastoral approach,"" said the Rev. James Bretzke, a professor of theology at Boston College.And among the Catholic rank and file, CNN religious editor Daniel Burke notes, the attitude in Latin America is very much at odds with the Vatican's overall stance on contraception. A poll by the Spanish-language network Univision found that 88 percent of Mexicans, 91 percent of Colombians and 93 percent of Brazilians support the use of contraceptives.In another break from his predecessors, the pope also told reporters on the overnight flight that Catholic lawmakers are free to vote for same-sex marriage and civil unions. In 2003, then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, approved a document from the Vatican's doctrinal office-which he then ran-categorically forbidding Catholic legislators from voting for same-sex marriage or unions. Pope Francis's change not quite Vatican approval of marriage equality, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.","dailykos","left","16849","zika",474
"WASHINGTON -- Truck driver Dana Logan tried on Wednesday to recount a crash that decapitated two fathers and two children, hoping to convince Congress to stop weakening rules that require truckers to get rest.She couldn't do it. A dozen years after the fatigued driver of another truck fell asleep and drove into an SUV stuck in traffic behind her rig on a Texas highway, Logan was still too devastated to finish talking about it.She drives trucks with her husband, Tim, as a team. That June day in 2004 near Sulphur Springs, the other driver fell asleep and rammed the SUV, pushing it under the carriage of Logan's trailer, shearing off the top half of the vehicle with its four helpless passengers inside.Logan got as far as recalling how her husband rushed to help the other trucker.""When Tim tried the get the injured driver out of the truck, he [the other driver] asked him, 'Did I hit something?' Those were his last words before he died,"" Logan told reporters in a conference call aimed at legislation moving in Congress this week.Sobbing, Logan had to stop. She asked her husband to finish.What the Logans and other safety advocates are worried about are measures that would allow truck drivers to work more than 80 hours a week, tacked onto to separate appropriations bills in the House and the Senate.The Senate on Thursday passed a measure that allows 73 hours of driving and an additional 8.5 hours on related work each week as part of a massive spending measure that will fund transportation, housing and military construction projects, as well as the Veterans Administration. Funding for Zika prevention was also added to that bill, making it very likely to pass.In the House, measures were added to the transportation and housing appropriations bill under consideration in the committee that set similar rest rules, reverting to regulations originally set in the Bush administration that were repeatedly challenged and thrown out in lawsuits.Both bills would prevent the Obama administration from enforcing a regulation that briefly went into effect in 2013 that effectively capped truck drivers' working hours at 70 a week, and ensured they could have two nights off in a row. That rule was blocked by a rider in a 2014 spending bill, which had to pass to avert a government shutdown.The newly inserted policy provisions represent a trend over the last three years of the trucking industry using must-pass spending bills to win regulatory concessions that are opposed by most safety advocates and likely could not pass as normal stand-alone bills. In this case, not only do the bills fund major parts of the government, they provide cash to fight Zika.""There's not been any congressional hearings on any of these proposals,"" said Jackie Gillian, the president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. ""The trucking industry doesn't want to have hearings, they don't want to hear from truck drivers like Dana Logan. They don't want to hear from victims.""They know that if they do have testimony and they have the experts up there, the people affected, that they would see how illogical and insane these proposals are,"" Gillian said.Those trucking interests see the complaints of safety advocates as illogical.On the rest requirements, known as hours-of-service rules, the industry believes advocates are inventing problems.""There's this claim by these anti-truck groups that drivers are abusing it. There's no data showing that,"" said Dave Osiecki, who is in charge of public advocacy at the American Trucking Associations.Osiecki argued that it's nearly impossible for drivers to string together their hours to hit the 80-plus hour maximums that are theoretically allowed under the rules that the trucking provisions in both spending bills would preserve. ""We just don't see a need for it,"" he said of the tougher Obama administration standard with two nights off.The ATA maintains that the Obama rules don't improve safety, and even worsen it, while the older rules, with one night off, do improve safety.Nevertheless, police who enforce the highway safety laws do think there is a connection between getting more sleep and safety.One is Illinois Trooper Douglas Balder. Balder was nearly burned alive when a truck driver completely ignored the rules, and drove into the back of Balder's patrol car. Balder, also a military veteran, spent months in rehab to get back on the beat. He doesn't want Congress rolling back safety rules, and joined Wednesday's conference call to say so.""I continue to take to the road every day to do my part to protect the people and ensure the law is upheld,"" Balder said. ""I cannot do my job alone. I urge Congress to take necessary action to ensure our safety, not to put us further at risk.""The White House has threatened to veto the Senate spending bill, in part because of the rest rule rollback. But the prospect of a veto is less likely with the Zika measure attached.Three senators, Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) had hoped to offer an amendment in debate Thursday to restore the Obama rest regulations, but they were not given a chance amid the back-and-forth around Zika and other pressing matters surrounding the larger legislation. Democrats tried to remove Zika funding from the bill on Wednesday, but were blocked.Blumenthal took to the floor briefly to complain about being shut out.""We need to make truck drivers, in effect, more safely empowered on the roads to take steps to protect themselves,"" Blumenthal said. ""Drivers who spend too much time behind the wheel are tired. They can't drive as safely.""This article was updated after publication to include news of the Senate bill's passage, reference a study that supports the American Trucking Associations' position, and include a quote from Sen. Richard Blumenthal.   ","huffingtonpost","left","16940","zika",1057
"Brazil's tourism industry is already suffering from the international alarm over the Zika virus outbreak that has infected 1.5 million people, with tour operators and hotel bookers experiencing an increase in the number of cancellations, particularly on the part of pregnant women who were planning to travel.Brazilian newspaper O Globo reports that, while tour operators attempted to appear optimistic that the number of tourists canceling their trips will diminish as scientists begin to further understand the viral outbreak, they have received a number of ""cancellation requests or travel postponements from foreign tourists, mostly pregnant women and caregivers."" Tourist agencies like Blumar tell the newspaper they have seen less than 1 percent of their bookings cancelled, most spurred on by the fact that a number of airlines have offered free cancellation of flights to pregnant women traveling to Zika areas.""Aspects such as those related to security have a strong impact on the country's image abroad. But dengue and zika raised it to a new level. We must act responsibly and quickly as it is a situation that burns the image of Brazil and its various destinations out there,"" consultant Tricia Neves told O Globo, adding that many are concerned that scientists will discover that Zika is transmittable through other means than the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. So far, scientists have found that Zika can live in human saliva and urine, though they have not found proof that it is transmittable through those bodily fluids.Brazil has confirmed multiple cases of Zika transmission through blood transfusion, and the United States has confirmed one case of Zika transmission through sexual contact.The Zika virus typically does not cause the carrier to experience any symptoms; only 20 percent of those who contract it do. Of these, a minority have been diagnosed with the rare Guillain-Barré syndrome, which causes paralysis, severe muscle pain, and death.Brazilian medical experts have found a link between Zika and the infant deformity microcephaly, which causes severe neurological problems many infants do not survive for more than a few days. This has triggered alarm surrounding pregnant women who are considering traveling to the affected areas of Latin America.""There is a very important concern in all of America  there is a significant number of Argentine tourists going to viral circulation zones, like northern Brazil and Colombia,"" Jorge Lemus, Argentina's health minister, said this week, expressing a widespread concern that travelers may give the mosquito-borne virus an easy avenue through which to cross major bodies of water to other regions. That concern has trickled down to local populations. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that, of those who are aware of the Zika virus outbreak, 41 percent say they are less likely to travel to affected regions.The World Bank estimates that Brazil could take a $64 billion hit in its tourism industry if the trend continues, which would be devastating to a nation already facing its worst recession of the past century. The Guardian notes that many are alarmed by the possibility that tourism to the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro may be affected. So far, Brazil has reached 74 percent of the target income it is expecting from ticket sales, though the sale of tickets to Paralympian events has been slower than expected.","breitbart","right","16842","zika",548

"An Aedes Aegypti mosquito is photographed on human skin in a lab of the International Training and Medical Research Training Center (CIDEIM) on January 25, 2016, in Cali, Colombia. (AFP)Colombia's health authorities said Friday that three people had died after contracting the Zika virus, which may be responsible for the development of the rare nerve disorder called Guillain-Barre. This is the first time health officials have directly blamed the mosquito-borne disease for fatalities.According to a report from Aljazeera, Martha Lucia Ospina, head of the National Health Institute confirmed the findings to AFP:""We have confirmed and attributed three deaths to ZikaIn this case, the three deaths were preceded by Guillain-Barre syndrome.""Guillain-Barre is a rare disorder that causes the immune system to attack the nervous system. Symptoms can include paralysis, and many who fall victim to the disorder require hospitalization for treatment. The timing and correlation has raised some health officials' concerns that the neurological condition is a complication of the mosquito-borne virus that has spread across Latin America. Zika has also been blamed for an increase in the number of babies born with microcephaly, which causes abnormally small heads and brains, after a spike in babies born in Brazil with the condition.Although most Guillain-Barre patients recover, the syndrome can be deadly. Ospina, who also works as an epidemiologist, said another six deaths were under investigation for a possible Zika link:""Other cases (of deaths linked to Zika) are going to emergeThe world is realizing that Zika can be deadly.

"The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with this birth defect have smaller heads and sometimes brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean, and with the high volume of news about the virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.Here are four updates, opinions and developments to know about now:  Over 6,000 pregnant women in Colombia have Zika virus, and now the country is reporting its first ""probable"" microcephaly case, reports Reuters. Health officials said that the virus was present in the amniotic fluid of an aborted fetus, and the fetus, at 28 weeks, was severely deformed. Unfortunately, the fetal remains were improperly discarded, which means the country's health officials cannot confirm the condition or that the fetus was infected with Zika virus.The country has established new protocol for tracking pregnant women who test positive for Zika virus, reports NPR. It includes monthly ultrasounds and the careful collection of data about the point of time in their pregnancy the women got Zika virus. Scientists around the world are watching Colombia as more of the women with Zika virus continue to progress in their pregnancies and give birth. The results could help to confirm whether or not Zika virus is responsible for causing severe birth defects in babies.Director-General Margaret Chan of the World Health Organization warned that the Zika virus outbreak might gets worse before it gets better, and that means Brazil may continue to see more babies born with microcephaly, reports Reuters. So far, Brazil has confirmed 583 cases of microcephaly, and officials are still investigating more than 4,000 other cases. The WHO also put forth recommendations on breastfeeding after Zika virus. Because there's no evidence babies can get the disease via their mother's breast milk, women who have tested positive for the disease in the past should continue breastfeeding their infants, reports AP. The guidelines, released Thursday, align with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations released last week. Both agencies said that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risk of Zika virus transmission. The primary mode of Zika virus transmission is via mosquito bites, but sexual transmission of the disease is also possible.Two travelers who visited the Caribbean returned to the Czech Republic with the disease, while one teen who visited Brazil was diagnosed with Zika virus in Japan. While this is Japan's first Zika virus case linked to the current outbreak, the country has seen three other cases in previous years, all in travelers returning from French Polynesia and Thailand, reports Reuters.A couple of interesting new polls gauge Americans' awareness of the international outbreak. The Kaiser Health Tracking poll, released Thursday, finds that about six in 10 Americans are closely following news about the outbreak, and that the same ratio of Americans has also read or heard at least something about the disease. Three-fourths say that they know it is passed via mosquito bite, more than half know it can also be sexually transmitted, and seven in ten know it can't be spread just by shaking someone's hands. Six in 10 also know that there are cases of Zika virus in the U.S., and that the disease may be linked to birth defects. Finally, 43 percent of respondents said they were ""very"" or ""somewhat"" worried that the U.S. will have a large number of Zika virus cases in the next year. Meanwhile, an Annenberg Science Knowledge poll on Zika virus found that more than one-third of Americans said they believed the untrue conspiracy theory that genetically modified mosquitoes caused the spread of Zika virus. About four in ten of the respondents also incorrectly believed that someone who gets Zika virus has a high risk of dying. In fact, the disease is very mild and rarely requires hospitalization.","huffingtonpost","left","16856","zika",694

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 153 cases of Zika in the U.S. as of March 2.Though no cases of Zika transmission by mosquito have been reported in the U.S., just a month ago reports came in that aggressive Aedes aegypti mosquitos known to carry the virus were infesting Orange County in southern California.February also brought confirmation of the first sexually transmitted case of Zika in the U.S.. Dallas County health officials announced the case on February 2.San Francisco's newly infected Zika patient is not pregnant, while the other Bay area case was a pregnant Napa County woman. Health officials warn that Zika may be related to the birth defect microcephaly and urge pregnant women to avoid travel to countries hard-hit with the disease, including many South and Central American countries. Men infected with Zika can spread the disease through sexual contact. The Zika virus lives longer in semen than in blood. No evidence has surfaced that women could spreading the virus.Symptoms of Zika may or may not be detected in those infected, but can include fever, joint pain, rash and red eyes according to a statement from San Francisco Department of Public Health released in the KRON news report. Cases of the disease have also cropped up across California in Napa, Yolo, Los Angeles and San Diego counties. on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16865","zika",305
"Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency over the Zika virus threat in four counties on Wednesday, saying that he wanted state resources prepared for the possibility that Zika could begin spreading through Florida's mosquito population.""Although Florida's current nine Zika cases were travel-related, we have to ensure Florida is prepared and stays ahead of the spread of the Zika virus in our state,"" read a statement from Scott. ""Our Department of Health will continue to be in constant communication with all county health offices, hospitals and the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We know that we must be prepared for the worst even as we hope for the best.""ABC News reports that Scott has ordered the Florida Department of Health to ""take any action necessary to protect public health,"" and gives the Florida Commissioner of Agriculture, Adam Putnam, authority to issue a ""mosquito declaration"" to reduce insect populations in the affected counties.The public health emergency order covers Miami-Dade, Lee, Hillsborough, and Santa Rosa counties, according to CBS News.As Governor Scott mentioned, there have been nine confirmed cases of Zika in Florida so far, all of them international travelers who recently visited the outbreak zones in Latin America and the Caribbean. Of the 48 total cases reported in the United States to date, only one appears to be an example of ""local transmission,"" i.e. contracting Zika while inside the U.S.CBS reports that none of the Florida cases were pregnant women, the group believed to be most at risk from Zika infections because the otherwise mild virus has been tentatively linked to birth defects in unborn children.The chief medical correspondent for CBS News, Dr. Jon LaPook, said he thought the emergency declaration was an ""attempt to stay ahead of the problem by lowering the odds that Zika virus will enter the local mosquito population in Florida.""Another precaution mentioned in the CBS report involved hospitals in South Florida asking pregnant women if they have traveled to the Zika outbreak areas in South America, and advising them against doing so.Florida authorities may be especially nervous about Zika because it is primarily borne by mosquitoes, which Florida has a notorious surplus of. On the other hand, Florida has long experience with controlling the insect population.""One of the things that makes us in Florida a little bit safer is that we have much better mosquito control mechanisms,"" said Florida International University assistant professor of biology Matthew DeGennaro, quoted by the Miami Herald. ""We live in homes that have screens and have air conditioning We kind of prevent access of the mosquitoes to people in ways that are not happening in, let's say, Northeast Brazil, where people are a lot more impoverished.""","breitbart","right","16835","zika",462
"While it may not be the most widespread Zika conspiracy theory on the internet, it's certainly among the weirdest. The fact-checking website Snopes revealed last Wednesday that at least a few people falsely believe Americans are immune to Zika virus, as these tweets demonstrate:  Say NO to more Obama requested FAKE #Zika virus funding. American immune systems are immune to it. Virus isn't new dont spread propaganda about a non-existent threat to Americans Fake Zika war is a terrorist tacticeSuch claims are completely unfounded, according to Derek Gatherer, a lecturer at Lancaster University in the U.K. who studies virus genetics. Asked if there is any scientific evidence that Americans might be immune to Zika virus, he replied, ""None whatsoever.""But Zika conspiracy theorist Chad, above, is right about one thing: The virus isn't new. It was discovered in rhesus monkeys in the Ugandan forest in 1947, and is common in Africa and Asia. And some people do have Zika antibodies that indicate they're likely immune to the virus -- they just aren't Americans.""If people haven't been immunized or vaccinated against Zika but they have antibodies to Zika, it means that the virus must have gotten into them at one time or another in their lives,"" Ahmed Kalebi, CEO of Lancet Laboratories in East Africa, told Newsweek.In Kenya, scientists have encountered individuals with Zika antibodies -- likely because of continued exposure to the virus. In Uganda, a different subspecies of mosquito carries the virus, but doesn't tend to bite humans. In fact, there have only been two confirmed cases of people getting sick from Zika in Uganda over seven decades, according to the BBC, though many people in Uganda haven't been tested.However, since Zika has only recently been detected in North and South America, people in the Western Hemisphere do not have immunity to it.""There's no evidence that I'm aware of that Americans would be immune to  Zika,"" infectious disease expert David Calfee concluded during a Facebook Livestream with The Huffington Post on Thursday. ""A number of Americans have traveled to Zika-affected areas and have gotten infected.""At last count, there were 591 travel-acquired cases of Zika virus in the United States and 168 pregnant women with Zika, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Tuesday, a baby was born in New Jersey with microcephaly, a Zika-linked birth defect. Humans fear uncertainty.""The world is a big, scary, strange, random place,"" said Eric Oliver, a political science professor at the University of Chicago who studies conspiracy theories. ""People like to put some order and make some sense of it.""  ""It's easier for us to fabricate a monster we can identify than accept that there are some unknowns out there,"" he added.Health issues are a particularly popular source of conspiracy theories, since illness affects everyone and involves uncertainty. Indeed, in a survey Oliver conducted that was published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014, nearly half of Americans believe in at least one medical conspiracy theory -- such as the debunked claim that there's a link between vaccines and autism or that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is withholding a natural cancer cure because of its ties to Big Pharma.Such misguided beliefs can have practical consequences. Earlier this year, a review funded by the National Institutes of Health found that rising measles and whooping cough rates in the U.S. correlated with a refusal to get vaccines.For Oliver, the fracture in American society isn't between liberals and conservatives; it's between rationalists and intuitionists. Rationalists base their world views on science and reason, while ""intuitionists tend to follow their gut,"" Oliver said. ""The ideas of the Enlightenment don't hold a lot of utility for them.""Vaccine avoidance certainly fits this formula. Vaccination itself is counterintuitive: It involves inserting a foreign pathogen into one's body to avoid future illness. For parents of children with autism, it may be easier to believe that a vaccine -- rather than an unknowable constellation of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors -- caused their child's disorder.The sticky thing about individuals who buy into conspiracy theories is that they don't trust experts or research -- the main tools we have to debunk what's not true.One danger on the internet is confirmation bias: People tend to consume and focus on information that confirms the views they already hold. These days, there's a blog or a Reddit thread that confirms just about any alternative viewpoint you could cook up.There's also what's know as the ""backfire effect,"" which two political scientists documented in 2006. When people are confronted with accurate information that debunks their beliefs, they don't usually change their minds. Instead, they dig in their heels and develop an even stronger belief in the veracity of their discredited opinion.To bridge the gap, Oliver suggests trying to empathize, rather than rationalize, with conspiracy theorists.  ""Acknowledge that, yes, they have anxiety, they have fears, they have discomfort,"" he said. ""Our immediate inclination is to dismiss or disregard people who have conspiracy theories. We think of them as a signal of some sort of psychological aberration. Really, what they are doing is something that's pretty natural and intuitive and probably just motivated by a great deal of apprehension.""","huffingtonpost","left","16954","zika",905

"You know that sound of a rogue mosquito buzzing in your ear at night as you try to sleep? That's what listening to Sen. Ted Cruz sanctimoniously make his case for the presidency is like during Republican debates. So this past Thursday, when Ben Carson started talking, like everyone else, I tuned out and thought about other things, like the causality dilemma of what came first, the mosquito or the 2016 Republican candidate?It can't possibly be a coincidence that swarms of blood-thirsty Republicans are stinging us relentlessly with harsh talk, competing for headlines with Zika-virus infected mosquitoes. Mother Nature is telling us something, folks. We elect any one of these guys at our peril.What came first, the mosquito or the 2016 Republican candidate?Zika causes shrunken heads and incomplete brain development, but that's not the only thing it has in common with the 2016 slate of Republican candidates. Both kinds of pests are particularly dangerous to women.The front-runners on stage Thursday at the Big Boy debate confirmed that ""conservative"" has nothing to do with size of government, really, it's code for sanctimony. Bret Baier of Fox News teed up an easy shrink-government question for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, but instead of talking about reducing corporate welfare or tightening the belt of the beltway's bureaucracy, Christie went with a Hail Mary.Baier: ""Governor Christie, you talk a lot about entitlement reform and you say that that's where the federal government can get savings needed to balance the budget. But can you name even one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all?""Christie: ""How about one that I've done in New Jersey for the last six years. That's get rid of Planned Parenthood funding from the United States of America.""Yes, rein in birth control, because who doesn't want an economy like New Jersey? The worst state in which to do business, according to the Tax Foundation, and the sixth-worst state economy overall.Republican presidential candidates are crusading for evangelical votes and trumpeting their holier-than-Hillary creds louder and louder, and as they angle for the farthest right seat at the table, let us pray these guys are served their last supper come November. Otherwise I believe women are in serious trouble. Look at places like El Salvador and other Latin American countries where ultra-right, ""religious"" men govern. There the Zika virus is rampant, birth control is scarce and abortion is illegal. Rape of teenage girls is horrifyingly common. So that country did what any self-righteous ultra-conservative government would do under a Zika virus epidemic: declare that women and girls should simply not get pregnant.Think about that for a minute, and then think about America under a Marco Rubio presidency.What would ""the Republican savior,"" who's made it clear he opposes abortion under all circumstances - with no exception for rape or incest - do if he were president and the Zika virus became an epidemic in the United States?""In the end, my goal is not simply to live on this Earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator. And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do,"" he said Thursday, cementing earlier statements that under no circumstance should a girl or woman be allowed to end a pregnancy.In other words, ladies, tough luck. Your constitutional rights be damned.To listen to this season's Republican debates, one must employ magical thinking or have a high degree of tolerance for group-think gone bad. Sure, Jeb Bush knows what he's talking about and John Kasich isn't a moron, but their voices are drowned out by bellicosity and bravado.Trump: We're gonna build a huge wall and be great again! I will make a deal with Putin and China. And so what? I called women fat pigs, slobs, dogs and disgusting animals - shut up, Bimbo.Cruz: We shall carpet-bomb the bejesus out of ISIS. Amen.Ron Paul: Zygotes will win civil rights cases in federal court if you elect me.Chorus: More guns will make us safe. Climate change is a hoax. Income inequality is inevitable. White collar crime is a cost of doing business. Corporations are people.What really bugs me, though, is the failure of the Republican Party to govern itself through this bizarre nominating process while maintaining the hubris that any one of its candidates deserves to occupy the most powerful seat in the world.I watched the Republicans debate on Thursday and every time before that and I report to you that the Lord of the Flies is running for president while mosquitoes are taking over the world.Americans everywhere, take cover or take action.","huffingtonpost","left","16832","zika",811
"Everything is better when the government just stands aside, right? Republicans are providing their latest example of this truism by blowing every possible chance to do anything about the Zika virus. Instead they are gifting every county, city, town, and individual with the joy that comes with responsibility.Cases of the mosquito-transmitted disease have now been detected in 45 states and all three U.S. territories - and the threat is only growing. On Tuesday, the first Zika-infected woman in the mainland U.S. gave birth to a baby with microcephaly, the fetal brain deformity linked to Zika. But federal lawmakers may be too late to make a substantial impact to stem the spread of the virus. Although health experts have been raising the alarm for months, Congress recently broke for vacation without passing a comprehensive funding bill to help states prepare for the epidemic.Mosquitos and viruses may be partying now, but that's only because they don't realize the Randian force generated by leaving every person in the country exposed to a godawful disease. Just outside the walls of the Capitol rests one of the hundreds of communities waiting for federal aid. Washington D.C. is a humid haven for millions of mosquitoes during its coming summer months. In lieu of congressional support, D.C. health officials have taken the battle into their own hands, working in part with the CDC to create a ""Comprehensive Zika Action Plan.""Without funding, support, or a national plan, each community has to devise its own response-and its own dollars-to stem the spread of the virus. It's a race against time as temperatures warm and the species of mosquitos known to carry the virus spread. But every pregnant woman in America will surely want to thank Republicans for giving them this opportunity for personal growth.","dailykos","left","16958","zika",300
"The Department of Health and Human Services is seeking to transfer $510 million in money allocated to fighting the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in west Africa to preventing a similar outbreak of Zika in the United States, officials announced Wednesday.""We have two global public health crises, Ebola and Zika, and we can't set one aside to deal with the other,"" Health and Human Services Director Sylvia Burwell told reporters Wednesday. While some Zika cases have been documented in Africa, the majority of those in what medical experts have called a pandemic are occurring in Brazil and throughout Latin America. As the weather warms in the Northern Hemisphere, many fear a similar outbreak could occur in the United States.ABC News reported Tuesday night that the White House would likely make the move to attempt to allocate Ebola funding towards Zika research, noting that President Barack Obama had previously asked Congress to appropriate $1.9 billion to Zika prevention and awareness, but the process to have that money approved will be long, and health officials are demanding precautionary measures take place as soon as possible.White House officials nonetheless reiterated that they hope to see Congress pass an appropriations bill to fund even more Zika research despite this latest move. ""Today we reiterate our call on Congress to take immediate action to provide the full requested amount. We must scale up Zika prevention activity right now,"" White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) director Shaun Donovan told reporters. ""Nearly two months have passed and the situation continues to grow more critical.""Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and Florida have all declared states of emergency over the Zika outbreak. Zika is transmitted through the bite of the aedes aegypti mosquito, which thrives in hot, humid climates.NBC notes that America has documented almost 700 Zika cases, about half of which occurred in Puerto Rico. At least 64 of these cases have been pregnant women, who are particularly vulnerable to the damage Zika can cause. While Zika infection itself causes mild symptoms - and is asymptomatic in 80 percent of cases - health experts have found that the virus has the capacity to cause severe neurological damage in an unborn child. Zika has been linked to microcephaly, a deformity in which the infant's brain is crushed by an underdeveloped skull. Publicity surrounding the potential of Zika to cause brain damage in infants has led some American women to choose to abort their pregnancies rather than give birth to a special needs child. It has also led an increasing number of women to request a Zika test from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to confirm whether they are carrying the virus (most cases have been negative).The precise link between Zika and microcephaly remains little understood, however. Brazil is currently investigating 5,000 cases of microcephaly linked to Zika, but Colombia - which has been similarly hard-hit by Zika - has documented little more than 30. In other parts of Latin America, microcephaly remains uncommon, but Zika patients are being diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a rare neurological disorder causing intense muscular pain, paralysis, and death in adults.While the number of Zika cases is skyrocketing, reappropriating Ebola funds to fight a new virus leaves many questions unanswered regarding international aid for the ongoing Ebola fight. While the disease is spreading at a much slower rate than at the outbreak's height in 2014, Guinea and Liberia are still documenting deaths due to Ebola. In the most recent flare-up, Guinea has recorded eight deaths so far. Most alarmingly, the government of Guinea has identified 1,300 people who have had contact with the eight Ebola victims, and 242 ""high-risk contacts.""Ebola has also returned to Liberia through a woman who traveled to Monrovia from Guinea after her husband died of unknown causes. Her three children are being closely monitored for Ebola symptoms, and one has tested positive for Ebola so far. Liberia has identified 84 potential cases in individuals who have had contact with the affected family. Liberia had initially closed its border with Guinea following news of the first new Ebola case, but later reopened it.While Sierra Leone, the third west African country affected by the Ebola outbreak, has yet to document a new case, its government is on high alert. Sierra Leone's Awareness Times reported on Monday that President Ernest Koroma has reactivated Ebola emergency response mechanisms and deployed military aid to border police to help with screening and surveillance of potential Ebola cases attempting to cross the border.","breitbart","right","16897","zika",743
"Dallas County health officials confirmed its first sexually transmitted Zika virus case on Tuesday, Feb. 2.Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) released a statement that lab results returned to them from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) came back positive for a patient who was infected with the virus after having sexual contact with an individual sick with Zika virus disease. The person ill with Zika virus returned from a country where the virus exists.""Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,"" said Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director. ""Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any sexually-transmitted infections.""The most common and relatively mild symptoms of the disease are fever, rash, joint pain and red eye. They last several days to a week. DCHHS advises individuals with these symptoms to visit their doctor if they have visited an area where Zika virus is present or had sexual contact with a person who traveled to an area where the virus is present. There is no specific medication available to treat Zika virus and, as Breitbart News reported, there is no vaccine. The best way to prevent Zika virus is to avoid mosquito bites and to avoid sexual contact with a person who has the illness.""Education and awareness is crucial in preventing Zika virus,"" said Dr. Christopher Perkins, DCHHS medical director/health authority. ""Patients are highly encouraged to follow prevention recommendations to avoid transmitting and spreading Zika virus.""The DCHHS notes that sexual partners can protect each other by using condoms to prevent spreading sexually-transmitted infections.Dallas County health officials also advise there are currently no reports of Zika virus locally-transmitted by mosquitoes in Dallas County, although the DCHHS cautions these travel-related cases can make local spread by mosquitoes possible. DCHHS advises recent travelers with Zika virus symptoms and individuals diagnosed with Zika virus to protect themselves from further mosquito bites.Medical experts warn the virus has ""explosive"" pandemic potential. On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus and its suspected link to birth defects a ""global health emergency."" Experts also suspect a connection between Zika virus and serious birth defects. During Brazil's 2015 Zika virus outbreak, incidences of microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with small heads and abnormally deformed brains, increased.Breitbart Texas reported the CDC advised pregnant women to avoid traveling to the 24 countries seeing high rates of the virus in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare paralysis disease, also increased during the 2014 French Polynesia Zika virus outbreak.

"Brazil and the University of Texas signed an agreement to develop a Zika Virus vaccine. The vaccine may be on the way sooner than many health experts anticipated.The goal is to have the vaccine ready for clinical trials within a year and market-ready in three years.The Associated Press reported Brazilian Health Minister Marcelo Castro announced the deal Thursday, saying that the Brazilian government will invest $1.9 million in the research. The research project will be jointly conducted by the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston and the Evandro Chagas Institute in the Amazonian city of Belem.Brazilian officials previously said any Zika vaccine could take as many as five years. However, on Thursday, Castro said he was more optimistic, commenting it could be ready for distribution within three years. Previously, Breitbart News reported scientists believed an FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approved vaccine might be at least a decade away, although an emergency shot could be available by year's end.Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported UTMB was the largest research center for arboviruses vaccines. The Zika virus, like Dengue fever, yellow fever, West Nile virus, and encephalitis all fall under the heading of arboviruses, which means they emanate from arthropods such as mosquitoes and ticks.According to the Associated Press, Castro said the Health Ministry also reached vaccine partnerships with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and looks forward to working with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline because of its role in developing a vaccine against Ebola after the 2014 West African deadly outbreak.Zika virus is a mild illness for most people, although Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare paralysis disease, increased during the 2014 French Polynesia Zika virus outbreak. However, pregnant women are most at-risk. Brazil's Zika outbreak sparked a public health crisis. Researchers suspect a link to such devastating birth defects as microcephaly, where the in utero baby's brain stops developing. Breitbart News reported Brazilian medical experts documented more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly, diagnosing 200 cases per week. Zika also may be connected to other poor pregnancy outcomes including vision birth defects.Castro noted: ""This isn't just Brazil's concern; it's the world's concern.""In the United States, the CDC issued travel advisory warnings for pregnant women to the Zika affected Latin American countries and Caribbean islands. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported between January 2014 and Feb. 5, 2016, 33 countries with Zika virus cases and ""indirect evidence of local transmission in six additional countries.""Castro said WHO chief Margaret Chan is expected to visit Brazil on Feb. 23 to help coordinate the government's response with other agencies around the world. An initial delegation of 15 researchers from the CDC arrive in Brazil on Friday, according to AP.On Feb. 10, health experts testified before the Texas House of Representatives Public Health Committee suggesting the Lone Star State was poised to lead the charge in developing a Zika virus vaccine. Said Jennifer Herricks, postdoctoral fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy and the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine: ""Texas has some of the best biomedical researchers in the world."" She added that the state has the largest medical center in the world as well as experts on tropical medicine ""at our disposal,"" Austin ABC-TV affiliate KVUE reported.Dallas County health officials also announced plans to begin testing for Zika virus in their lab as soon as next week to ""help get faster turnaround on tests for pregnant women who have traveled from those endemic countries,"" said the county's Health and Human Services (DCHHS) Director Zachary Thompson. In response to this news, Governor Greg Abbott tweeted ""Texas is leading the effort to control Zika virus.""Texas reported three new Zika cases this week. It braces for more test results still pending from the CDC. The only known sexually transmitted case of Zika in the U.S., to date came out of Dallas where a patient had contact with an infected partner who recently traveled to Venezuela. Last week, Abbott appointed a 31 member infectious disease preparedness and response task force to address the virus.The most recent figures from the CDC show the 52 travel-related Zika cases in the United States. Nine additional cases came out of Puerto Rico and one in the U.S. Virgin Islands.U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper added the Zika virus to the list of infectious diseases threatening the nation, which include Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola.

"Seventeen members of Congress, including two powerful committee chairmen from Texas, have asked President Obama to raise travel warnings to Level 3 for countries with high levels of the Zika virus.Science, Space, and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX), Ways and  Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX), and fifteen other U.S. representatives signed a letter on Friday asking President Obama to ""Immediately raise the travel warnings to Level 3"" for the nations of Brazil, Columbia, Venezuela, Martinique, Honduras, and other countries where the Zika virus is a threat. The letter follows a hearing in May held by the Science, Space, and Technology Committee chaired by Representative Smith.During the May 25 hearing, shown in the video below, witnesses stated that all cases of people in the United States who have tested positive for the Zika virus are travel-related. The witnesses also explained that stricter travel advisories should be implemented and that all non-essential travel to these areas should be avoided.""Despite these concerns, and the fact that there still remains much about the Zika virus that deserves study, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has issued only Level Two travel alerts, which advise travelers only to 'practice enhanced precautions,'"" the representatives wrote in the letter attached below. ""It has not issued any Level Three warnings to 'avoid nonessential travel,' as it did with the Ebola virus in West Africa.""The letter also stated, ""If Americans continue to believe it is safe to travel to countries where the Zika virus is rampant, more will return home with infections. This increases the risks for all of us, whether we travel abroad or not, because if a mosquito bites a person who has carried Zika into the U.S., that mosquito can infect every other person it bites.""The congressional leaders wrote other precautions are already being taken in the U.S. because of the Zika threat. As an example, the representatives wrote that couples who are seeking fertility treatments are required to wait two to six months after returning from a country on the Center for Disease Control's Zika list. The American Red Cross has also implemented restrictions on blood donations from people who have been traveling to those countries. This step was taken in accordance with Food and Drug Administration.They also stated the travel restrictions are necessary because the ""potential impact of the Zika virus on Americans' health and welfare could be profound.""Following the committee's hearing in May, 150 prominent members of the science, academia, and public health community sent a letter to the director of the World Health Organization expressing apprehension about the global health implications from travel to countries like Brazil. That letter stated the ""Brazilian strain of Zika virus harms health in ways that science has not observed before.""The Congressional letter closes, stating, ""Given the risks associated with the Zika virus, we request that you immediately raise the travel warnings to Level 3 for Brazil, Columbia, Venezuela, Martinique, and Honduras, and other countries as appropriate.""In addition to the two chairmen from Texas, the letter was also signed by Representatives Frank D Lucas (R-OK), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), Jeff Miller (R-FL), Dr. Michael Burgess (R-TX), Randy Neugebauer (R-TX), Randy Hultgren (R-IL), Bill Posey (R-FL), Randy Weber (R-TX), Scott Tipton (R-CO), John Moolenaar (R-MI), Steve Knight (R-CA), Brian Babin (R-TX), Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), Ralph Lee Abraham (R-LA), and Roger Williams, (R-TX).Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on the impact of the Zika virus in the Lone Star State. Merrill Hope reported last week that ten women had tested positive for Zika in the Dallas area alone. Because of the threat of mosquitoes picking up the virus from an infected human and then spreading it to others, Microsoft chose Houston as a test project for a new high-technology mosquito trap designed to capture and study only those insects known to carry the virus.Bob Price serves as senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

"Hepatitis C and Zika virus have something in common: both belong to the virus family Flaviviridae. (Zika belongs to the genus Flavivirus; hepatitis C belongs to the genus hepacivirus). Yellow fever virus is also a member of the Flaviviridae family and yellow is the link here. Flavus means yellow in Latin, and Yellow fever was named because of its tendency to cause jaundice in people. New hepatitis C antiviral drugs may unlock the door to treatment for Zika.But I want to talk about something green -- money. Recently, President Obama requested 1.9 billion dollars to fight Zika virus. The US House approved 622 million dollars; the Senate approved 1.1 billion dollars. Compare this to funding for viral hepatitis (hep B and C). In fiscal year (FY) 2015, the CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis received 31.3 million dollars from Congress. That number was increased to 34 million dollars in FY2016. This year, the President requested 39 million dollars for FY2017. Hepatitis C advocates lobbied for 62.8 million dollars. However, this falls short of 170.3 million dollars that would cover the bare needs.Granted, the two viruses aren't the same, so let's look at the numbers, keeping in mind that numbers are people with the tears wiped away. On May 18, 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reported the following about Zika in the US:544 travel-associated cases reported0 locally acquired vector-borne cases reported10 sexually transmitted reports1 case of Guillain-Barré syndrome157 pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infectionIn US Territories4 travel-associated cases reported832 locally acquired cases reportedTotal: 8365 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome122 pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infectionHepatitis B and C Roughly 850,000 to as 2.2 million are infected with hepatitis B; 3.5 to 4.7 million are estimated to be living with hepatitis CNew hepatitis C infections increased 150% from 2010 to 2013; new hep B infections just saw its first rise in twenty yearsIn 2014, there were an estimated 19, 659 deaths from hepatitis C; 1843 people experienced hepatitis B-related deathsHepatitis C-related mortality in 2013 surpassed the total combined number of deaths from 60 other infectious diseases reported to CDC, including HIV, pneumococcal disease, and tuberculosis. Data from death certificates shows that hepatitis C is often underreported, so hepatitis C-related deaths are likely higher than these numbers suggest.If far more people are injured or killed by viral hepatitis, why is Zika getting more funding?If I were to guess why Zika virus is getting attention and money, my guess would be babies.  Take a look at the photos of the more than roughly 5,000 babies in Brazil with microcephaly and it is tragic. Consider the reports about other birth defects, such as vision problems, and it is heartbreaking. We can't turn our backs on Zika.But we also can't turn our backs on those with viral hepatitis. This is not a ""Zika"" versus ""viral hepatitis"" issue; this is a ""let's do the right thing for everyone"" issue. Writing in the Daily Signal, Senator James Lankford from Oklahoma wrote, ""The threat to adults from Zika is relatively small, but the threat to pre-born children is very high. Our national priority rightly focuses on protecting the life of these young children in the womb, since each child has value, no matter their age or size."" Senator Lankford almost got it right. However, I'd rewrite his last sentence, ""Each human has value, no matter their age or health problem.""","huffingtonpost","left","16958","zika",583
"Because of Paul Ryan and the Republican Party's anti-government, anti-science beliefs, too many American families will face microcephalic birth defects exactly  like those experienced by Japanese women after Hiroshima:After the dropping of atomic bombs ""Little Boy"" on Hiroshima and ""Fat Man"" on Nagasaki, several women close to ground zero who had been pregnant at the time gave birth to children with microcephaly.[22] Microcephaly prevalence was seven of a group of 11 pregnant women at 11-17 weeks of gestation who survived the blast at less than 1.2 km (0.75 mi) from ground zero. Due to their proximity to the bomb, the pregnant women's in utero children received a biologically significant radiation dose that was relatively high due to the massive neutron output of the lower explosive-yielding Little Boy.[23] Microcephaly is the only proven malformation, or congenital abnormality, found in the children of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[23]en.m.wikipedia.org/...Who gave Paul Ryan the right to allow this to happen to America's newborns? Republican voters did. Libertarians did.Paul Ryan's Republicans have already failed to confront the Zika outbreak in America. While they relax on another vacation and ignore desperate pleas by the head of the CDC for a quick scientifically-based reaction, more than 300 pregnant women in the US already have Zika. Microcephaly, an incurable condition, costs $10,000,000 per patient to treat. The mosquitos that carry Zika are especially bloodthirsty and resistant to insecticide.Zika induced Microcephaly will be Paul Ryan's legacy as the leader of his party.Some words from Obama's speech today in Japan concerning Hiroshima are especially prescient:Mere words cannot give voice to such suffering. But we have a shared responsibility to look directly into the eye of history and ask what we must do differently to curb such suffering again.If Americans care about newborn children, what we must do differently is to stop electing anti-government, anti-science Republicans, full stop.","dailykos","left","16948","zika",313
"  I'm about to make a rather monstrous accusation, couched as a prediction.  Republicans are slow-playing the response to the Zika virus to use it as a political football this fall.  ""What a terrible, horrible thing to say, jhop7! How could you?""  I'll tell you, it's all about history repeating itself, and the republican party of fear-mongering seeing a perfect opportunity to gin up mass hysteria they can turn against the democrats.  ""There are wolves in the woods!"" ""Willie Horton!"" ""WMD's!"" etc., etc.,   EBOLA!  I'd say the republicans do much better when they can pull a veil of paralyzing fear over the eyes of the media and electorate. Right now, they are deceptively ho-hum about the incredibly real dangers this virus poses. As much as there's a ton of coverage and worry on the threat, Congress keeps batting it back to the President, saying there are adequate resources for countering Zika ""left over"" from the Ebola crisis.  As democrats, we know this is all political maneuvering, and we tend to ascribe it to the nasty daily scrum that is Congress.  But think of what's about to happen  Summertime in the South. Cases of Zika already on our shores. Mosquitos that can transmit Zika breeding and feeding and reproducing  The election is a long 5 months away. Congress is clearly not going to fund an adequate response to the Zika virus. That is intentional, for some reason.  I'm positing they plan to reap electoral gains from the spread of the Zika virus on our shores.  Soon mosquitos will be transmitting the first cases by insect on the Gulf Coast. There will be cases in pregnant women. Fear, anger, questions will mount. Around August or September, the first cases of fetal microencephaly will be diagnosed, maybe in Louisiana or Texas. As the heat of summer moves the vectors north, cases will spread up to and across the Mason-Dixon line.  People will be blinded by emotions, as worry for their children, their friends, their unborn babies mounts. And there will be the republicans, arm in arm with Trump, demanding answers why, WHY didn't the President DO something about this sooner? We've known this was coming for over a YEAR! The President's plan was pitifully inadequate and didn't help all those poor, suffering mothers whose children will be born with this terrible condition and the Worry it causes to all expecting mothers! My God, this is far worse than Katrina ever was!!!!  We run the risk of taking the republican response to the threat of the Zika virus as just another case of run-of-the-mill foot-dragging. The Zika virus' impact could be huge, both to people's health and well-being, and to the election this fall.  A stand must be taken to demand an adequate response from Congress NOW.","dailykos","left","16949","zika",470
"Detroit Tigers closer Francisco Rodriguez confesses that he caught Zika in the offseason.""It wasn't a cold, trust me,"" Rodriguez told ESPN. ""It wasn't a cold.

"Mosquitoes capable of carrying the Zika virus continue to spread in California.On Wednesday, officials in Yolo County in Northern California announced that an individual who had traveled abroad had tested positive for the virus-the sixth person in the state to do so since 2013, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.Thus far, all of the cases in California involve people who had traveled to Latin America, where the virus is carried by mosquitoes.There are concerns that the virus could also spread along other vectors, including through sexual transmission and blood transfusions, and perhaps through other body fluids as well.Zika causes mild flu-like symptoms, and some of those infected may feel no symptoms at all. However, in pregnant women, it is associated with microcephaly-the birth of babies with small skulls, which causes brain damage and requires extensive surgeries and rehabilitation.The Aedes aegypti mosquito is an invasive species that spreads Zika, and bites during the day. In California, the species has already been found in Orange County and is spreading to other parts of the state, taking advantage of unusually wet conditions caused by the El Niño weather pattern, which has brought rain to much of the drought-stricken state.Officials in Santa Cruz County, for example, expect the mosquitos to spread to their region soon.None of the Aedes aegypti mosquitos in the state have been found to carry Zika, but officials expect that to change.""We think it's only a matter of time before the viruses and the mosquitoes in California get together, and that we have infected mosquitoes, and that there's local transmission. But this won't be a very frequent occurrence,"" said Paul Binding, Santa Cruz mosquito control director, in an interview with Central Coast-based NBC affiliate KSBW.Photo: file","breitbart","right","16842","zika",299
"NBC's ""Today"" anchor Savannah Guthrie announced she is pregnant and will stay behind for the network's coverage of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games due to the Zika virus outbreak.Guthrie surprised her co-anchors with the announcement she is pregnant with her second child on Tuesday.

"On Friday, scientists detected Zika virus in both urine and saliva for the first time, classifying the virus in the bodily fluid samples as ""active."" That means the fluid samples are capable of transmitting Zika. This finding, coupled with recent reports of a sexually transmitted Zika case in Texas, indicates that sexual contact may become a significant mode of transmission for the disease.The conclusion bodes poorly for the most impoverished women in Brazil and other Latin American countries, where access to comprehensive sex education and reproductive care -- including abortion -- is spotty to nonexistent.While Brazilian researchers cautioned that it was too soon to say whether the virus can be transmitted via urine or saliva, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention affirmed Friday that sexual contact was a mode of Zika virus transmission.""That fact that the virus was found with the capacity to cause infection is not proof that it can contaminate other people through those fluids,"" Myrna Bonaldo, one of the scientists at Brazil's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation who made the discovery, told Reuters. Dr. Paulo Gadelha, the president of Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, which is part of the country's health ministry, reminded Brazilians that Aedes aegypti mosquitos remain the primary vector for transmitting the virus, but that didn't stop him from warning pregnant women not to kiss strangers at the Carnival celebrations kicking off tonight, Reuters reported. ""In light of the possibility of being in contact with someone who is infected, do not kiss, obviously,"" Gadelha said. ""We cannot say today that there is no possibility of transmission.""The discovery comes days after the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department reported the first case of sexually transmitted Zika virus in the United States, after a patient contracted the virus from a sexual partner who had recently returned from Venezuela. On Thursday, Brazil reported the first Zika infection from a blood transfusion, and urged prospective donors to delay donations a full 30 days after recovering from a Zika infection.After the Dallas report, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its Zika virus public health recommendation. Until the agency knows more about how the virus can be spread, it's advising pregnant women to avoid traveling to the 30 countries and territories with active Zika transmissions.If a pregnant woman's male sexual partner lives in or travels to an area with active Zika transmissions, the agency recommends using condoms for vaginal, anal and oral sex during her pregnancy. Women trying to conceive should consult their health care providers before traveling to any areas with ongoing Zika transmissions and should adhere to the strictest standards of mosquito bite prevention.""The potential hazard to the fetus is so substantial and so tragic that this looks like a very prudent recommendation until we learn more,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical School, told The New York Times.Still, the implications of sexually transmitted Zika are quite serious for a population that struggles with teen pregnancy and a dearth of sex education.According to a 2014 government health report, teenage pregnancy rates are driven by high figures in Brazil's northeast region -- the same area that's been hardest hit by Zika virus. Of those teenage mothers, about 1 percent -- or 30,000 girls -- are between the ages of 10 and 15.Sex education in Brazil is disjointed and controversial, according to Al Jazeera America, unsurprising in a heavily Catholic country with strict abortion law. Under such circumstances, women with fewer resources for disease prevention, care and treatment will be disproportionally affected by Zika (and, should the link between the two be proven, microcephaly), according to Brandon Brown, an assistant professor at University of California, Riverside's Center for Healthy Communities.""If the United States is anything like the rest of the world, what we see is that high-income couples delay childbirth or adoption until an older age, compared to their lower-income counterparts,"" Brown said.""This results in fewer children for high-income women. Low-income women may have fewer resources to prevent pregnancy compared to women with a higher income,"" he said. ""Therefore, even for those intending to follow the mandate to not get pregnant, they may be unable to do so due to lack of resources.""That's true for Hilda Venancio Silva, whose three-month-old son was born with microcephaly. Silva, 38, had to seek out information about birth control on her own. ""To be honest, I never had any education about it,"" Venancio told Al Jazeera America.""It is true that many infectious diseases do have a higher impact on low-income individuals and in low-income settings,"" Brown said. ""HIV and TB are good examples of this. Not only does a high disease burden fall on low-income individuals, but it also historically falls on lower-income countries.""","huffingtonpost","left","16836","zika",951
"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that $56 million were needed to combat the Zika virus until June, including for the fast-tracking of vaccines, diagnostics and research studies into how it spreads.The funds, including $25 million for the WHO and its regional office, would also be used to control the mosquito-borne virus that has spread to 39 countries, including 34 in the Americas, and has been linked to birth defects in Brazil.""Possible links with neurological complications and birth malformations have rapidly changed the risk profile for Zika from a mild threat to one of very serious proportions,"" WHO director-general Margaret Chan said in the WHO Strategic Response Framework and Joint Operations Plan issued in Geneva.The WHO expects the funds to come from member states and other donors and said that in the meantime it has tapped a new emergency contingency fund for $2 million to finance its initial operations.Chan will travel to Brazil from Feb 22-24 to review Zika-related measures supported by WHO and will meet the health minister, a WHO spokeswoman said.The United Nations health agency declared the Zika outbreak a global public health emergency on Feb 1, noting its association with two neurological disorders, microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barre syndrome that can cause paralysis.Brazil is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4,300 suspected cases of microcephaly, a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems.Researchers have confirmed more than 460 of these cases as microcephaly and identified evidence of Zika infection in 41 of these cases, but have not proven that Zika can cause microcephaly.The WHO noted that ""existing scarce evidence indicates that there may be a risk of sexual transmission"" of Zika virus, as well as a risk of it persisting in semen and urine.""There is currently very little evidence of mother-to-child transmission; however, intra-uterine infections seem to be associated with subsequent neurological conditions in the child.""Research studies are needed to assess the presence of the Zika virus in semen and other body fluids, including pregnancy-related fluids, and potential sexual transmission, and mother-to-child transmission, the WHO said.","huffingtonpost","left","16848","zika",391

"The threat the Zika virus poses to Americans is more serious than the federal government claims, according to at least one mosquito expert.""First of all, I think Zika will come to America, and actually I think it may be more important than the messaging we're getting out of Washington and [The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention],"" Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, told Fox News.In an article exclusively written for CNN, Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), assessed Zika's threat to the United States.Dr. Frieden noted that travelers returning to the United States from Zika-afflicted places have been infected by the virus, including a woman in Hawaii who delivered a baby with microcephaly, a neurological disorder that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and developmental problems.Microcephaly and Guillain-Barré, a rare syndrome that causes the immune system to damage nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis, have been linked to Zika virus infections.The woman in Hawaii delivered the baby with the neurological disorder after she contracted the virus in Brazil, the country most afflicted by Zika.""We will certainly see more travelers returning to the United States with Zika after being infected in parts of the world where the virus is spreading,"" wrote Frieden. ""But the big question many people have is whether Zika will spread widely within the United States.""""So we do expect, unfortunately, that Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands could have many infections with the Zika virus, and we will certainly see U.S. travelers returning with Zika infections, just as we saw travelers returning with dengue and chikungunya infections,"" he added. ""We could see isolated cases and small clusters of infections in other parts of the country where the mosquito is present. But from the information we know now, widespread transmission in the contiguous United States appears to be unlikely.""The CDC has advised pregnant women against traveling to 30 countries and territories in the Americas, Oceania, and Africa, but it has said more evidence is needed to confirm the relationship between the virus and microcephaly.Dr. Hotez from the Baylor College of Medicine noted that the Zika-carrying mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, can be found in Texas and other Gulf Coast states, adding that the insect is likely to start multiplying in March when the region warms up.The mosquito expert indicated that the federal government is downplaying Zika's threat to the United States.""Hotez thinks Washington's take on the current Zika virus outbreak in Latin America may be a matter of nuance, but that he takes issue with the implication of the term 'small outbreak,' which the federal government has said the U.S. could see some of among Gulf Coast states,"" reports Fox News.""Zika has the ability to cause birth defects,"" explained Hotez. ""By saying 'small outbreaks' are going to affect Florida and Texas, are we saying we can tolerate small outbreaks of microcephaly in these states? I would say, 'No, we don't have any tolerance.'""Conditions in many of the lower-income areas in the South mirror those of the countries and territories that are currently seeing a Zika outbreak, including Brazil, according to the Baylor dean.The Zika-carrying mosquitoes are likely to ""breed in pools of water that accumulate in discarded car tires, flower pots, and filled drinking cups left outdoors,"" notes Fox News.""I believe all of the conditions where they're present in Latin America and the Caribbean are also present in Texas and other Gulf Coast states,"" said Hotez.""Which means we have time [to prepare] - and now's the time to do it,"" he added.However, Dr. Hotez and Joe Conlon, a technical adviser at the American Mosquito Control Association, believe that combating Zika may be tougher in the United Sates than in Latin America.""Controlling the main mosquito that carries Zika may prove more challenging in the U.S. than in Latin America, where governments are going into homes and spraying walls with pesticide, Hotez and Conlon said,"" reports Fox News ""Unlike other common mosquitoes in the U.S., they like to feed on humans during the day, which means people who live in homes without window screens would have a high infection risk,"" Hotez said.Moreover, Conlon noted that the Aedes aegypti mosquito will not respond to the standard mosquito control practices employed in the United States.The threat against Americans posed by Zika has driven some advocacy groups to push for tighter health screenings among travelers and immigrants from Zika-afflicted countries, Fox News reports.","breitbart","right","16836","zika",786
"A mother cradles the head her daughter who was recently born with Microcephaly in the Brazilian city of Recife (Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters)My fellow Americans, there is a new disease among us. It has only recently begun to make its way to our country from Latin America, but it will surely spread farther. Discovered in Sub-Saharan Africa shortly after World War II, this mosquito-borne alphavirus lay low for decades, popping up sporadically until the last few years, when it exploded on the international scene, ravaging not just Africa, but Asia and the more tropical portions of the Americas. Carried aloft in the bloodstreams of unsuspecting travelers, this virus has finally made landfall in the United States, with 44 states having reported cases. In adults who contract the virus, the predominant symptoms are fever, joint pain and rashes, although pregnant women are at greatest risk, as they can pass it on to their babies, potentially causing neonatal encephalopathy and leading to diminished neurological functioning. There is no known cure and no effective treatment has been developed. It seems like nothing can stop Chikungunya from wreaking havoc throughout the US.If you were expecting to see the Zika virus name-dropped at the end of that paragraph, I certainly can't fault you. In recent weeks, certain corners of the media have begun whipping the American public into a panic over Zika, a tropical disease that has been relatively active in recent years in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. In 2014, likely because of the major influx of tourists for The World Cup, the Zika virus was transferred to Brazil, where it has turned into a health crisis and spread to other portions of South and Central America.Health workers fumigate a cemetery in Lima, Peru to prevent the spread of Dengue, Chikunguya and Zika viruses (AP Photo/Martin Mejia)Over the past year, prevalence of Zika throughout Latin and South America has sky rocketed, leading Brazil to declare a national health emergency and for El Salvador, Ecuador and Columbia to release official government statements asking citizens to not have children for varying lengths of time due to the disease's possible negative impact on neonatal health. For its part, the Centers for Disease Control have recently recommended that that women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant avoid traveling to countries that have ongoing transmission of the virus. The impetus of the unprecedented severity of this particular Zika outbreak is thought to lie in climate change, specifically in the increased rains brought on by this year's particularly strong El Nino, which has provided more breeding grounds for Zika carrying mosquitos in these tropical nations.With that being said, none of the information provided above really explains why the Zika virus has received such a wealth of media exposure, while other mosquito-borne viruses get comparatively short shrift. As a member of the Flavivirus family, Zika bears a great resemblance to many of its virological brethren, sharing traits with viruses like Chikungunya, West Nile, Dengue and Yellow Fever. In fact, these viruses are so analogous that it's currently impossible to know just how prevalent Zika is because the only tests we have for it have a very small window of efficacy during the virus's infectious phase and because the virus is so similar to Dengue and Yellow Fever that past exposure or vaccination to these viruses make Zika testing a crap shoot. Based on the level of alarm that's being raised in the US media, it would be reasonable to assume that Zika is virus on par with Ebola, but Zika has historically been considered one of the tamer Flaviviruses and is still being described by many as ""Dengue Light"".As the western world goes into a collective conniption fit over Zika, Dengue Fever has quietly infected 1.6 Brazilians in the past year, killing 863 people. Dengue, which is transmitted by the same Aedes aegypti mosquitos that transmit Zika, is also a virus that has grown at a disturbing rate, undergoing a 30-fold increase in incidence over the last 50 years with 390 million infections occurring annually. With this being the case-and with a slew of infectious diseases like Tuberculous, HIV/AIDS and Malaria that kill millions each year-why has the Zika virus ignited a media firestorm? After all, Chikungunya cases were reported in the vast majority of US states last year, West Nile has been constant presence in America throughout the 21st Century and Hawaii is currently dealing with an outbreak of Dengue Fever so big thatRepresentative Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) is urging the state's governor to declare a state of emergency. Why isn't Dengue Fever plastered across the front pages of newspapers and homepages throughout America?The distribution of cases of microcephaly in Central and South America since 2010To answer those questions, we have to look at the sorts of stories that capture our attention and the types of diseases that frighten us. Up until very recently, there was nothing about Zika that made it terribly exciting or newsworthy. It was an obscure virus that elicited a variety of hum-drum symptoms (mild fever, rash, joint pain, pink eye) and was confined to portions of the globe that American media largely doesn't cover and the average American rarely thinks about. Had the Zika remained in Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania it would still be a non-story in this country. However, when the virus entered into Central & South America, everything changed.One would think that the major cause for the sudden interest in Zika by the American public would be the virus's closer proximity to the United States, but that is only half the story. After all, there's an outbreak of Dengue Fever going on in a US state as I write this and it's not grabbing headlines, while Zika-a less severe disease that has yet to make significant landfall in America-is. The reason for this, I propose, lies predominantly in the ways we perceive and internalize the harm and risk surrounding microcephaly, a birth defect that has been associated, but not linked, to the spread of Zika in Latin America.Since the Zika virus began to spread throughout Brazil in earnest last spring, physicians and nurses began noticing an abnormally large number of newborns with a condition known as microcephaly, wherein an infant is born with a significantly underdeveloped brain and skull. Brazil has seen 4,000 babies born with this irreversible condition in the past year-a twenty-fold increase over the usual rate-at the same time the Zika epidemic has broken out. No causal link has been established yet between Zika and microcephaly, with the virus's genetic material being found in only 6 of the 4,000 cases of infants born with the birth defect, but it is strongly suspected that the link is there.The substantial increase in babies being born with microcephaly in Latin America is certainly tragic, but I would argue that our collective response to Zika in America is based more on the macabre and horrifying nature of the way the virus is manifesting itself than the actual danger it poses to us. Dengue Fever, which is prevalent wherever Zika is, already kills roughly 25,000 people each year, has been shown to lead to miscarriage, fetal death and maternal death, and is currently running roughshod through Hawaii, hasn't made much of a splash in American media while Zika has because it occupies the realms of the known and the mundane.If we as a nation really cared about infectious disease and the totality of the unacceptably large portion of humanity that is still ravaged by it, we'd be freaking out in even greater measure about the growing Tuberculosis pandemic that caused 1.5 million people to die TB-related deaths in 2014 as multi-drug resistant strains of the virus become more and more prevalent. If the average American was worried about the state of infectious disease in their country and the world, we wouldn't have a news media that largely ignores the 50,000 Americans who contract HIV each year and that never mentions the over half a million people who die from Malaria each year.The argument could be made that the Zika virus has generated such headlines because it seems to have had its effect primarily on newborns and young children, but that hardly makes it novel. Malaria, Pneumonia and Infectious Diarrhea all have their most damaging effect on children under 5, with anestimated annual death toll between the 3 of them of roughly 2.5 million kids, the vast majority of whom live in Sub-Saharan Africa. We aren't fascinated with the Zika virus here in America because of the small, yet legitimate threat it poses to pregnant women and their newborns who travel to Central and South America. We are fascinated because it would appear that Zika silently sabotages the miracle of birth, turning a moment of unparalleled joy into a nightmare and delivering in the place of a healthy baby boy or girl, a wailing, underdeveloped infant that will likely never know a normal life.<U+200B>The distribution of cases of microcephaly in Central and South America since 2010The term microcephaly may not have registered in most American households prior to the appearance of the Zika virus, but show those same households a photo or a video of an adult suffering from microcephaly and odds are that their first association would be the same: the circus. Ever since the advent of the circus sideshow in the mid 19th-century, microcephalics-or ""pinheads"" as they were known at the time-were frequently featured. From the introduction of ""Zip the Pinhead"", played by a black microcephalic from New Jersey named William Henry Johnson, into P.T. Barnum's circus in the 1860s, to the use of Schlitzie in the cult 1930's film Freaks and the microcephalic character Pepper in American Horror Story (played by an actress without microcephaly), the neurological condition has always been rooted in freak show culture.While it is an unequivocally good thing that WHO, the international community and the US media are taking note of the outbreak of Zika virus in Central and South America and taking what appears to be swifter action against it that it did with Ebola in 2014, I feel that it's still important to take a long hard look at why this particular virus has so captured our attention when similar viruses that are arguably more severe and pose bigger threats to public health in America have not. If we truly ask ourselves what it is about the Zika virus that so scares and intrigues us, we cannot help but notice that we are drawn to it more by the bizarre, aberrant way in which the virus seems to be effecting those who contract it than by any empirically validated threat. Much like the man who's terrified of losing his life in a plane crash, but winds up dying while texting on the freeway, we cannot allow the fear of Zika to occupy too much space in our minds while there are other, more deadly infectious diseases already flourishing both in United States and abroad.","dailykos","left","16831","zika",1850

"Zika virus probably arrived in Brazil in mid-2013, researchers said Thursday in a study that says the World Cup soccer tournament and other stand-alone events probably aren't to blame for the outbreak that's been linked to serious birth defects in Latin America.Researchers said genome sequencing shows the mosquito-borne virus likely landed between May and December 2013, meaning it preceded the soccer event that brought visitors from around the globe to the Amazon, Rio de Janeiro and other cities in 2014, and it hit before a championship canoe race later that year, according to an article in the journal Science.Rather, researchers said it is more useful to look at broader travel patterns. For instance, air travel from Zika-affected areas to Brazil spiked by 50 percent in 2013.The rapid spread of Zika virus in Latin America has been tied to a sharp uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, or microcephaly, and Guillian-Barre syndrome, which can lead to paralysis.Scientists have also concluded that it can be transmitted sexually.""In less than a year, the status of Zika has changed from a mild medical curiosity to a disease with severe public health implications,"" World Health Organization Director-General Margaret Chan said this week.Zika is a little-known virus that festered for decades in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region before globe-hopping to Latin America, where it has spread to more than 20 countries.The Science article says the Tahitian national soccer team did travel to Brazil for the Confederations Cup - a sort of tuneup tournament for nations that host the World Cup the following year - in June 2013, yet its visit predated reported Zika cases in Tahiti by several months.Though Zika isn't transmitting locally within the U.S., scientists said that could change once temperatures climb.As of Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recorded 273 cases among travelers who returned to the states from Zika-affected countries.Puerto Rico has reported 317 cases of locally acquired Zika, putting it at the vanguard of the U.S. epidemic because its warm climes are hospitable to the type of mosquito that serves as the virus's primary vector.The Aedes aegypti mosquito also is found in several southern states, and the more-prevalent Aedes albopictus mosquito also is capable of carrying the virus.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused her Republican rivals Thursday of wasting time on their ""dead-end special interest"" agenda instead of freeing up billions of federal dollars to address the Zika threat and other emergencies.""Unless Congress approves emergency resources soon, the man-made disaster of the Flint water crisis, the accelerating tragedy of opioid addiction, and the growing danger the Zika virus poses to expectant mothers will do irreversible damage to thousands of Americans,"" Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, said in a letter to her Democratic troops.Congressional Republicans say the White House should spend money left over from the Ebola fight before it seeks a massive influx of new money for the Zika fight.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan affirmed that position earlier this week, as he grapples with a faction of conservatives who've balked at spending levels contained in a GOP-authored budget for fiscal 2017.For its part, the administration isn't budging either, saying it is committed to fighting the emerging Zika virus and flare-ups of Ebola in West Africa, even if the primary outbreak that killed over 11,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea is over.""As we have said, while we may be able to repurpose some existing Ebola funding without undermining our ongoing fight against the disease, that alone would not provide a sufficient enough response to the significant threat posed by Zika, which is why Congress should take action on the Administration's emergency request for Zika funding,"" the White House's Office of Management and Budget said in a statement to The Washington Times. ","washingtontimes","right","16884","zika",651
"""Zika Does Not Justify Abortion or Contraception"" declared the National Catholic Bioethics Center.  Three powerful cardinals - from New York, Washington DC and Boston - plus five archbishops - including those of Los Angeles and Philadelphia - are among the board of directors.""Republicans' fears about the use of taxpayer money for abortion and possible increased use of contraception"" are ""lurking beneath the surface"" of their opposition to legislation to fight the Zika virus.Because the virus can cause severe birth defects in babies of infected mothers, Republicans have had concerns that taxpayer funds might somehow be used to help provide abortions.As a precaution, Senate Republicans insisted on writing language into their measure on Zika financing that reiterated the Hyde Amendment - a provision named for the longtime Illinois congressman Henry Hyde that bans the use of government money for abortionsThere has also been debate about whether the government should stress contraception or abstinence in public education campaigns about how the Zika virus can be transmitted even more readily by sexual intercourse than by mosquitoes.The Senate measure includes money for community health programs that might stress the effectiveness and importance of contraception.By making contraception their bludgeon against Obamacare and the foundation of their ""religious freedom"" campaigns, the US bishops have boxed themselves into a corner. ""Even though the Zika virus can be transmitted even more readily by sexual intercourse than by mosquitoes,"" the bishops have no choice but to use their considerable political muscle to make sure no government funding provides for any program ""stressing the effectiveness and importance of contraception.""The administration and Democrats in Congress know that, at enormous taxpayer expense, as of October 2015 over 100 lawsuits had been filed in federal courts challenging the Affordable Care Act's birth control benefit. The vast majority were brought by Catholic bishops and their affiliated institutions.Time is of the essence in addressing Zika. ""This is no way to fight an epidemic,"" Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in regards to Congressional failure to approve federal funds. ""Three months is an eternity for control of an outbreak,"" he said, adding: ""There is a narrow window of opportunity here and it's closing. Every day that passes makes it harder to stop Zika.""So in the face of an epidemic, government funding may have to be restricted to eradicating mosquitoes in order to avoid lengthy legal battles brought by the bishops and their proxies.USCCB launched their election year campaign with a fright video against birth control.In early May, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) released a nine minute video implying that our government will first become a police state and then brutally totalitarian unless their ""religious freedom"" to deny coverage for contraception prevails.The first few minutes are devoted to extolling the care provided by the Little Sisters of the Poor who, we are told, ""are being harassed by the United States government"" for adhering to the ""precepts of their faith."" The bishops don't mention the nuns were only asked to file a simple form requesting the exemption offered by the Obama administration to religiously-affiliated organizations so they could deny their employees the contraception coverage provided under the Affordable Care Act.Skip to footage of Hillary Clinton with the narrative, ""the government stopping us from practicing our faith."" Followed by disturbing scenes of storm-trooper-like militias battling protesters and marching down the street while a speaker intones ""religious freedom is under siege.""The video resorts to horrifying images of victims of ISIS brutality, at least five of ISIS prisoners being led to their executions and then triumphant ISIS soldiers. Voice-overs by clerics and academics imply this will be the similar martyrdom of American Christians at the hands of our government unless we stand with them for ""religious freedom"" against contraception.The bishops followed their video with the ""bi-partisan"" National Catholic Prayer Breakfast on May 17 in Washington DC. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and the ""communications director"" for the Little Sisters of the Poor, who can now afford such a position, were special guests. Justice Antonin Scalia's son led a prayer favored by conservative Catholics.The keynote speaker was Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah, appointed by Pope Francis as prefect of the Vatican Congregation for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments in 2014. ""In your nation, God is being eroded, eclipsed, liquidated,"" Sarah told the attendees.Sarah condemned same-sex marriage, contraception and transgender bathroom laws as ""demonic idolatry."" ""All manner of immorality is not only accepted and tolerated today in advanced societies, it is even promoted as a social good,"" the cardinal declared. ""The result is hostility to Christians and increasingly, religious persecution.""The cardinal warned, ""The violence against Christians is not just physical, it is also political, ideological and cultural. This form of religious persecution is equally damaging, yet more hidden. This is the will of the Evil One.""  ""Do we not see signs of this insidious war in this great nation of the United States?"" Sarah asked.""This is why the Holy Father openly and vigorously defends Church teaching on contraception, abortion, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, the education of children, and much more,"" Sarah added.National and International UnityUnlike evangelical pastors, the 454 American bishops speak in national unity through the USCCB and, through the pope, unity with the global Church providing both political muscle and access to domestic and international dark money.By June 2015, about $3.5 billion was spent on sex abuse settlement-related costs by US Church officials according to the USCCB. Yet, the bishops still have available ""millions to fight clergy sex abuse accountability. Lobbying funds have gone towards opposing bills that would extend statutes of limitations for child sex abuse cases"" for all Americans.After the Supreme Court sent their lawsuit, Bishop David Zubik v Burwell,  back to the lower courts on May 16, Washington DC Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl said ""this struggle will continue,""  meaning the bishops' seemingly unlimited funding is still available to continue fighting against contraception.Unity with the pope on contraceptionWhen asked about the Zika virus during an in-flight interview, Pope Francis said: ""On avoiding pregnancy, we are speaking in terms of the conflict between the fifth and sixth commandment. Paul VI, a great man, in a difficult situation in Africa, permitted nuns to use contraceptives in cases of rape. [A]voiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil. In certain cases, as in this one, or in the one I mentioned of Blessed Paul VI, it was clear. I would also urge doctors to do their utmost to find vaccines against these two mosquitoes that carry this disease. This needs to be worked on.""Knowing that ""avoiding pregnancy"" is not a ""conflict"" between ""You shall not kill"" and ""You shall not commit adultery,"" that Paul VI did no such thing, and that the Church has always approved of ""avoiding pregnancy"" by abstinence or Natural Family Planning, the US episcopate and Cardinal Sarah are confident in disregarding the pontiff when he says what others want to hear. Except for this occasion, Pope Francis has always been firmly opposed to birth control.In 2014, Pope Francis beatified Pope Paul VI, infamous for issuing the encyclical ""Humanae Vitae"" which reaffirmed the Church's prohibition of contraception.  In an interview with an Italian newspaper, Pope Francis praised his predecessor. Paul VI was ""prophetic, he had the courage to take a stand against the majority, to defend moral discipline, to exercise a cultural restraint, to oppose present and future neo-Malthusianism,"" he said.During his trip to the Philippines in 2015, ""Pope Francis reaffirmed the Church's ban on contraception, leading us to conclude that abstinence is his answer to rampant population growth and its consequential poverty and environmental destruction.""Pope Francis ""reaffirms the Church's virtually absolute condemnation of contraception"" in his April 2016 exhortation, ""Amoris Lætitia.""Pope Francis' understanding of women is part of the same ideology that led to the creation of Draconian anti-abortion laws in El Salvador as well as countless Catholic-sponsored movements to keep contraceptives out of the hands of women, particularly poor women, whose need to manage the size of their families is a matter of life and death.Unity with the pope on hyperbole""Argentina is being harmed by demagoguery, totalitarianism, corruption and efforts to secure unlimited power,"" Cardinal Bergoglio stated the year before he became pope when the administration ""pushed for mandatory sex education in schools, free distribution of contraceptives in public hospitals, and the right for transsexuals to change their official identities on demand.""Earlier, Bergoglio called same-sex marriage an ""anthropological regression,"" a phrase he repeated as pope in 2014.In 2015, the pope compared transgender people to nuclear weapons.[Pope Francis] calls the dominant ""uniform thought,"" atheist and ""libertine,"" the ""new opium of the people."" His vision of the world is apocalyptic, of a cosmic battle with the devil as the great adversary. He speaks of it often, especially in his morning homilies. He is not silent about his aversion to the advent of new self-proclaimed families without ""the masculinity and femininity of a father and a mother."" He is inflexible in calling abortion an ""abominable crime.""Unity with the pope on ""religious freedom""When Pres. Obama met in private with the pope in March 2014, the Vatican statement said the pontiff ""pressed Obama 'on questions of particular relevance for the Church, such as the exercise of the rights to religious freedom, life and conscientious objection' - all coded language for the fallout from [the Affordable Care Act contraception] mandates  In that light, it's difficult to imagine it won't come up in some fashion when Francis and Obama have their tête-à-tête in Washington.""Vatican reporter John L. Allen Jr., author of the above quote was correct. At the White House last September, Pope Francis said: ""[Religious] freedom remains one of America's most precious possessions. And, as my brothers, the United States Bishops, have reminded us, all are called to be vigilant, precisely as good citizens, to preserve and defend that freedom from everything that would threaten or compromise it.""Christians are persecuted ""for wanting to have and to manifest the values of a Son of God,"" the pope stated on April 12. ""We see every day that the powerful countries create laws that force us to go through this path  It's a persecution that robs man of his freedom, even from conscientious objection!"" he added. These persecutions have ""a boss,"" the pope said, meaning Satan.  Pope Francis ""has used similar vocabulary to object to what he calls an 'ideological colonization' of developing countries by Western nations  on matters such as contraception, abortion and gay marriage.""Betty Clermont is author of The Neo-Catholics: Implementing Christian Nationalism in America.","dailykos","left","16952","zika",1789
"A friend of mine, an intelligent highly regarded science journalist, recently decided to cancel a vacation to Puerto Rico with his wife and kids. Because of concern about Zika virus.Another friend, an expert in ecology and one of the most highly regarded professors at Harvard, just canceled a talk he was scheduled to give at a conference in Sao Paolo Brazil this summer. Because of fear of Zika virus.These decisions are worth reflection for a couple reasons. First, they were made by smart people...scientifically smart people. Second, the World Health Organization and CDC are pretty clear that Zika freaks them out because of the link between the virus and microcephaly, children born with shrunken brains or skulls if their moms had Zika while they were pregnant. This was not a risk my friends had to worry about. So why their Zika freakout? My science journalist friend noted that Zika has also been associated with neurotrophic diseases (of the brain and nervous tissue) including Guillain Barre disease, an inflammation of the brain that in rare cases arises after infections. But Guillain Barre arises, rarely, after all sorts of infections, including dengue fever, which has been widespread in Puerto Rico since 1963. That hadn't stopped them from planning a vacation to Puerto Rico. So why Zika?My other friend, the Harvard professor, said he was worried because ""scientists still don't know...there is a lot of uncertainty..."" ""But what about all the cases of dengue and chikungunya virus in Sao Paolo?"" I asked. ""They didn't scare you off. And what about all the evidence about Zika from how it has affected people around the world for decades,"" I added. ""Most people bitten by an infected mosquito don't show any symptoms, and among the small percentage of people who do, you get usually mild flu-like symptoms - aches and fever and sluggishness - for a few days up to a week...and that's it. The only thing scientists aren't sure about is the link to what it does to the fetus. And you aren't a fetus.""My friend, who knows I teach risk perception at Harvard, smiled and sheepishly acknowledged ""Maybe I sound irrational, I know. But it just feels scary, all that uncertainty, so I decided to err on the safe side.""Neither of my friends erred, of course. Their decisions weren't right or wrong, smart or dumb, rational or irrational. They were the right decisions for them, because to them those choices felt right, felt safe, despite what the bulk of the evidence may say. But their choices do teach an important lesson. Decisions about risk and how to keep ourselves safe aren't about the evidence alone, even for intelligent scientifically literate people. Risk perception is much more about how we feel than what the facts alone may say. Uncertainty makes risks feel scarier. So does lots of attention, like Zika's been getting.Choices about risk based on emotion as much as cold hard reason are not automatically wrong/dumb/irrational. In fact, they usually help protect us. What's the harm in being careful? Like they say, better safe than sorry. But there can be real danger in these choices too. They sometimes produce a Risk Perception Gap...when we worry too much, or not enough, and do things that feel safe, but aren't. My science journalist friend and family only missed a vacation, and my professor friend missed a speaking opportunity (and maybe an honorarium check). But what about people who are too afraid of, say, human-made vaccines, so they don't inoculate their kids? Or people who are too afraid of flying, so they drive...a riskier way to travel? What about people who aren't afraid enough of texting while they drive, or not afraid enough of obesity to diet and exercise, or not afraid enough of the sun to wear sun screen or a hat, or not afraid enough of climate change to press our leaders to act? Those choices all feel right too...but they expose the people making them to real danger.Examples of the Risk Perception Gap and its dangers are everywhere. So my friends' choices offer a gentle warning. We need to work to get more information - from credible sources - before making a choice about a risk, and we need to work hard to give that information a fair voice as our brain figures out what choice to make. Emotions and instincts will still speak loudly as we make our decisions, but keeping our feelings from dominating the decision might lead to a choice that actually keeps us safer. And after all, that's the goal.","huffingtonpost","left","16903","zika",798
"Brazil's Health Minister, Ricardo Barros, told the nation's Senate that he believes there is ""practically zero"" chance of an outbreak of Zika virus during next month's Summer Olympics.Brazilian officials are increasingly referring to the Zika threat as it wanes, while international concern grows over Rio de Janeiro's soaring crime rate, lack of funding for hospitals or police, and pollution that has already begun to sicken athletes.Speaking to the Senate on Wednesday, Barros compared the rates of infection of dengue in 2014, when the nation hosted the FIFA World Cup, to Zika infections he estimated would occur during the Olympics. In 2014, Brazil hosted one million tourists and documented three cases of dengue, which is spread through the same species of mosquito as Zika, aedes aegypti.""Historical data proves that, during the winter, the incidents of transmission of the virus are extremely low,"" he said, noting that Brazil is currently experiencing the Southern Hemisphere's winter. He cited both the low temperatures and ""a tremendous effort"" on the part of Rio de Janeiro authorities to drain stagnant water and prevent mosquito nests from growing for the drop in cases.""Whoever wants to go to the Olympics can go because there is no risk of viral infection, or the risk is practically zero,"" he concluded.Bringing even more attention to the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America, of which Brazil is the epicenter, the government recently named Off! brand the official mosquito repellant of the Olympic Games, a corporate first.The Zika virus outbreak has already caused a number of athletes, including golfers Rory McIlroy and Jason Day, to state they are not participating in the Olympics this year. On the other side of the spectrum, Jamaican runner Kemar Bailey-Cole has said he will compete in the Olympics despite already carrying the Zika virus.The Zika virus does not cause symptoms in an estimated 80 percent of patients. In those who do suffer from the infection, patients experience muscle weakness and pain, fatigue, and conjunctivitis. The virus is a major threat, however, to pregnant women and those who may become pregnant, as it causes severe neurological damage in unborn children.The fact that Zika is a much bigger threat to women has led some to accuse the officials responsible for the Olympics of sexism in downplaying the threat. ""Zika is only really dangerous if you're a woman of childbearing age. And that only affects about half of the Olympians and spectators. And that half is just women anyway,"" writes Jane McManus at ESPN in a tongue-in-cheek article jokingly urging the world to dismiss the threat.The resurgence of Zika as a topic of conversation among Brazilian and Olympic officials follows a refocusing of concerns regarding the Rio de Janeiro Games. The city is currently facing a major fiscal crisis that has halted police vehicles and left hospitals with a lack of basic medicines and tools. In an incident highlighting both crises, a gang of fifteen armed men stormed a hospital last month to free their leader, a drug trafficker known as ""Fat Family,"" killing a patient.In addition to petty crime threats, authorities say evidence exists that Islamic State jihadists are planning a terrorist attack on the Olympics itself. Brazilian officials say that an Islamic State Portuguese-language channel has been found on the encrypted app Telegram, popular with the Islamic State.Brazilian officials have designated a 22,000-strong military presence at the Olympics. Officials have also begun proceedings to create a special police and military tribunal to be used in the event of accusations of police brutality or excessive use of force, which they say will allow officers to work without fear of being brought to civilian court.","breitbart","right","16989","zika",619

All of the countries are in the Latin America and Caribbean region, except for two: Samoa (Oceania/Pacific) and Cape Verde (Africa).Health officials are telling female residents of several of those countries to avoid becoming pregnant, notes CNN.MarketWatch learned that Southwest, in response to the Zika virus outbreak, reiterates its current policies, pointing out that ""as always, Southwest customers can change their travel itineraries without a change fee, and even our most restrictive, non-refundable fares can be fully applied toward future travel as long as the reservation is canceled 10 minutes prior to the scheduled departure of their flight.""""All the airlines said they are constantly reviewing their policies on refunds and changes to bookings.

"With debate growing over the safety of holding the Olympics in Brazil amid the ongoing Zika virus outbreak, the World Health Organization's Emergency Committee on Zika will meet in the coming weeks to evaluate the risks tied to going on with the Games in August, a WHO spokeswoman said on Friday.""The Emergency Committee meeting will consider the situation in Brazil, including the question of the Olympics,"" WHO spokeswoman Nyka Alexander told Reuters in response to a query.WHO makes risk assessments of a public health issue and it would be up to the International Olympics Committee (IOC) to decide on holding the event in Rio de Janeiro, due to start on Aug. 5, she said.""It is not within our mandate"" to make decisions on holding the Olympic Games, Alexander said.A spokesman for Rio 2016 said they continue to follow WHO recommendations on Zika.Athletes will have to make their own decisions as to whether to risk Zika for the potential glory of Olympic gold. Cyclist Tejay Van Garderen this week withdrew from consideration for the U.S. team over concerns that the virus could present risks for his pregnant wife.The virus can also be transmitted via unprotected sex with an infected man.Dr. David Heymann, chairman of the WHO committee of independent experts, told Reuters on Monday that postponing the Rio Olympics because of fears it could speed the spread of the Zika virus would give a ""false"" sense of security because travelers are constantly going in and out of Brazil.It will be winter in Brazil when the Olympics begin, so the mosquitoes that carry the virus will be less abundant, WHO experts said.A public letter was issued last week signed by 150 public health experts and scientists calling for the Olympics to be delayed or moved over fears that the Games could speed up the global spread of the Zika virus.Top U.S. health officials agreed with WHO experts that Zika did not pose enough of a risk to postpone or move the Olympics. Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, last week said travel to the Olympics would represent less than one quarter of 1 percent of all travel to Zika-affected areas, and that the risk was low except for pregnant women.For women who are pregnant or hoping to become pregnant, the recommendation is to stay away from areas with Zika outbreaks.It has been determined that Zika is a cause of microcephaly, a rare birth defect characterized by unusually small head size and potentially severe developmental problems.World health officials on Friday expressed concern that Zika may cause a far wider range of severe abnormalities in babies and called for broader surveillance beyond microcephaly of infants born in the 37 countries and territories in the Americas, where Zika has been spreading.In hardest hit Brazil, authorities have confirmed more than 1,400 cases of microcephaly believed to be linked to Zika.U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen had asked WHO to examine whether the Games in Rio de Janeiro could accelerate global spread of the mosquito-borne virus.Alexander said the date for the next meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee was still being decided, but that it would be held this month.Heymann told Reuters that it was tentatively set for June 21. The panel of independent experts meets every three months and its last meeting was on March 8.Heymann also said national health authorities should advise their respective athletes and citizens of child-bearing age to protect themselves against mosquito bites with repellents while in Brazil and to practice safe sex on return for at least three weeks.(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva and Bill Berkrot in New York; editing by Andrew Roche and G Crosse)","huffingtonpost","left","16958","zika",648
"WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Tuesday took its first vote on a measure that would direct $1.1 billion in emergency funding to help health officials combat the spreading Zika virus.Democrats and the White House wanted more -- a total of $1.9 billion -- and the House wants to authorize far less. It puts the two chambers at odds, potentially further dragging out the debate as health officials struggle to understand the virus beyond its cause of the birth defect microcephaly.While the emergency measure advanced on Tuesday doesn't fulfill the entire amount requested by the White House, Democrats voted to push the provision toward final passage -- which should come later this week. Other options were presented alongside it: either take funds from other programs, or fully fund the administration's $1.9 billion request.Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who brokered the emergency provision that ultimately passed in a 68-29 procedural vote with Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), called the money a ""downpayment"" on the president's original proposal. ""It would provide much-needed relief for Puerto Rico, backfill nearly $100 million in essential public health funding the administration was forced to reprogram, invest in prevention and support services for pregnant woman and families at home and abroad, and put research dollars toward developing a vaccine,"" Murray said on the Senate floor.Ahead of the vote series, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) urged his Republican colleagues to ultimately support fully funding the president's plan, and respond to Zika with a sense of ""urgency.""""Why take the chance that at some point this summer we could have a significant and serious outbreak in the United States of America, and everybody here is going to be back in their home state doing their campaign stuff,"" Rubio said. ""You're going to have to come back here ... and explain to people why when doctors and medical experts were warning us that this was a significant risk we decided to lowball it, we decided to spend less than what's being called for.""Rubio warned Republicans in the House, who put forward a $622 million measure (a third of the administration's proposal), to ""not play with fire."" The proposal offered by House Republicans would take money from current health programs to deal with the mosquito-borne disease. Republican leaders in the House argue the fresh money would be an addition to the $600 million the White House has already redirected toward Zika from previously-appropriated Ebola funds. Attempting to reach Republicans in the House, Rubio argued that the way Zika ""impacts unborn children alone should call us to action.""""At the end of the day, these are the people we should be fighting for, and we can quite frankly do much better than what the House is proposing,"" he said.The number of travel-related Zika cases reported in the U.S. is 1,200, including those in Puerto Rico, which is expected to be hit hard by the disease. The commonwealth confirmed its first Zika-related microcephaly case this month.On Tuesday, the White House issued a veto threat against the House's $622 million proposal, which would dip again into Ebola funds. In its statement the administration called the House measure ""woefully inadequate to support the response our public health experts say is needed.""","huffingtonpost","left","16938","zika",557
"The World Health Organization (WHO) is recommending the governments of Europe begin preparations against the Zika virus now, before spring and summer.""Every European country in which Aedes mosquitos are present can be at risk for the spread of Zika virus disease,"" wrote Dr. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO's regional director for Europe. ""A number of travellers infected with Zika have entered Europe, but the disease has not been transmitted further, as the mosquito is still inactive. With the onset of spring and summer, the risk that Zika virus will spread increases.""She added, ""Now is the time for countries to prepare themselves to reduce the risk to their populations. As there is no vaccine or treatment for Zika virus disease, we must protect the European Region by stopping the disease at its source.""Jakab provided these ideas:Scientists believe a legal vaccine is still a decade away, but an emergency shot could be in use by the end of the year.The United Kingdom announced plans to fumigate all planes that land ""from countries affected by the Zika virus."" They are already sterilized inside to prevent malaria.Spain confirmed a pregnant woman has the virus after she returned from Colombia. The Health Ministry stated she is ""one of seven confirmed cases in Spain."" Denmark and Switzerland also reported citizens diagnosed with Zika after they returned from Latin America and the Caribbean.WHO declared Zika a public health emergency on February 1 due to the thousands of cases of the virus linked to birth defects in newborn children.""I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities reported in Latin America following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014 constitutes a public health emergency of international concern,"" announced WHO's director general, Margaret Chan.Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which occurs when the brain does not fully form during pregnancy or after birth. This leads to serious mental disabilities.Following the outbreak of Zika, Brazil has discovered more than 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked an excess of 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014. Colombia confirmed more than 2,100 pregnant women have the virus.Brazil has confirmed two cases of infections through blood transfusions. Campinos Health Secretary Cármino de Souza said the government was not previously able to confirm the infections ""because they were initially suspected of being infected with dengue, another mosquito-borne virus.""The American Red Cross has urged people not to donate blood ""if they traveled to Latin America or the Caribbean in the past 28 days.""

"The National Institutes of Health confirmed that the Zika virus outbreak has reached pandemic levels in Latin America.""You have multiple countries in South America and in the Caribbean, so by anybody's definition that would be considered a pandemic,"" explained Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases branch at the institute.His comments come after experts and the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the disease had ""explosive pandemic potential."" Marcos Espinal, head of Communicable Diseases and Health Analysis for the WHO's regional satellite, the Pan American Health Organization, predicted the world could see ""3 to 4 million cases of Zika virus disease.""Doctors in the U.S. have confirmed at least 31 Zika cases.""If you have this much Zika in South America and the Caribbean, sooner or later we're going to see a local transmission,"" continued Fauci. ""Most of the United States goes through a real winter and that's very, very important in containing mosquito-borne viruses.""Aedes aegypti mosquitos carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations. (Chile and Canada are the exceptions.) They also carry Dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya. Doctors found the disease in one infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, a disorder in which an infant's skull is too small to fit his or her brain. This leads to serious mental disabilities.Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the outbreak of Zika, however, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.Latin America may receive emergency vaccines by the end of the year, even though experts believe a legalized vaccine is still ten years away.""This vaccine is easy to produce. It could be cranked to very high levels in a really short time,"" commented Gary Kobinger, a Canadian scientist working on a vaccine.Human testing could begin in August. He also hopes governments will allow usage of the vaccines without full approval due to the outbreak.Scientists base the vaccine on those used for Dengue fever and West Nile virus. No one produced a vaccine for West Nile because scientists could not find a company to distribute it. They should not run into this problem with Zika.""We're already talking to a few companies who are able to partner with us in advanced development,"" Fauci told the media.","breitbart","right","16830","zika",458
"Officials in Rio de Janeiro are identifying two cases of Zika virus infection every hour. A report from O Globo highlights the role neglect among Brazilian officials has played in allowing mosquito infestation in many of the nation's urban hubs.O Globo reported the government reported 1,499 notifications of the disease in the first 29 days of 2016. Doctors confirmed 64 Zika cases among those. Despite the outbreak, officials have not demanded that hospitals report confirmed Zika cases for tracking. Edimilson Migowski, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), claims the ""records of suspected cases account for only 2% of the total number of infected people, which is close to 75,000.""Migowski also blamed the city council for the disease because officials have not held an Index Survey on the Aedes aegypti mosquito since last October. These surveys track Aedes aegypti mosquitos, which carry the Zika virus. Silvia Cavalcantti, graduate coordinator in Microbiology UFF [Fluminense Federal University], placed the same complaint.""Working with a LIRAa [the survey] is something basic,"" she explained. ""Knowing the most affected areas is essential to promote more intensive actions against epidemics. If the surveys show that an area is at risk, agents can be relocated to minimize the effects.""She added: ""In addition, the work must be done all year. It's no use fighting the vector seasonally.""In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned dengue and chikungunya, diseases spread by the same mosquitos, would dominate in 2015. Last January, doctors attempting to diagnose these diseases recorded patients experiencing low-grade fevers and joint pain, which do not fit the symptoms of those diseases. They urged the government not to classify the cases as dengue.""But the authorities were slow to believe,"" said Carlos Brite, a doctor in Recife, the epicenter of Zika.Officials finally acknowledged Zika in May. Claudio Maierovitch, director of the health ministry's Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance, insisted they received the warnings ""too early"" and science showed them that Zika only causes mild fevers without major complications. It took them another six months to link the disease to microcephaly, which causes infants to develop skulls too small for their brains.Gubio Soares, a virologist at the Federal University of Bahia in Brazil, discovered some of the earliest cases of Zika in April 2015. He recently told reporters he never received funding for research and the government never reached out to him.""I have no funding for Zika,"" he said. ""I've never been invited by any official to develop a research project.""O Globo also reported the Ministry of Health ""stressed"" that officials continue to gather information about Aedes aegypti, but residents in poor cities like Rocinha and affluent neighborhoods like Alto Leblon have noticed standing water and neglect from state workers.""In the last two years, no one from the city has done mosquito surveys,"" said Ednaldo, who has worked in the neighborhood for 27 years. ""The agents arrive with a piece of paper, sign it, and then do nothing. Previously they put larvicidal powder into the drains and saucers of plants. But there are more. If you do a survey on the street, you will find many mosquito breeding grounds.""Ednaldo also criticized the residents in the neighborhood.""Dwellers in my building let water accumulate in saucers,"" he exclaimed. ""People here are the type who ask to save water, but also allow a child to play two hours outside with the hose. It is carelessness.""Community organizer José Martins has not witnessed any inspections from state workers in Rocinha.""For decades we have been advocating for improvements in sanitation as the number one priority for public investments here while the government has insisted on flashier interventions that do not save money on healthcare costs down the line,"" he vented. ""Street carnival parades pass through here as well. People live here where there is already a higher instance of tuberculosis and other diseases.""The National Institutes of Health confirmed that the Zika virus outbreak has reached pandemic levels in Latin America.""You have multiple countries in South America and in the Caribbean, so by anybody's definition that would be considered a pandemic,"" explained Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases branch at the institute.","breitbart","right","16832","zika",709
"On Monday, the World Health Organization declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"" due to the cluster of birth defects potentially linked to Zika virus.  No one is probably more concerned about this connection than the world's pregnant women, especially those who are living in an area where there is ongoing Zika virus transmission. While the virus' symptoms (fever, headache, joint pain, conjunctivitis) are no cause for alarm and rarely require hospitalization, the disease is suspected of causing severe birth defects like microcephaly, when a baby is born with an abnormally small head. Scientists fear that exposure to Zika virus in the womb may cause some fetus' brains to stop developing normally, resulting in potential lifelong setbacks like intellectual disability and developmental delays. The ""PHEIC"" designation, only the fourth of its kind in WHO history, will draw international resources to help study the association between the mosquito-borne disease and devastating birth defects like microcephaly, potentially expediting research on diagnostic tests, vaccines and cures for the disease. Here's what pregnant women need to know about the WHO's recent announcement:WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan emphasized that the PHEIC declaration was not a ban on trade or travel. Because Zika virus itself has such mild symptoms, officials explained, it doesn't warrant such restriction.This echoes WHO's similar caution against trade and travel bans during the 2014 to 2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.Chan said that pregnant women could consider delaying their travel to a Zika virus-affected area. If a woman does need to travel, she should get advice from her doctor first and take special care to prevent mosquito bites.This advice echoes the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's strong warning that pregnant women in the U.S. postpone travel to a Zika-affected destination if possible. The CDC also advises women who want to become pregnant to talk to their doctors before making the trip. The agency has upgraded 30 countries and territories with ongoing Zika virus transmission to a ""level 2"" health warning as of Wednesday.These countries and territories are: American Samoa, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Samoa, Suriname, Tonga, Venezuela and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Barring postponement, pregnant women and all people who travel to these 28 destinations should follow strict mosquito bite prevention protocol by wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellant and treating their clothes and gear with the insecticide permethrin.Once back from their trip, pregnant women should be sure to tell their OB/GYN about their travel so that they can come up with a schedule for monitoring the fetus' growth over the course of the pregnancy, advises the CDC. Dr. Amanpreet Bhullar, an OB/GYN at Orlando Health Physician Associates, praised WHO's actions for the message it sends to the general public -- especially pregnant women.""[Its] impact on decisions to avoid travel and behaviors to minimize risk of infection will hopefully help to keep the number of mothers and infants affected to the lowest number possible,"" she told HuffPost.During the PHEIC announcement, Chan directly addressed the millions of pregnant women living in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission. Like travelers, they should wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, as well as mosquito repellant. And because the Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that transmits Zika virus, is an aggressive daytime biter, she also advised pregnant women to minimize outdoor activities and sleep under a mosquito net if they take afternoon naps. Countries should also make sure women of childbearing age and pregnant women have all the information they need to reduce risk of Zika virus exposure. Pregnant women who believe they have been exposed to the virus should also be counseled and followed for birth outcomes, according to advice WHO released when declaring the PHEIC.Chan acknowledged there's no definitive proof that Zika virus can cause birth defects, but she did say there was a ""strong association in time and space"" between Zika infections and a rise in birth defects and neurological complications.The rise in babies born with birth defects in Brazil coincides with the largest-ever Zika virus outbreak to date. Brazil notes that Zika first began spreading May 2015; the country recorded more than 4,000 reported cases of microcephalic births between Oct. 2015 and Jan 2016. As of Jan. 23, health officials are continuing to investigate these initial diagnoses and have been able to confirm 270 and discard 462 of them.Zika virus broke out in French Polynesia beginning in 2013, and an estimated 11 percent of the population sought treatment for symptoms. Health officials there released a report about 17 cases of central nervous system abnormalities in fetuses and infants during 2014 to 2015, around the same time the virus was spreading throughout the islands.None of the mothers involved reported experiencing Zika virus symptoms, but four of them did test positive for some kind of previous flavivirus infection, the genus of viruses that includes Zika. ","huffingtonpost","left","16833","zika",971

Vern Buchanan said. ""People's lives are at stake - the time for inaction is over.""Mr. Buchanan was the first House Republican to back President Obama's request for $1.9 billion in emergency spending to combat Zika virus, which is swirling in Latin America and Puerto Rico and can cause serious birth defects in infants born to infected mothers.Instead, congressional negotiators are reconciling a House plan that takes $622 million from the lingering fight against Ebola in West Africa and other health accounts to fight Zika with a Senate plan that posts $1.1 billion without paying for it with cuts elsewhere in the federal budget.Negotiators appeared close to agreement on a spending level last week, but remain stuck on how, or even whether, to offset the money or tack the expense onto the deficit so that taxpayers foot the bill later on.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded more than 750 travel-related cases of Zika in the 50 states and D.C., a handful of them through sexual transmission, though experts say the virus could puncture the mainland further once summer ramps up and Aedes mosquitoes flourish.Mr. Buchanan challenged his colleagues to finish up their work before the virus begins to spread by insect bite.""We need to listen to the health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and give them the resources they need to control the devastating health impact of this disease,"" Mr. Buchanan said.So far, three babies have been born in the U.S. with birth defects that resulted from Zika infection, according to the CDC.Sen.

The CDC responded with an adivorsy for people to take precautions to prevent transmission of the virus. This latest discovery forced the center to issue another Health Advisory Notice (HAN) ""to underscore the importance of adhering to the interim guidance published on February 5."" These include pregnant women asking their male partners about possible Zika contact. They also asked everyone to use condoms until further notice since no one knows for sure how long Zika survives in sperm.""Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,"" explained Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director.

"If you've been paying attention to the news, you've probably seen headlines about the Zika virus outbreak, which began in Brazil and is now spreading to other countries in Latin America. The virus is spread through mosquito bites, and common symptoms of the disease include rash and joint pain. The disease is usually mild and rarely requires hospital treatment.That is, unless you're a pregnant woman. After the outbreak in Brazil, authorities have reported numerous cases where the virus was linked to severe malformalities in babies whose mothers were infected while pregnant, including microcephaly, which is a condition where the baby is born with an abnormally small head and severe brain damage. As a result, several countries in the region, including Brazil, El Salvador, Jamaica, Colombia and Honduras, have urged women not to get pregnant and advised foreign pregnant women against traveling to the region until further notice. El Salvador's Deputy Health Minister has taken the most extreme stance so far -- urging women in El Salvador to postpone pregnancy until 2018.Advising pregnant women to not travel to these countries while the outbreak is happening makes perfect sense. This is something that individuals can control -- we can choose to change, postpone or cancel our travel plans to countries where the Zika virus is present, to protect our own health and that of our unborn children. But advising women living in these countries to delay pregnancy is a whole other matter -- because for most of them, decisions related to family planning and their reproductive health are not in their control. That is why such advice and recommendations are likely to have little if any real impact, unless they are also accompanied by changes in the availability and affordability of sexual and reproductive health services and contraceptives -- as well as a drastic change in attitudes towards contraception use and family planning. The discussion can also not happen in a void, but must be grounded in a broader debate about the complexities and challenges related to subpar availability of family planning services and contraceptives to both women and men in Latin America.Not only do women in Latin America lack access to sexual and reproductive health and family planning services and often have no access to contraceptives, many of them also lack the necessary knowledge to be able to control if and when they get pregnant. Latin America and Caribbean has an estimated 1. 2 million unintended pregnancies just among adolescents every year. Nearly half of sexually active young women in the region have an unmet need for contraception -- making it near impossible for them to control their reproductive choices and reliably avoid an unwanted pregnancy. As the region is predominately Roman Catholic, the church's condemnation of contraceptives seems to be quite a contradiction to the recommendation for women to delay pregnancy. So far, the statements made by government officials have also categorically ignored the role and responsibility of men in all of this -- after all, it usually takes two people for a woman to get pregnant. As long as women cannot conceive a baby alone, they should not be expected to bear the responsibility of avoiding unwanted pregnancies alone either. What's making the situation even worse is the fact that in most of these countries, abortion is either fully illegal or very hard to obtain -- leading women's rights groups to call for changes to existing abortion laws and bans, particularly in the extreme case of El Salvador where abortion is banned even in a case of fetal deformation.Releasing reliable and factual information about the Zika virus is absolutely crucial for pregnant women to be able to take necessary precautions to minimize their risk of getting infected, but providing that information is only a tiny part of the efforts that need to be undertaken to protect women and their babies from the disease. Without the tools -- sexual education, family planning services and contraceptives -- telling women to ""delay pregnancy"" is, in all honesty, total hypocrisy. It's like telling a person standing in the rain to ""not get wet"" and not give them an umbrella -- despite the fact that you're holding the umbrella in your hand. We know what women need to control their reproductive choices. We know what women need to decide if, when and with whom to get pregnant. But as long as these things are not made available unplanned and unwanted pregnancies will continue to happen, which should not only be considered a problem because of the Zika virus but in general. Having control over our bodies is not a matter of necessity because of the outbreak -- it's a basic human right that all women should have access to, at all times. The Zika virus is merely reminding us of the multiple devastating things that can happen when women are stripped of their basic right to control their bodies and reproductive choices.Originally published on Girls' Globe.","huffingtonpost","left","16829","zika",831
"The Brazilian government made efforts to warn revelers before the annual Carnival celebrations to protect themselves from the Zika virus by wearing long-sleeved clothing and avoiding kissing and sexual contact, particularly pregnant women.A number of pregnant women disregarded the alerts, however, taking their chances with the Zika pandemic to enjoy what Carnival has to offer.The Carnival celebrations, which precede the Catholic Lenten period every year, tend to be a flurry of dancing, flamboyant but revealing outfits, and a contest ""where kissing as many people as possible is a top pastime,"" as the Associated Press noted. Brazil's health authorities attempted to quell this risky behavior with a number of suggestions, including avoiding kissing strangers and the sweaty crowds of Carnival in general. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a wing of Brazil's Ministry of Health, suggested pregnant women avoid Carnival entirely, and added that the partners of pregnant women have ""an additional responsibility"" not to go to Carnival and engage in risky behavior that may result in their partner contracting the virus.While dozens of Brazilian cities were forced to cancel Carnival celebrations, some using the funds, instead, for Zika prevention and research, the nation's largest parties went on. The Zika fear was present in a number of outfits, as revelers disguised themselves as the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the disease, pretending to sting people. While the Aedes aegypti bite is the most common way humans contract Zika, at least one case of sexual transmission has been confirmed and multiple cases of contamination through blood transfusions. Traces of Zika have been found in human saliva and urine, leading officials to warn against kissing strangers.The full scope of the danger of contracting the Zika virus remains unknown. Eighty percent of patients who test positive for Zika have no symptoms, and most adults experience only mild symptoms if they notice their infection at all. Pregnant women, however, face a much more dire threat: the potential that their child will be born with microcephaly, a condition in which a child is born with a skull too small for its brain, causing severe neurological damage.Brazil celebrated Carnival with its usual bombast despite the Zika outbreak - now a ""pandemic"" - leading many pregnant women to disregard the advice. ""I'm not worried. First they say one thing, then they say another. Who knows what's really happening anyway?"" Julia Silva, wearing a halter top that exposed her pregnant belly, told PBS while attending the festivities in Recife. She admitted to not wearing insect repellent. Another pregnant woman, Flavia Nicacio, told PBS she could not resist attending Carnival, but at least ""I'm wearing all these clothes,"" she stated, noting her seasonally inappropriate pants and long shawl.At least one pregnant woman PBS found at Carnival refused to identify herself because, she said, ""I'm a doctor and  I am setting a terrible example.""Many of the pregnant women who stayed home told PBS they did so mostly because their pregnancy made them unable to spend too many hours partying without feeling uncomfortable. ""I'm seven months pregnant, and I'm tired,"" Camila Clarissa Chagas told the outlet.Chinese state outlet Xinhua found not only pregnant women at Carnival, but an event dedicated to young mothers called ""Bloco Umbilical Cord""-""bloco"" being the traditional name for the independent block parties that are divided throughout the city. ""It is impossible to stay home with a small girl during Carnival,"" Gabriela Ortis, eight months pregnant with a second child, told Xinhua.As Carnival is celebrated worldwide, at least one outlet encouraged pregnant women to attend. The Spain-based ""Embarazo10"" published a listicle of creative Carnival disguises for pregnant women, many requiring the woman to bare her belly. ""Make everyone take a look at your belly without it having to be because you are pregnant,"" the listicle reads.

"Amidst the controversy over the possible link between the Zika virus and microcephaly in unborn babies, El Salvador's Ministry of Health reported this week that 13 women infected with the disease had given birth to healthy babies with no signs of microcephaly.The abortion industry has seen in the Zika epidemic a rare opportunity to push for abortion-on-demand in Latin American countries that current restrict or prohibit abortion, in what some are calling the ""silver lining"" of the health crisis.Instead of looking for remedies to counteract the spread of the virus, some are playing into fears and exploiting the crisis to create panic.El Salvador tops the list of countries targeted by Planned Parenthood and other abortion advocacy groups, since it has been called the nation with ""the world's strictest anti-abortion law.""""What happens in a country where abortion is completely illegal?"" said Angélica María Rivas of ACDA, a Salvadoran partner of Planned Parenthood that agitates for the decriminalization of abortion. ""What can be expected is an increase in the rates of illegal abortions, unsafe abortions and a mental health issue for women.""Even though there have been no confirmed cases of microcephaly in El Salvador, Salvadoran officials have cautioning women not to get pregnant for two years to avoid the Zika virus, a measure that health advocates have called wildly unrealistic.Giselle Carino, deputy director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation's (IPPF) Western Hemisphere Region, called El Salvador's response to the Zika virus ""insufficient at best,"" but said she hopes it will move legislators to reconsider their ban on abortion.The mainstream media has enthusiastically supported the abortion industry in its crusade to have abortion laws relaxed, with headlines such as ""How Anti-Abortion Laws in the Americas Are Fuelling the Zika Virus Epidemic"" (The Independent); ""If Women with Zika Risk Shouldn't Get Pregnant, They Need Abortion Access"" (The Guardian); ""The Abortion Rights Dystopia Brought On by the Zika Crisis"" (Jezebel).The pro-abortion Center for Reproductive Rights, based in New York City, has also organized an online petition demanding that the government of El Salvador legalize abortion for women who contract the Zika virus.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), however, have said that ""further studies are needed to better distinguish this relationship"" between Zika and microcephaly, and have stressed that ""the virus does not cause infections in a baby is conceived after the virus is removed from the blood.""The Health Minister of El Salvador, Violeta Menjíva, said that since the virus was detected in the country, infections have been discovered in 159 pregnant women, who are all receiving regular sonograms and are ""being properly inspected and checked by the Ministry of Health.""The birth of thirteen healthy babies to women infected with the Zika virus is a welcome sign that microcephaly is not the guaranteed outcome of the malady, which may help diminish the panic provoked by those who have anything but the health of mothers and their babies at heart.Follow Thomas D.

"This story was originally published by FactCheck.org.Q: Did genetically modified mosquitoes cause the Zika outbreak?A: No. In fact, GM mosquitoes may be able to help control the virus' spread.Any truth to Zika virus linked to genetically modified mosquitoes released through the Gates Foundation?The rumor that GM mosquitoes could be behind the Zika outbreak in Brazil began on Jan. 25 with a Reddit thread titled: ""Genetically modified mosquitoes released in Brazil in 2015 linked to the current Zika epidemic?"" Some media outlets, including Fox News, The Ecologist and The Daily Mail went on to spread the rumor. Some websites, such as Natural News, cited the involvement of Bill Gates. (The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided $19.7 million for a project to develop and test GM mosquitoes, according to Science.)The initial Reddit post was a reaction to the Zika virus' spread through the Americas, including Brazil, and a rise in suspected cases of microcephaly, which can signify abnormal brain development. The Zika virus likely spread to Brazil around August 2014, as reported by the New York Times. As of Feb. 5 this year, the World Health Organization reported that Brazilian authorities estimate between 497,593 and 1,482,701 cases of Zika infection have occurred since the outbreak began. Zika is primarily spread by the Aedes mosquito.The Aedes mosquito also spreads the dengue and chikungunya viruses. To reduce Aedes mosquito populations and combat these widespread viruses, a British biotech company called Oxitec genetically engineered male Aedesmosquitoes to produce offspring that die before they reach adulthood. This technique has been shown to reduce mosquito populations by 95 percent in some areas where Oxitec released the GM mosquitoes. And fewer mosquitoes mean less disease transmission.Why do some claim GM mosquitoes caused the Zika outbreak? The initial Reddit contributor, who posted to a subreddit geared toward conspiracies, included three reasons: (1) The mosquitoes were released in the same area as Zika's epicenter; (2) some offspring will still survive and pass on their genes; and (3) GM mosquito and Zika genes will then mix, resulting in a super virus that causes microcephaly.This is all false: (1) Oxitec released its mosquitoes 400 miles away from Zika's epicenter; (2) only a small percentage of offspring survive; and (3) there are no known ways for mosquito genes to infiltrate those of Zika.Nevertheless, a newly released survey indicated that more than a third of Americans believe the rumor. The Annenberg Science Knowledge survey, which was conducted between Feb. 12 and Feb. 16, asked respondents which statement came closer to their view: ""Genetically modified mosquitoes have caused the spread of the Zika virus OR Genetically modified mosquitoes could minimize the spread of the Zika virus?"" Thirty-five percent said GM mosquitoes caused the spread, 43 percent said minimize the spread, and 19 percent said they didn't know.Fifty-one percent of those polled also said that they are concerned that the Zika virus will spread to where they live. The Aedes mosquito distribution does extend to parts of the southern and eastern United States and Hawaii, but, as of Feb. 17, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported no locally transmitted cases of Zika to the United States (beyond some local cases in U.S. territories). The CDC did, however, report 82 cases associated with travel to Zika-infected regions, such as Brazil.Oxitec first engineered its Aedes mosquitoes to combat the spread of the dengue and chikungunya viruses, but the same mosquitoes also transmit Zika. As a result, the company recently began discussing its technology's potential to combat Zika.So how are GM mosquitoes made? Oxitec engineered its male mosquitoes by disrupting their DNA, such that they produce offspring that are inviable in the absence of tetracycline, an antibiotic. Researchers took advantage of a mechanism that normally occurs within the cell to do this.Within the cell, an enzyme called the transposase has the job of recognizing specific sequences of DNA, binding to them and then catalyzing the movement of that section of DNA to another part of the genome. In other words, the transposase cuts and pastes DNA from one section of the genome to another. That's why scientists like to call these sequences of DNA ""jumping genes.""Taking advantage of this mechanism, Oxitec researchers inserted a gene that leads to developmental problems in the GM mosquitoes' offspring. But if mosquito larva are reared on tetracycline, this gene is deactivated and normal development ensues.Once released, the GM males go on to mate with wild females, who only mate once in their lifetime. With each release of the male GM mosquitoes, more pairs produce inviable offspring, and the overall mosquito population decreases within a given area. And when there are fewer mosquitoes to pass on dengue and Zika, there's less opportunity for people to catch the viruses.Still, some people believe GM mosquitoes are causing the Zika outbreak. We'll explain why the claims made in the initial Reddit post were wrong.The Reddit contributor starts by implying that the area where Oxitec released the GM mosquitoes is the same area where ""all the deformed babies are being born."" That's false.Oxitec first released GM mosquitoes in Brazil near Juazeiro, Bahia, which is roughly 400 miles away from the epicenter of the Zika outbreak in Recife, Pernambuco. That's like claiming Washington, D.C., is the same area as Boston.Moreover, the Reddit contributor inaccurately stated that GM mosquitoes were released in Juazeiro do Norte -- a different city than Juazeiro, Bahia, that's still 300 miles away from Recife.Mosquitoes can't travel very far. According to the World Health Organization, the Aedesmosquito, which transmits Zika, has a lifetime flight range of around 400 meters -- that's 0.25 miles.Also, Oxitec released GM Aedes mosquitoes near Juazeiro, Bahia, between 2011 and 2013, not 2015, as the thread title claimed. Moscamed, one of Oxitec's partners, did release more GM mosquitoes between 2013 and 2015 in Jacobina, Bahia. But this is roughly 440 miles away from Recife by air.Since April 2015, Oxitec also has been releasing GM mosquitoes in Piracicaba, São Paulo. This is even further from Recife, at roughly 1,320 miles away. Not to mention the Zika outbreak had already started by then.Matthew Warren, a press officer at Oxitec, told us that the locations we cite above include all of the releases of GM mosquitoes in Brazil.As we explained previously, scientists have wondered whether Zika causes microcephaly because rises in reported cases of the virus matched increases in reported cases of the birth defect in time and place. But for GM mosquitoes, a similar correlation has not been found. As a result, there is no epidemiological evidence to support the claim that GM mosquitoes caused the Zika outbreak or an increase in reported cases of microcephaly.The Reddit contributor does correctly point out that researchers found roughly 4 percent of the GM mosquito offspring ""survive to adulthood in the absence of the tetracycline antibiotic."" But that's only in a laboratory setting.Glen Slade, director of Oxitec's Brazilian branch, told Discover that it is ""unlikely that the survival rate is anywhere near that high in the harsher field conditions since offspring reaching adulthood will have been weakened by the self-limiting gene.""Even in the lab, that number should be chopped roughly in half -- only female mosquitoes can transmit Zika because only females bite people. And it should be doubly noted that Oxitec only releases male GM mosquitoes.However, traces of tetracycline, the antibiotic the GM mosquitoes would need to survive, can be found in the environment globally, including in Brazil, due to runoff from agricultural practices, among other causes.In 2015 researchers at Oxitec and elsewhere published a collection of studies that investigated the likelihood that leached tetracycline would increase the survival rates of GM mosquitoes in Brazil. However, their data showed ""that potential routes of exposure of [GM mosquito] individuals to tetracycline and its analogues in the environment are not expected to increase the survivorship of [GM mosquitoes].""Even if a female offspring of a GM mosquito were to survive (and fly significantly outside its normal range), there's no mechanism to explain how the Zika virus and the GM mosquito genes would interact to bring about microcephaly or change the virus' physiology. In other words, some evidence suggests that Zika alone could cause microcephaly, but this has nothing to do with the mosquito - let alone GM mosquitoes. The mosquito is only a carrier of the virus.Still, the Reddit contributor uses a slippery slope argument commonly employed against GMOs: By interacting with the GM mosquito, the contributor wrote, Zika ""could evolve into something far more dangerous than its original incarnation, pulling the lever on the slot machine with every replication until it hits the genetic jackpot.""As we explained above, genes do ""jump"" from one place in the same genome to another. Researchers, including those at Oxitec, can also use this mechanism to insert genes artificially into an organism's genome, thereby making it a genetically modified organism.Viruses have been known to insert their genes by the same process into their host organism's DNA -- but this only occurs with specific kinds of viruses. Some viruses, such as Herpes, have double-stranded DNA as their genetic material. Others only have single-stranded DNA. Others still, including Zika, have only RNA. By comparison, humans -- and all plants and animals for that matter -- have double-stranded DNA.But do host genes ever make it into virus genomes? In other words, could GM mosquito DNA make it into the Zika genome? No, virologist Kenneth Stedman told Discover: ""There are a quite small, but not insignificant, number of examples of partial genomes of RNA and single-stranded DNA viruses that have been incorporated into [host] DNA genomes.  However, there are NO examples of the inverse, that is to say purely RNA viruses or ssDNA viruses picking up genes from host genomes.""In short, there is no known way Zika could ""evolve into something far more dangerous than its original incarnation,"" as the original Reddit contributor claimed -- at least not at the hand of GM mosquitoes.Overall, the rumor that GM mosquitoes are behind the recent Zika outbreak in Brazil is completely ill-founded. The mosquitoes weren't released in the same area; very few offspring survive; and even if they do, there's no mechanism to explain how the mosquitoes' genes could make their way into Zika's genome.Editor's Note: SciCheck is made possible by a grant from the Stanton Foundation.For a list of sources for this story, visit FactCheck.org.Correction, Feb. 23: This article was updated to accurately reflect the Annenberg Science Knowledge survey question on whether GM mosquitoes have caused the spread of the Zika virus or minimized the spread of the virus.  ","huffingtonpost","left","16854","zika",1782
"An effective method to fight the Zika virus may be at the side of a road.The international public health emergency has left researchers and health professionals scrambling to devise a way to put a stop to the virus that is spread by mosquitoes and through sex, and causes microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome at birth.In Brazil, which has been hit hardest by the outbreak, innovators have found a way to kill the disease-carrying mosquitoes wherever they happen to be.Posterscope Brasil recently launched the ""Mosquito Killer Billboard"" in Rio de Janeiro.The mechanism sprays a solution that's a combination of lactic acid and CO2, which mimics human sweat and breath. The fluorescent lights enhance the attraction of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which are known to carry dengue and chikungunya, in addition to the Zika virus. It can lure mosquitoes from up to 2.5 kilometers away. Once the insects are trapped, they become dehydrated and eventually die, according to the group.The project was created under the ""Creative Commons Agreement,"" which would allow any city to replicate the concept.This may prove to be useful as the concern surrounding Zika has quickly spread beyond Brazil.The health department there reported 944 confirmed cases of microcephaly, and most are them are believed to be related to Zika infections in the mother, according to Reuters. Microcephaly cases are typically characterized by patients with unusually small heads and developmental problems. It was first detected in Brazil last year and is now making its way through the Americas.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said there will likely be a ""local outbreak"" in the U.S. He's pressed the administration to budget $1.9 billion dollars in emergency funds to fight the virus. As for using billboards to solve a major crisis, that's something advocates have turned to before.Slovakia, for example, erected billboards in 2014 that doubled as shelters for homeless people. In Lima, the second largest desert capital in the world, a billboard captures air humidity and turns it into potable drinking water. ","huffingtonpost","left","16931","zika",366
"Meet the Aedes aegypti, a tiny blood-sucking mosquito that is causing panic worldwide for its ability to transmit the Zika virus and a host of other diseases that have recently surfaced in the U.S.The mosquito, on the decline since the 1980s in Southern Florida, suddenly surfaced in California under unknown circumstances in 2013. That year saw a major spike of illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America, where the Aedes aegypti has been spreading dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses that have become pandemic in those regions.The Aedes aegypti, commonly referred to as the yellow fever mosquito, is recognizable by white markings on its legs and a lyre marking on the insect's thorax.The mosquitoes primarily breed in closed-container, damp environments such as unused flowerpots, spare tires, untreated swimming pools, and drainage ditches.The virus originated in Africa and has been documented off and on in the U.S. for centuries, although the mosquito's most recent domestic history is fraught with question marks.The mosquito has been ""incriminated as the likely primary vector in historical outbreaks of yellow fever as far north as New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, from the 1690s to the 1820s,"" according to academic research.It has been detected in Florida and some southern states. The climate of South Florida makes the region a good breeding ground and the insect was previously a common disease-spreading vector in the state until the arrival of a rival mosquito, the Asian tiger mosquito, or Aedes albopictus, in 1985.The Epidemiology and Nematology Department at the University of Florida documents:The insect was first detected in significance in California in 2013. Before 2011, the Aedes aegypti was ""rarely detected in California and were not known to persist,"" related an article from the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The journal documented the mosquito's arrival on the West Coast:In September 2015, the insect was also detected for the first time in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.In 2014, the insects were found in offices at San Diego's 32nd Street Naval Station, the Los Angeles Times reported. The same kind of mosquitoes were found on Oct. 7 and Oct. 8, 2014 in the Los Angeles-area counties of Commerce and Pico Rivera.The species has since been detected in Tulare, Kern, Imperial, Orange, and Alameda counties.Another transmitter of similar diseases, the mosquito Aedes albopictus, was detected in Kern and San Diego counties as well as regions of Los Angeles County.Experts have said the Aedes aegypti mosquito arrived on the West Coast through cargo in ships and airplanes although the exact mode of transportation has not been documented.Zika spreading 'explosively'The mosquito has been spreading the Zika virus, which epidemiologists believe is causing an unprecedented outbreak of infants born with small heads in Brazil. The disease is also associated with developmental delays, seizures, and intellectual disabilities in newborns. Last month, after 2,400 babies were born in the country with microcephaly, a neurological disorder, Brazilian health officials took the unusual step of warning women not to get pregnant.Besides the possibility of causing birth defects, according to the CDC, the most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes).The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week. The symptoms are so close to the flu it may be difficult at first to detect.The World Health Organization is set to convene an emergency committee in Geneva on Monday to coordinate a global response to the outbreak, with the agency's head, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, warning the disease is spreading ""explosively.""The Wall Street Journal viewed the WHO's announcement as underscoring ""the speed with which a virus that began as an obscure tropical malady afflicting Africa and then several remote Western Pacific islands has transformed into a major international health concern, particularly in the Americas.""Arrival of dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow feverBesides Zika, the Aedes aegypti also transmits dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever.Breitbart reported Mexico has been experiencing an alarming rise of chikungunya, a painful and sometimes debilitating infection that could potentially spread across the porous border. And there is already evidence of at least one case arriving from Mexico, as Breitbart documented last month.In May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added Mexico to the ""Watch Level 1"" category for chikungunya. In late November, the CDC updated their ""Level 1"" warning, advising travelers to Mexico to ""protect themselves from chikungunya by preventing mosquito bites.""Local chikungunya transmission began in Mexico in October 2014, with 155 cases confirmed before the end of the year. The numbers skyrocketed in 2015, with 9,952 cases reported in Mexico as of November 8.According to CDC data, the U.S. in 2015 has seen 571 chikungunya cases in 42 states as of November 17, with all reported cases coming from ""travelers returning from affected areas.""The news media has spotlighted chikungunya in recent weeks after a new study found the disease can cause severe and potentially fatal brain infection, especially in infants and seniors. The report, published in the journal Neurology, examined a 2005-2006 chikungunya outbreak on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. Scientists found that the rate of encephalitis among those infected with the chikungunya virus outpaced the rate for all encephalitis reported in the U.S. from 1998 to 2010.The most common symptoms of chikungunya are fever and joint pain. Other symptoms include headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash.Migrants, chikungunya and TexasMissing from the discussion is the potential for illegal aliens to bring in Chikungunya from Mexico. One area to watch is clearly the Texas-Mexico border, where dengue is already endemic.Indeed, there is at least one case of transmission from Mexico to Texas.On August 11, 2015, the city of Garland issued the following press release:And Breitbart unearthed a June 2014 dispatch from the Public Health and Environmental Services for Harris County, the most populous county in Texas. The pamphlet on Chikungunya stated, ""Global travel, urbanization, immigration, climate, and presence of the mosquito species known to transmit these diseases in Harris County are all factors that contribute to the possibility of these diseases emerging in our area.""On July 7, 2014, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed the first human case of the disease, reportedly an individual who had traveled to the Caribbean.Two days later, a second case was confirmed, this time in an 18-year-old woman who had returned from a trip to Haiti. By July 23, 2014, a ""handful of Texas residents"" were identified as being infected with the chikungunya in five Texas counties. The next month, Texas was home to at least 14 cases.Nationwide that month, cases in New Jersey more than doubled to 25; New York confirmed 44 cases, and Florida saw a marked increase.These cases came before the Mexico Chikungunya outbreak reached a ""Level 1"" CDC threat.The World Health Organization documented a previous case in which infected migrants introduced chikungunya in 2007 in a coastal village in Italy, sparking an outbreak of 197 cases.In June 2012, Scientific American discussed the disease, as well as other illnesses such as Chagas and dengue fever in the context of possible transmission via illegal aliens crossing the border. ""Since undocumented immigrants are difficult to track, officials have a hard time measuring and treating infected individuals,"" the magazine reported.With research by Brenda J.

"China has confirmed its first case of Zika, a 34-year-old man who traveled to Venezuela. Authorities are particularly concerned that the man stopped in Hong Kong before reaching his final destination, home to a mosquito species potentially capable of carrying the virus.Reuters reports that the unidentified man is from eastern Jiangxi province but works in Guangdong, southern China, and took a connecting flight out of Hong Kong. The man had previously traveled to Venezuela, where the government has recorded some Zika cases, but significantly fewer than in neighboring Colombia and Brazil. The Colombian government has accused Venezuela's socialist regime of hiding the true number of Zika cases and downplaying the threat.The man is said to be recovering after experiencing the common fever, rash, and headache that accompany Zika in cases where patients feel symptoms. Up to 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic.Reuters notes that Hong Kong is responding to the potential of passengers carrying Zika with more thorough inspections at its airport and ""reinforced training for boundary control inspectors."" Hong Kong is especially vulnerable to Zika, the region's Centre for Health Protection notes, and other mosquito-borne illnesses like Dengue and Chikungunya because of the presence of a population of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. While Aedes aegypti is the species known to spread Zika, Aedes albopictus has been known to transmit Dengue, and scientists suspect it, too, could carry the virus.Chinese state news outlet Xinhua has quoted Chinese government officials as saying that the risk of a Zika outbreak similar to that in Latin America is ""extremely low due to low temperature."" Aedes aegypti need warmth and humidity to reproduce. It is currently summer in most of South America, exacerbating the struggle to keep mosquito populations low. A World Health Organization (WHO) representative in China tells Reuters that the organization does expect Zika cases to arrive in China, however, because of ""the volume of travel between China and South America."" ""Chinese health authorities are well prepared to respond to this and any further imported cases,"" the representative added.That the first Chinese case of Zika comes from Venezuela highlights the threat the South American nation poses to the world should accusations of insufficient monitoring of the Zika virus be true. Venezuela has ""no systematic reporting of the data"" regarding the number of Zika cases, according to Colombian Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria. Venezuela has recorded 4,700 suspected Zika cases so far, compared to 20,000 across the border in Colombia, and over a million in Brazil.""We already have a weakened health care system, which tends to make these problems spread more rapidly. Add to that the lack of information and it's a perfect storm,"" Jose Oletta, former Venezuela health minister, said of the Zika crisis. Venezuela is facing almost complete shortages of most common medications, forcing pharmacies to sell veterinary drugs to for human use. It relies heavily on Cuba's doctor slave trade for its health infrastructure.Asian countries have begun responding to the potential of the Zika pandemic in Latin America, as the National Institutes of Health has labeled it, by heightening security at airports. Many southern Asian countries share the tropical climates of Latin America, making them welcome homes for Zika-carrying mosquitos. Singapore, in particular, has invested in strengthening its security, as it is already struggling to reduce the number of cases of Dengue fever. ""There is a high risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. As such, the virus may become endemic in Singapore,"" Singapore's top health agency said last week. Singapore will implement new protective measures at its airports and begin an awareness campaign to prevent people from leaving pools of still water where mosquitos may reproduce.So far, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand have all documented cases of Zika. The government of India, too, is very concerned with the possibility of Zika transmission, both due to its high mosquito population and how densely populated its cities are. ""It would definitely be a big challenge for Asian countries to control the spread of the virus  considering high population in the region,"" infectious disease specialist Om Shrivastav tells AFP.While Zika typically causes mild, if any, symptoms in adults, doctors fear it is linked to an infant deformity known as microcephaly, in which a child is born with a skull too small for his or her brain. Experts are also looking at other, less obvious deformities in infants born to mothers who test positive for Zika. ""Many have fairly severe central nervous system lesions,"" Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease expert at Yale University, says, adding that many are born with a high number of calcium deposits that ""cause seizures and cause impairment in terms of function for the brain.""","breitbart","right","16841","zika",794
"The Zika virus isn't transmitting within the U.S., but pregnant women who contracted the virus elsewhere had abortions or miscarriages upon their return, scientists reported Friday, signaling the virus is striking close to home even as congressional Republicans warned the United Nations not to let ""opportunistic"" advocates roll back abortion laws abroad.The Centers for Disease Control said it confirmed Zika infection in nine pregnant women who had traveled to hard-hit areas, namely Latin America and American Samoa.Among them, two are still pregnant without complication. Yet two women opted for abortion, two had miscarriages and three gave birth, with one of the newborns displaying ""severe"" microcephaly.Scientists have tied microcephaly, in which babies have abnormally small heads, to skyrocketing rates of Zika transmission in Brazil and dozens of other Latin countries with ardently pro-life policies.As a result, the epidemic has reopened debate about a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy if her fetus might be born with severe disabilities.Several Latin countries that restrict access to contraceptives or abortion have urged couples to defer pregnancy, with El Salvador going so far as to ask women to try and wait until 2018.Even Pope Francis has weighed in, suggesting the use of contraceptives to avoid Zika-related defects is not an ""absolute evil,"" though abortion would still be forbidden.>Sensing a threat to anti-abortion laws abroad, House Republicans took their concerns straight to the U.N. on Friday, saying they were alarmed by a top official's suggestion that safe abortion services were part of an international standard for women's reproductive health, as dozens of countries grapple with Zika.""We implore you to clarify your statement to make clear you are not lending your voice to efforts to capitalize on this disease to promote a politically motivated pro-abortion agenda. We hope that your recent remarks do not favor abortion as a public health tool to tackle the Zika virus, and would appreciate a response with your clarification,"" Rep. Blake Farenthold, Texas Republican, and 50 other lawmakers said in a letter to Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the U.N.'s high commissioner on human rights.They said the U.N. risked mimicking advocates who have already targeted pro-life laws in El Salvador and other countries.Meanwhile, Democrats are heading in the opposition direction, urging Congress to approve President Obama's $1.9 billion request to fight Zika and then promote a ""full range"" of family planning services in affected countries.""Democrats are going to continue urging bipartisan work to ensure women everywhere have the ability to plan their pregnancies, especially in light of this virus,"" Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, said at a Zika hearing last week.As it stands, the mosquito-borne Zika virus is transmitting locally in Puerto Rico, but not the U.S. mainland.The CDC's latest case study, however, suggests the disease is already impacting pregnant women on American soil.In one case, a woman in her 30s reported she had traveled to a Zika-affected country during her pregnancy and then developed symptoms of the virus.Imaging showed evidence of the virus in her amniotic fluid and severe brain atrophy in her fetus.""After discussion with her health care providers,"" the CDC said, ""the patient elected to terminate her pregnancy."" ","washingtontimes","right","16857","zika",545
"Hawaii's governor David Ige declared a state of emergency for mosquito-borne illnesses on Sunday, including Zika and dengue fever. The latter has been an especially urgent concern, with over 250 confirmed cases of dengue reported during the current outbreak.The Associated Press reports there have been no reported cases of local Zika transmission in Hawaii. However, the first case of infant brain damage reported in the United States came from Hawaii, where a child with microcephaly was born to a woman who lived in Brazil early in her pregnancy.Six residents of Hawaii are known to have contracted Zika during travels to the outbreak areas. In addition to the South American and Caribbean countries noted as sources of Zika infection, the virus is active on Pacific islands including American Samoa, which enjoys regular air travel with Hawaii.""We are doing everything we can to be prepared, to be proactive, to prevent vector borne diseases here in Hawaii,"" said Governor Ige, when issuing his emergency order.The AP reports Hawaii is ""rushing to build up its mosquito control staff after a December report from the Centers for Disease Control highlighted deficiencies in the state's vector control department,"" since Hawaii ""slashed its moquito control and entomology staff during the economic downturn.""""We are actively hiring new staff, an entomologist that will be dedicated to Hawaii Island that will be starting next week as well as additional communications and vector control staff,"" said state Department of Health director Virginia Pressler, after the governor's emergency order released more funding for the department.Another aspect of the emergency order gives mosquito control officials the ability to spray property with pesticides, even if the owner objects. There has been much controversy about pesticide use in Hawaii over recent years, including allegations that agriculture companies are spraying too many pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides on their crops.Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) described dengue as a ""public health emergency on Hawaii Island"" and said there was an ""emerging threat of a possible Zika crisis,"" when asking for swift approval of additional health funding for his state in Senate Appropriations Committee hearings last week.The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports the state's other Sen.

"Senate Democrats launched a filibuster Tuesday to stop $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus, saying it's not enough money, has too many strings attached and undercuts environmental protections in a rush to eradicate virus-carrying mosquitoes.Even as the White House demands quick action ahead of a predicted summer surge of mosquitoes, President Obama and fellow Democrats said a bad bill was worse than no bill at all, and demanded Republican leaders go back and rewrite the measure to allow Zika money to go to Planned Parenthood.Furious Republicans, who control both chambers, said they've already compromised enough, and said they'll try to wait it out, hoping voters give Democrats an earful back home during a short July 4 vacation this weekend.""We need to act and we need to act right now,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, refusing to reopen negotiations.Supporters fell seven votes shy of the 60 needed to overcome the filibuster, with only one Democrat, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, voting with GOP leaders. Two Republican senators voted against the package, meanwhile.The bill cleared the House last week and the Senate has few options other than to pass the compromise as-is, or else kill it, which could send both houses back to square one in their negotiations.

About $750 million of the money is paid for by shifting funds, while the rest is tacked onto the deficit.Mr. Obama has threatened to veto the compromise, saying it was less than the $1.9 billion he requested and it left out critical steps by failing to let Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers dole out contraceptives.Congressional Democrats also balked at the move to waive environmental rules to aid mosquito eradication.""This conference report is the most irresponsible legislation I have ever seen in my 34 years in Congress,"" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat. ""That says a lot. I can't think of anything that's close.""The standoff comes amid increasing worry over local outbreaks of Zika in the states and D.C.Mosquitoes are spreading the disease in Puerto Rico and Latin America, where Brazilians first noticed an uptick in both Zika and microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development.Meanwhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded more than 820 travel-related cases of Zika in the states and D.C., a handful of them through sexual transmission, though experts say the virus could puncture the mainland further once summer ramps up and Aedes mosquitoes flourish.Republicans said Democrats' objections about Planned Parenthood were a smokescreen. They said the crux of the debate was that Democrats wanted to spend more, and not replace it with cuts elsewhere.Democrats defended their stance, saying deficit worries should take a back seat.""An emergency is an emergency,"" Mr. Reid said. ""You can't have offsets for an emergency.""The administration has already shifted more than $500 million over from Ebola-fighting money, and Republicans said combined with the $1.1 billion they've agreed to, it funds all of the emergency parts of the president's request.Mr. Obama, though, wants to backfill the Ebola money, saying the crisis in West Africa could flare up again.Republicans say the package is their final offer.""The negotiations have already occurred,"" Mr. McConnell said, later adding: ""I would say to my Democratic friends there are some disadvantages to not being in the majority.

Besides temperate Canada, Chile is the only country in the Americas where the mosquito that carries the Zika virus is not native.The hardest-hit nation in the outbreak is Brazil, and President Dilma Rousseff said in a Tuesday address to Congress that ""resources will not be lacking"" to deal with the outbreak, which was first detected last year. Brazilian officials have even used military troops to spray mosquito-infested areas.The Capivari municipality in Sao Paulo state announced it was canceling its Carnival celebrations and setting the money aside for Zika prevention measures, including eradicating mosquito breeding grounds.In a statement Tuesday, UNICEF asked for $9 million for anti-Zika programs in the Americas, saying the focus would be on educating Brazilians on avoiding mosquito bites.The disease's impact on international travel spread Tuesday as Swiss Air said female flight-crew members will no longer be required to travel to Brazil if they are ""in the phase of family planning."" And Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline, said it would offer passengers refunds on all flights to Brazil and Argentina. ","washingtontimes","right","16833","zika",571
"Tech giant Google has seen more than a 3,000 percent increase in global search interest in mosquito-borne Zika virus since November. Now they're going to harness that power for good, according to a letter the company posted Thursday.  Google engineers and data scientists will partner with UNICEF to map the virus and anticipate its spread, and the company is providing the aid organization with a $1 million grant to bolster its on-the-ground efforts. Google specifically cited education, community outreach, mosquito eradication and vaccine and diagnostic testing development as the grant's primary focuses, and expects to reach 200 million people in hard-hit Brazil with the money.Google's contribution to fighting Zika is the latest in a series of investments the tech giant and its parent company, Alphabet, have made in health and big data. Alphabet owns two health properties, a biotech company called Calico that's focused on health, wellness and aging, and a health and medicine research organization called Life Sciences.Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean through the Aedes aegypti mosquito and is strongly suspected to be linked to an uptick in cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil. Babies born with microcephaly have smaller heads, which can affect brain development and sometimes results in life-long developmental problems. The virus has also been linked to Guillain-Barre Syndrome, in which the body's immune system attacks the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and, in some cases, paralysis. The Google donation comes on the heels of $1.9 billion request for emergency funds President Barack Obama asked of Congress. The money will be used to research vaccines and diagnostic tests and to aid the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, an area that's considered particularly vulnerable to Zika because of its mosquito-friendly climate and history of mosquito-spread diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya. Check out our full coverage of Zika virus.","huffingtonpost","left","16863","zika",465
"A group of Brazilian lawyers, scientists and activists will petition the country's Supreme Court to allow abortions if a baby would be born with microcephaly, as detailed in the Newsy video above.Microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and serious developmental delays, is strongly linked to the Zika virus that is spreading through South America. The World Health organization declared a state of emergency around the virus on Monday.Scientists have confirmed that Zika can pass from mother to fetus, which means pregnant women are highly at risk for the virus, which has no vaccine or cure. Officials have warned women to avoid getting pregnant, but over half of all pregnancies in countries like Brazil are unplanned. And abortion is illegal in most of the South American countries where Zika is prevalent. Brazil is the epicenter of the Zika outbreak, with 270 confirmed cases of microcephalic babies and 3,448 more under investigation, according to the BBC. ""What we have at this moment, in this country, is a group of women who is in fear of getting pregnant and not knowing what will happen during the pregnancy,"" Debora Diniz, a University of Brasilia law professor, said in the video.Diniz is leading the petition to the Supreme Court, which will be delivered in two months, according to the BBC. The petition claims that ""the Brazilian state is responsible for the Zika outbreak"" because it did not eradicate the mosquito carrying the disease.The relationship between Zika and microcephaly is not yet fully understood. Abortion is illegal in Brazil except when the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape. The only other exception was added 2012, in the case of anencephaly, another rare brain disorder in which the baby is born without parts of its brain and skull. The same group of activists, led by Diniz, campaigned for the anencephaly exception.The Zika emergency is forcing pro-life South American countries to confront their pregnancy and abortion policies, sometimes in bizarre ways. El Salvador suggested women just avoid falling pregnant until 2018, and Colombia advised the same for 6-8 months. Latin America has extremely restrictive abortion laws and and 95% of abortions performed there are unsafe. But even though it is illegal, the reality of abortion is different for rich and poor Brazilians, said Sonia Correa, of the website Sexuality Policy Watch, to PRI.org. She said wealthy women can arrange abortions in private clinics, or hire an attorney to make a case for abortion to a local legal tribunal, whereas poor women can do neither.If the Brazilian petition succeeds, it wouldn't be the first time a disease as sparked a change in abortion laws. As NPR reports, a 1960's rubella outbreak brought abortion to national attention in the U.S., and paved the way to Roe v. Wade. Women with rubella had a 50% chance of giving birth to babies with congenital rubella syndrome, a fact that increased public sympathy for illicit abortions. Katja Iversen, chief executive of the advocacy group Women Deliver, criticized the WHO for focusing on the spread of the virus to the exclusion of reproductive rights. ""Wouldn't it be wonderful to see WHO's reproductive health department involved as well,"" she told The Guardian. ""Yes, it is about a mosquito carrying a dangerous virus, but it is also about a health system failing women."" ","huffingtonpost","left","16833","zika",579
"by BROOKE BOBBThe warnings that have hit the news about the Zika virus are quite alarming, specifically for pregnant women living or planning to travel abroad. The mosquito-borne illness, which can cause fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis, has spread to two dozen countries and territories, mainly in South and Central America. The virus is also being linked to a birth defect found in many newborns in these affected regions, even prompting some countries to advise their residents to postpone pregnancy.While places like Tulum, San Juan, and Barbados might be typically popular travel destinations for vacations, the fear over contracting the virus is deterring many a pregnant would-be visitor. And for good reasonHere, we've rounded up five easily accessible destinations without reports of Zika where you can go before your due date. Just check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for up-to-date information before traveling.Photo: Courtesy of  three-mile-long Harbour Island is one of the most serene settings in the Bahamas. With only nine rooms in the hotel, the Ocean View Club offers a stylish and charming retreat for a quiet, peaceful vacation. There's no spa or swimming pool, but the best part about this place is that it's located right on the island's famous (and quite spectacular) pink-sand beach.Photo: Courtesy of  is for those who don't want to be totally cut off from civilization. Located just off Venice Beach, the Rose is a boho-style bungalow hotel opened in 2014 by photographer Glen Luchford. The lobby and rooms are cozy but minimally decorated, and while there's no proper spa, the hotel can arrange for a special prenatal masseuse to visit your room or suite whenever the mood strikes. It's a very short walk from the beach and all of the amazing restaurants and cafés on Abbot Kinney Boulevard. There's also a rooftop deck for lounging in the sun.Photo: Courtesy of  the end of a stunningly scenic two-hour drive from Reykjavik, you'll spy a simple three-story white home and black church off in the distance--just two specks amid craggy lava fields, Snæfellsjökull glacier, and ocean as far as the eye can see. Welcome to Hótel Búdir, a charming hotel where--despite the otherworldly landscape and myriad outdoor activities--perhaps the most appealing attribute is its unique brand of calm. Read a book while watching sheep waddle by and seals play in the tide, go for a stroll through the tall grasses and mossy rocks, take a snowcat up to the top of the glacier at sunset and bask in the glow.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed Thursday the first U.S. case of male-to-male sexually transmitted Zika. A Dallas man contracted the virus while traveling in Venezuela. Later, in Texas, the man infected his male partner through anal sex.""The present case report indicates Zika virus can be transmitted through anal sex, as well as vaginal sex,"" CDC researchers wrote in their Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report released April 14.In February, Breitbart Texas reported on the nation's first case of male-to-female sexually transmitted Zika, which also happened in Dallas. Similarly, a male partner contracted the virus on travel in a Zika affected country, then infected his female partner through vaginal intercourse. Since that time, the CDC reports at least five more recent cases of male-to-female sexual transmissions involving infected males who traveled to Zika infested areas.The male-to-male sexually transmitted case happened in January, according to the CDC report. It said two days after returning to Dallas from Venezuela, the man who contracted the virus developed characteristic mild Zika symptoms - fever, a rash on his upper body and face, and conjunctivitis which lasted three days. A local health care provider diagnosed the virus. Then, Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) investigated further, learning the man had unprotected sex one day before and one day after the onset of the symptoms. A week after first showing Zika symptoms, the man's partner exhibited similar symptoms. The CDC did not identify the couple, only saying they were in a monogamous relationship for more than 10 years.Additional CDC testing confirmed the man, who traveled to Venezuela, contracted Zika and dengue, although his partner only became infected with Zika. The CDC report noted the man said multiple people living in the Venezuelan area he visited experienced Zika symptoms.In response to this case, the report stated: ""Sexual transmission through both vaginal and anal sex is an emerging mode of Zika virus infection that might contribute to more illness than was anticipated when the outbreak was first recognized.""In February, DCHHS Director Zachary Thompson voiced his concern that as high as 80 percent of those who contract Zika through sexual contact will not have any symptoms. That could lead to further spread of the virus. Health officials caution the next best thing to abstinence is protection. They recommend using condoms to prevent Zika and other sexually-transmitted diseases. Most people who contract Zika have few or mild symptoms.Researchers do not how long Zika stays in semen, but the CDC report suggests it could be for as long as 10 weeks. They say Zika survives in semen longer than in blood.Breitbart News reported the CDC called Zika ""a bit scarier than we initially thought."" The group considered most at-risk from mosquito-born transmissions are pregnant women. On Wednesday, after months of a speculated connection, the CDC concluded the virus was a threat to pregnant women as ""a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects."" They continue to warn pregnant women to avoid travel to Zika affected countries.There have been no reports of Zika locally transmitted by Dallas mosquitoes. The two types of Aedes mosquitoes that carry Zika also spread Dengue fever, prevalent on the Texas-Mexico border, and Chikungunya, which first entered the state in 2014, Breitbart Texas reported. These mosquitoes like to reproduce in standing water close to humans. Experts worry that Houston's economically depressed areas could serve as prime breeding grounds.In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott folded Zika into a state infectious task force, Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported. Dallas County hopes to tackle any potential mosquito-driven outbreak in an existing protocol that combats mosquitoes carrying the West Nile and Chikungunya viruses, and Dengue fever.Dallas health officials pursued local lab testing to expedite the diagnostic process instead of sending suspect blood samples to the Atlanta-based CDC. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston is working on research it hopes will lead to a vaccine. Brazil invested in this research. The University of Texas at Austin created an algae anti-mosquito bio-weapon that may be effective in controlling mosquito population, Breitbart Texas' Bob Price reported. Breitbart News reported the Obama administration wants to reallocate $510 million earmarked West African Ebola fighting funds to instead research Zika.Zika is also linked to increased risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome, rare paralysis disease. Cases increased during the 2014 French Polynesia virus outbreak. The CDC suggested Zika may lead to hearing and vision problems. on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16906","zika",758
"Sen. Marco Rubio begged his Republican colleagues Tuesday to fully fund President Obama's nearly $2 billion request to combat the Zika virus, saying it is really ""the scientists' request"" and that Congress can easily backfill the money if it shows the will.Mr. Rubio, a Florida Republican whose state faces a serious outbreak, has broken with the GOP caucus and supported the $1.9 billion package favored by the White House.The administration wants to treat that money as emergency spending akin to hurricane relief and tack it onto the deficit.Mr. Rubio's willingness to follow that plan puts him at odds with conservative groups who've demanded that any Zika funding be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget.""We can do that, we should do that, I'm in favor of doing that,"" he said of finding the cuts.But he said it would be ""short-sighted"" to wait any longer or ""low-ball"" the U.S. response to Zika, which is causing birth defects in Latin America.Florida accounts for about one in five of the 500 travel-related cases of Zika recorded in the U.S. so far, and the mosquito-borne virus could swirl on its own once temperatures climb.Mr. Rubio also supports a bipartisan plan to pony up $1.1 billion for the Zika fight, although he argued it is a less attractive approach.""Why are we taking this chance? It makes absolutely no sense,"" he said.Mr. Rubio's break with fellow Republicans comes just two months after he ran as a conservative candidate for president.The Floridian lobbied to pay for the Zika package down the road, saying $2 billion for an emergency - unlike entitlement spending - is hardly a major driver for the nation's $18 trillion debt, so it shouldn't be hard to find the money.He also urged lawmakers to divorce the administration from the actual funding request.""Fine, it came from the White House,"" he said. ""But it's really the scientists' requests, the doctors' request, the public health sector's request for how to address this issue."" ","washingtontimes","right","16938","zika",338
"Shame on you both.""This plan from congressional Republicans is four months late and nearly a billion dollars short of what our public health experts have said is necessary to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus, and steals funding from other health priorities."" -White House press secretary Josh EarnestRepublican Speaker Paul Ryan and his GOP ""pro-life"" Congress are anything but pro-life. He is currently reeling from the comeuppance that the Democratic Party sit-in and the media has unleashed on him due to his refusal to hold a vote on a law to prevent terrorists and other psychopaths from massacring Americans with assault weapons.That is not the only criticism of Paul's seemingly pro-death stances that he fights for. He has denied half the critical funding that the Centers for Disease Control have stated unequivocally that they need to prevent and research the vector borne illness Zika. This virus, spread by mosquitos, causes serious complications for unborn children ranging from hearing and eye defects to microcephaly-abnormally small heads-and other severe fetal development brain defects. Reuters reports:The House approved a funding deal that had been agreed to on Wednesday by Republicans from both the House and Senate. But the bill's future was uncertain in the Senate, where the Democratic minority has more power to stop legislation, and Democratic leader Harry Reid has declared his opposition.""It is a responsible plan that assures the administration will continue to have the needed resources to protect the public,"" Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Republicans said the deal included funding for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.For months on end, Democrats and Health officials have urged the GOP to agree on funding the CDC quickly. Instead of providing the funds that the CDC requested, the GOP has decided to rob Peter in order to pay Paul.House Democrats said they could not go along with the deal because of $750 million in budget cuts elsewhere that the Republicans want to use to pay for the Zika spending.Senate Democrats also voiced displeasure, clouding the outlook for it passing.""A narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off women's access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus,"" Reid said.Umea<U+200B> University reports on the Zika threat in Southern Europe. In the United States, the Gulf Coast states are at greatest risk.[2016-06-10] Established Aedes-mosquito population could spread the Zika virus in Europe this summer if infected travelers introduce the virus. An analysis of temperatures, vectorial capacity, basic reproductive number (R0), and air traveler flows suggests parts of Southern Europe may be at risk for Zika outbreaks between June and August. This according to a study, led by Umeå University researchers and published in the journal EBioMedicine.We know warm climates create the kind of conditions suitable for mosquito-borne illnesses to spread,"" says Joacim Rocklöv, researcher at Umeå University's Unit for Epidemiology and Global Health and co-author of the article.""Vectorial capacity depends on a number of parameters but in general, warmer temperatures increase the rate in which the female mosquitos bite, the mosquito virus reproduction, and their virus transmission risk. The presence of established Aedes mosquito populations, the warmer climate and the coinciding peak flow of air travelers into Europe, is a triage making Southern Europe fertile ground for Zika.""Dominican Republic. Image credit: The Government of the Dominican RepublicHealth warnings have been issued from the United Nations urging Zika-affected nations to allow women access to contraception and abortion to deal with the virus's birth defects.First<U+200B><U+200B> Post reports:In November 2015, the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) issued an alert about the Zika virus in Latin America, following which several countries issued health advisory warnings, including urging women to avoid pregnancy.The findings showed that amongs all of the countries that had issued health warnings about Zika, the number of requests for abortion doubled in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuala as well as increased by over a third in most of the other countries.In countries that had issued no health warnings, there was no statistically significant increase.However, in many of these countries, abortion is either illegal or highly restricted, leaving pregnant women with few options and potentially driving women to use unsafe methods, access abortion drugs without medical supervision or visit underground providers, said the paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine","dailykos","left","16975","zika",746
"The beltway bastion of mainstream media liberalism, the Washington Post, has teamed up with the abortion industry to beat up the Catholic Church for its opposition to abortion as a means of addressing the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America.Decrying what it calls the Church's ""entrenched opposition"" to relaxing abortion laws, the Post abandoned all pretense of objectivity in its lengthy screed in support of abortion as a means to tackle the Zika crisis. Nowhere in the nearly 1,500-word article does the Post bother to comment on the numerous problems with this approach, in its zeal to back up the abortion lobby.The article does, of course, trot out Planned Parenthood's fully discredited argument that legislation restricting abortion causes a rise in dangerous, ""back-alley abortions."" As has been shown in the case of the United States, making abortion legal resulted in no perceptible decrease in female mortality due to complications in abortion.Moreover, by this logic, since outlawing terrorism results in the use of dangerous, homemade bombs, states should legalize it and supply them with effective, professional explosives.The Post claims that ""Brazil's government blames the virus for a sharp increase in reports of children born with undersize heads, a condition known as microcephaly,"" without mentioning the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recognized that so far there is no conclusive relation between the two at all.Recent reports suggest, on the contrary, that alleged connections between the Zika virus and microcephaly in Brazilian babies may be due more to hype and hysteria than serious science.Though the Brazil Ministry of Health has registered an unusually high number of babies born with microcephaly, 96% of these cases occurred without the mothers having been infected with the Zika virus at all, which means that the cause must be sought elsewhere.The Post says that Zika cases have been reported in the four Latin American nations where abortion is illegal-Chile, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and El Salvador-but fails to mention that there has been no problem with microcephaly in these countries.Zika has been around for decades, yet up to now has never been found to correlate to birth defects in children. Its effects are so mild and short-lived that 4 out of 5 people infected with the virus do not even realize they are sick. Symptoms include low-grade fever, maybe a rash, possible conjunctivitis (pink eye), and some joint pain.Noting that ""it is extremely difficult for doctors to detect"" microcephaly until it is too late, the Post suggests that all women affected with Zika should be allowed to abort their babies, just in case the child might suffer from any defects, even if it is extremely improbable.""Brazilian activists want women who have been diagnosed with Zika to be able to terminate a pregnancy on that basis alone,"" the Post notes. Yet the article also concedes that in Colombia, ""3,100 pregnant women in the country have tested positive for Zika,"" yet not one case of ""Zika-related microcephaly"" has been found. These babies would have been aborted in vain, out of fear of a condition that didn't exist.Joining in spreading hysteria over ""possible"" effect of Zika to unborn babies, the Post says that a growing concern among pediatricians is that Zika could inflict harm to developing brain tissue in other, less obvious ways than microcephaly.""That condition could be the 'tip of the iceberg' of a series of neurological problems, some of which might not show up in the brain scans used to spot microcephaly,"" the Post says, despite the fact that there is no scientific proof of such a connection, which is pure speculation.The fact that established ties between Zika and microcephaly are circumstantial at this point has not deterred abortion activists like Planned Parenthood from stirring up panic among pregnant women and exploiting the situation to push for relaxing abortion legislation in Latin American countries where it is restricted.Instead of promoting research into remedies to treat or counteract the virus, the abortion industry has shamelessly played into people's worst fears to push for abortion-on-demand in countries like El Salvador that currently restrict or prohibit abortion.The Washington Post is firmly in their corner.Follow Thomas D.

"Brazilian officials, including President Dilma Rousseff, took to the streets on Saturday for National Day Against Zika to raise awareness about the virus and ways to prevent it.The government wrote in a press release:Various politicians across the country made public appearances to raise awareness of Zika prevention techniques, including the elimination of still water pools and wearing long-sleeved clothing. Here, legislator Celina Leão meets her constituents.Translation: Manaus enters the ""war"" against the Aedes mosquito in the National Day of Mobilization Zika Zero.Translation: ""The only vaccine against Zika is citizen awareness today,"" says Minister.Troops passed around fliers to residents with instructions ""to reduce breeding grounds for Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that transmits Zika, dengue fever and a close cousin, chikungunya.""""At least once a week we should take 15 minutes, which isn't much, to see, inspect and clean our homes,"" declared Marcelo Castro, the Brazilian health minister. ""More than two-thirds of the mosquitoes breed inside homes,"" Mr. Castro said. ""The army, navy, air force, military police, fire departments and agents who fight epidemics cannot do this alone.""The officials, with President Rousseff, wore t-shirts that said, ""A mosquito is not stronger than an entire country."" The government wants the communities to combat the mosquitoes, while the residents hoped the officials would do more.""Sometimes the garbage piles up here for days, and it would be nice if they sprayed for mosquitoes once in a while,"" said Joanice Jesus Bispo, who lives near the Atlantic Ocean.In São Luís, Chief Minister of the Civil House Jaques Wagner and Mayor Edivaldo Junior pushed their citizens to do all they can to eliminate the mosquitoes.""I ask everyone to continue to contribute to fight against mosquitoes so we can ensure the health of future generations,"" said Wagner.Doctors in Rio de Janeiro report two cases of Zika every hour. At the end of January, O Globo highlighted the role the Brazilian officials have played in allowing mosquito infestation in many of the nation's urban hubs.Edimilson Migowski, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), claims the ""records of suspected cases account for only 2% of the total number of infected people, which is close to 75,000.""Migowski also blamed the City Council for the disease because officials have not held an Index Survey on the Aedes aegypti mosquito since last October. These surveys track Aedes aegypti mosquitos, which carry the Zika virus. Silvia Cavalcantti, graduate coordinator in Microbiology UFF [Fluminense Federal University], levied the same complaint.""Working with a LIRAa [the survey] is something basic,"" she explained. ""Knowing the most affected areas is essential to promote more intensive actions against epidemics. If the surveys show that an area is at risk, agents can be relocated to minimize the effects.""She added, ""In addition, the work must be done all year. It's no use fighting the vector seasonally.""O Globo also reported the Ministry of Health ""stressed"" that officials continue to gather information about Aedes aegypti, but residents in poor cities like Rocinha and affluent neighborhoods like Alto Leblon have noticed standing water and neglect from state workers.""In the last two years, no one from the city has done mosquito surveys,"" said Ednaldo, who has worked in the neighborhood for 27 years. ""The agents arrive with a piece of paper, sign it, and then do nothing. Previously they put larvicidal powder into the drains and saucers of plants. But there are more. If you do a survey on the street, you will find many mosquito breeding grounds.""Ednaldo also criticized the residents in the neighborhood.""Dwellers in my building let water accumulate in saucers,"" he exclaimed.

"The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) confirmed six travel-related cases of Zika virus in the state, as of late Friday, with four more cases suspected. Public health officials and medical providers are bracing for more cases, worried this could be the tip of the iceberg.On Friday, Houston public health officials confirmed five Zika virus cases. Dr. Brian Arenare, Director of Disease Control and Clinical Prevention for Harris County Public Health and Environmental Sciences, commented on the challenges of formulating a preparedness plan for a virus with limited published scientific data, according to the Houston Chronicle. He said: ""We're faced with, before the bona fide mosquito season actually begins, having this important opportunity to plan what kinds of steps need to be in place now, so that we're as far ahead of the curve as we can be.""So far, all Texans with confirmed cases of Zika contracted the virus abroad and were diagnosed when they returned stateside says the state health agency. However, Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, believes the Texas Gulf Coast could be ""hardest hit"" in a Zika outbreak, he told the Houston newspaper. The virus is carried by same two types of Aedes mosquitoes that carry Dengue fever, prevalent on the Texas-Mexico border, and Chikungunya, which first entered the state in 2014, with more cases last year, Breitbart Texas reported. These mosquitoes like to reproduce in standing water close to humans. Hotez cited Houston's economically depressed areas as prime breeding grounds.In North Texas, Dallas County health officials want to better prepare themselves in case of an outbreak by asking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for approval to locally test in May, the start of mosquito season in the region when the virus could spread. On Jan. 26, Dallas County Health and Human Services Director Zachary Thompson told NBC DFW (KXAS) that the county is ""taking the proactive step of seeking certification of our lab so that we can be able to do the test locally"" and hopes the CDC will approve local testing by May. Presently, Dallas County sends suspect blood samples to Atlanta-based CDC for testing.Dallas last faced a serious health threat in 2014 when a Liberian man, infected with the highly contagious Ebola virus, brought the first case of the deadly illness into the U.S. through Dallas, which Breitbart Texas covered extensively. It spread to two nurses treating the man. He later died, sparking a panic across the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, which remained on edge for months.Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported on Saturday that Bexar County health officials in San Antonio confirmed they tested six people for Zika virus, none of them were pregnant. They await results from the CDC.  The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District does not want Bexar County residents to panic since there are no confirmed cases of native Texas mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus, which, according to Dr. Anil Magla, means that the virus is not spreading locally, and only exists in travel-related cases to affected regions.Dr. Nikos Vasilakis is among the world's leading experts on mosquito-borne illnesses at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston. His team hopes to eventually develop a Zika virus vaccine. Previously, he called Brazil's 3,000-plus cases in 2015 ""the tip of the iceberg."" He told CBS-TV affiliate KHOU 11: ""We need to find a way to control the spread."" Vasilakis fears U.S. government regulations could impede the process of developing a general population vaccine. He told the BBC: ""What would take the longest time would be the process of passing it through the FDA and other regulatory agencies to allow it for public use and that may take up to 10 to 12 years.""Breitbart News reported that medical experts warn the virus has ""explosive"" pandemic potential. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that up to four million cases of Zika may surface before a cure is found. Of greatest concern are pregnant women. Experts suspect a connection between Zika virus and serious birth defects. During Brazil's 2015 Zika virus outbreak, incidences of microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with small heads and abnormally deformed brains, increased. The CDC advised pregnant women to avoid traveling to the 24 countries seeing high rates of the virus in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare paralysis disease, also increased during the 2014 French Polynesia Zika virus outbreak. Wednesday, the CDC suggested that Zika may lead to hearing and vision problems.For now, the best way to combat the virus and avoid an outbreak is to eradicate mosquitoes by removing tires, plastic containers and other refuse from properties that can hold water and where Zika-infected mosquitos can breed, NBC DFW reported. Texas health officials also recommend wearing long sleeves, covering up, and using insect repellent. TDSHS advises to stay and sleep in screened-in or air-conditioned rooms and they encourage people, especially pregnant women, to follow the CDC's travel precautions.TDSHS says that most people exposed to the mosquito-borne illness, experience mild to no symptoms. The signs of the Zika virus are fever, rash, muscle and joint aches and even, pinkeye. on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16830","zika",887
"Pope Francis has weighed in on birth control amidst the Zika virus outbreak in Latin America, suggesting that women could use contraception to prevent a pregnancy. However, the pope stopped short of condoning abortion. ""Avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil,"" Francis said, according to multiple reports. ""In certain cases, as in this one... it was clear. I would also urge doctors to do their utmost to find vaccines against these mosquitoes that carry this disease.""Francis ruled out abortion, however, calling it ""a crime, an absolute evil.""The Catholic church generally opposes contraception. Francis referenced an exception Pope Paul VI made in the 1960s allowing nuns in the Belgian Congo to take birth control pills because they were in danger of being raped. And in 2010, Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict, made waves when he suggested that using condoms might be morally justifiable as a way to prevent the spread of HIV. While mosquitoes are the main mode of transmission for the disease, the Zika virus can remain in semen for an indeterminate amount of time. A handful of case studies in the U.S. suggest that the disease can be transmitted sexually.Because of this, authorities from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that pregnant couples who may have been exposed to Zika use condoms consistently and correctly to make sure the virus is not passed along to the expectant mother.Several countries affected by the epidemic have advised women to delay pregnancy, which may present some difficulty in heavily Catholic areas.Thirty countries and territories have ongoing Zika virus transmission right now. Brazil is home to the largest Zika virus epidemic by far. An estimated 498,000 to 1.5 million Brazilians may have contracted the disease, which is symptomless for most people who get it.Brazil's Zika epidemic, which may have begun as early as 2014, appears to coincide with a spike of microcephaly, in which babies are born with smaller heads than normal. The country's ministry of health reported 4,443 suspected or confirmed cases of microcephaly in Brazil in its last update.Because of Zika's suspected link to microcephaly, as well as a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, the World Health Organization declared the clusters of birth defects potentially linked to the virus a ""public health emergency of international concern"" on Feb. 1.This is a developing story.

"If you thought Florida and Texas were the only states that had to worry about Zika virus this summer, think again. On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its maps showing the territory range for the Zika-capable Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species of mosquito.The agency noted that the Aedes aegypti is more likely to spread viruses such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya than the Aedes albopictus, though the latter is capable of transmission, too. ""There are more places at risk than realize they're at risk, given where the mosquito is likely to be present,"" said CDC director Tom Frieden, according to the Associated Press. Still, the agency's website was careful to note that the maps represent the potential ranges for the mosquitos, not the risk for disease spread.So far, there have been 312 travel-related Zika cases confirmed in the United States, and zero locally acquired cases. Since the virus can also be transmitted sexually, the agency recommends that men who contract Zika virus wait six months before having unprotected sex -- whether vaginal, anal, and oral -- and that pregnant couples with a Zika-infected male partner abstain from sex or use condoms every time.  Most people who contract Zika virus develop very mild symptoms, or don't show any signs of having had the virus at all. But doctors and researchers strongly suspect there's a connection between women who contract Zika during pregnancy and the birth defect microcephaly, which can cause babies to be born with abnormally small heads and in some cases, cognitive problems. It may also cause miscarriage and stillbirth, and women who have traveled to an area with Zika virus are advised to wait eight weeks before trying to get pregnant. In Brazil, where Zika virus has been rapidly spreading since last year, there are 944 confirmed cases of microcephaly at latest count.","huffingtonpost","left","16891","zika",333
"An American biologist took a trip to Senegal to study malaria, and accidentally made ""virological history,"" reports Science magazine, by transmitting an insect-borne virus after having sex with his wife upon return.The biologist, Brian Foy, was collecting mosquitoes as part of the research -- and frequently getting bitten as a result. Foy became sick shortly after returning home to Colorado with the Zika virus -- a virus that causes joint pain, fatigue, and other recognizable symptoms. Days later his wife appeared to have developed the same illness.  (His children, Science rightly points out, were fine.) Foy wrote the whole thing up here, referring to himself as ""patient 1"" and his wife as ""patient 3."" (He later revealed the true identities to Science. Patient 2 was a fellow researcher on the trip.)This discovery marks what's most likely the first known case of sexually transmitted insect-borne disease. Science reports: There is no direct evidence that Foy's wife was infected through sexual contact, but the circumstantial evidence is strong ... As the paper puts it, ""patients 1 and 3 reported having vaginal sexual intercourse in the days after patient 1 returned home but before the onset of his clinical illness."" (""My wife wasn't happy with what happened afterwards,"" Foy adds.)""If sexual transmission could be verified in subsequent studies,"" Foy wrote, ""this would have major implications toward the epidemiology of ZIKV and possibly other arthropodborne flaviviruses.""","huffingtonpost","left","15071","zika",249
"In April, the Obama Administration made a great show of moving $590 million in taxpayer funds from an account to fight Ebola over to an account for fighting the Zika threat. Two months later, the Most Transparent Administration in History has no idea where that money went. Oh, by the way, they need another $1.9 billion for Zika, which they once dismissed as the overhyped obsession of Internet crisis junkies. The Washington Examiner notes that Congress is willing to consider more funding for Zika, but first it wants to know where the previous pile of taxpayer cash went. Administration officials can do nothing but turn their pockets inside out and shrug:House Republicans pointed out the Administration has plenty of funding available from other sources that could be re-purposed for Zika, and yet it's pretending to be flat broke:Rep. Susan Brooks (R-IN) made similar points in a Washington Post editorial on Monday:The last half-billion certainly doesn't seem to have made its way to Zika-threatened southern states like Louisiana, whose officials say it hasn't received any urgently-needed federal assistance.""Slush fund"" is probably a good guess for the fate of the missing $590 million. An awful lot of federal cash has been magically appearing in the hands of liberal special interest groups during the Obama years - a feeding frenzy most clearly visible in the mortgage settlement racket, which basically has banking customers unwittingly subsidizing the National Council of La Raza and the Urban League, with Justice Department lawyers acting as bag men.We live in an age when American voters are tightening their belts to deal with stagnant income and high unemployment, and the private sector workforce is deflating like a punctured balloon but the government can lose track of $590 million in sixty days, and nobody bats an eye. It's just business as usual. Uncle Sam has a really big sofa, and a lot of pocket change just slips between the cushions.Zika is starting to look like one of those crises Chicago's disastrous mayor, Rahm Emanuel, advised Obama not to waste. We wouldn't need billions to control disease-bearing mosquitoes, if environmentalist radicals hadn't banned effective pesticides. With simple solutions off the table, everything becomes so delightfully complicated and expensive!It's fun watching the most overfunded government in the history of mankind pretend to be perpetually broke, lacking the funds to handle any of its basic duties, helpless before each new challenge unless taxpayers fork over a billion dollars pronto but don't you dare criticize the Royal Family for burning millions of dollars in jet fuel on its endless luxury vacations, or second-guess the bureaucracy's decision to raise another paperwork palace on the Potomac. Obama-style government is only broke when it comes to its duties. It has endless lucre available for indulgences, including plump bonuses and eye-popping benefits for even its most manifestly incompetent employees. Federal agencies invest huge resources in mission creep, while claiming to be utterly overwhelmed by their original missions.This President claims that only narrow-minded Republican intransigence keeps him from sprinkling the landscape with Hoover Dams, and filling the sky with Sputnik moments - but ask him to build a border fence, and suddenly such a miracle of technology is an unthinkable achievement his malnourished government couldn't possibly afford. Want the Centers for Disease Control to control a disease? Sorry, citizen, you'll have to pay extra for that.Living under Obama's vision of the Super-State is like buying a luxury vacation package and finding out you have to pay extra for bedsheets and a functioning toilet in the hotel room. It takes a lot of work to pretend a $3.6 trillion government with almost 3 million employees is incapable of meeting any contingency without billions in emergency funding.

"Doctors have found the Zika virus in areas of the body protected from the immune system, such as seminal fluid, fetal brain tissue, and the placenta.""Right now, we know it's in the blood for a very limited period of time, measured in a week to at most 10 days,"" explained Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""We know now, as we accumulate experience, it can be seen in the seminal fluid. We're not exactly sure after the infection clears, where else it would be.""He added, ""These are all things that need to be carefully examined in natural history and case-control studies.""The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently announced that doctors confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly, a rare birth defect.""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC Director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of asserting that Zika causes microcephaly, a disorder in which the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth and results in a small head. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the Zika outbreak, however, Brazil has documented over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.Doctors found 404 cases of microcephaly in newborns since November. They tied seventeen ""to the Zika virus."" Fifteen of the 404 passed away, ""with five linked to Zika."" Authorities are investigating 56 other deaths and 3,670 cases.Reuters reported researchers in Slovenia described ""a severely brain damaged fetus from a mother who was infected in Brazil"" in a paper for the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. The doctors found ""high levels of Zika in the brain and some evidence that the virus had been replicating."" They concluded Zika survived ""because it is an immunologically privileged site.""Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia have advised women against getting pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.The Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) confirmed a person received the virus after ""sexual contact with an individual with Zika.""""Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,"" explained Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director. ""Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any sexually-transmitted infections.""Harvey Stern, medical director at Fairfax Cryobank, told USA Today that scientists do not ""know how long the Zika virus can survive in semen, or whether the virus is present in the semen of men without symptoms.""Last Friday, British researchers reported doctors found the Zika virus in a 68-year-old man 62 days after he contracted the virus.U.S. officials recommended that any man coming from a Zika country use ""condoms even with nonpregnant sex partners because the virus may persist in semen even after it clears the bloodstream.""""They don't say for how long,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. ""That's because they don't know. As it was with Ebola, we're learning as we go.""Brazilian scientists detected live Zika virus in human saliva and urine, which may indicate that a person in contact with these bodily fluids can contract the virus.""I think we need to be careful that don't we [sic] jump to any conclusions about transmissibility,"" said Fauci. ""When you find a virus or fingerprints of a virus in a body secretion, it absolutely does not mean that it is transmitted that way.""Saliva can hold HIV, but it cannot spread the disease.Others said the ""low levels"" can make it ""impossible or unlikely"" to transfer to another person. Substances in the saliva could also prevent transmission.""I think it's important to step back and emphasize that Zika is a mosquito-borne virus and the overwhelming majority of cases are spread by mosquitoes,"" stated Frieden.Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations in the Western Hemisphere have recorded populations of the mosquito species living there. (Chile and Canada are the exceptions.) They also carry dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya. Doctors found Zika in one infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.","breitbart","right","16846","zika",781
"Venezuelan opposition legislator José Manuel Olivares claims the country has under-reported cases of the Zika virus and the country lacks necessary medical supplies to properly combat the outbreak sweeping the region.""I hope that President Nicolas Maduro will not continue putting policy and ideology before the health and life of Venezuelans,"" he declared.Olivares, chair of the Subcommittee on Health in Venezuela's National Assembly, visited Washington to appeal for aid from the World Health Organization (WHO). He said he estimates that between 400,000-500,000 Venezuelans have contracted the Zika virus.""What we did was provide continuity to the declaration of the humanitarian health crisis that the Venezuelan Parliament made,"" he told Infobae. ""This declaration seeks to solve the health crisis in the country, marking a roadmap to seek solutions to the deep crisis of health, lack of medicines, increases in the levels of maternal mortality, cancer mortality, and child mortality.""Venezuela's Pharmaceutical Federation declared a ""humanitarian emergency"" in January, announcing that 150 drugs were completely unavailable nationwide and that some pharmacies had resorted to selling veterinary medications to people as a last resort.On February 12, the government confirmed three deaths related to Zika while also noting an increase in the rare Guillain-Barré syndrome. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said officials only confirmed 319 cases of Zika, but doctors have monitored 5,221 suspected cases since February 8. At that time, doctors documented 21 deaths related to the syndrome.Olivares attacked the government for the lack of transparency.""In its first statement about Zika, the government says it has only 3,000 suspected cases and acknowledges 255 cases of the Guillain-Barré syndrome,"" he said, adding:His statements echo worries within the Venezuelan medical community for the past month. At the end of January, the community demanded officials publish all statistics on the Zika virus. They stopped publishing epidemic lists last year.""The Ministry of Health must be the first to issue warnings about the existence of a public health threat; they cannot be the last one to speak,"" said Jose Oletta, former health minister who now works with the Network to Defend National Epidemiology. ""We already have a weakened health care system, which tends to make these problems spread more rapidly. Add to that the lack of information and it's a perfect storm.""The Venezuelan Society of Public Health claimed surveys from non-governmental organizations discovered ""a rise of acute fever in the past six months that could correspond to 400,000 cases of Zika.""Colombian Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria claimed Venezuela has hidden hundreds of thousands of Zika cases, which could cause major problems for the other South and Central American countries fighting the disease. He insists the socialist country is the weakest link in the fight because officials have ""no systematic reporting of the data."" The lack of data worries Colombian officials because the countries share borders.""This is a serious problem,"" stated Gaviria.The Norte de Santandar province, which shares a border with Venezuela, has the highest amount of Zika cases in Colombia. It also has the largest amount of pregnant women with the virus.China confirmed its first Zika case after a 34-year-old man returned from Venezuela.

"Zika is ""a bit scarier"" than the administration initially thought, officials acknowledged Monday, rattling off a list of alarming discoveries about the mosquito-borne virus that is linked to serious birth defects and debilitating syndromes.The virus not only has been linked to a surge in babies born with abnormally small heads in Latin America, but it also seems to be causing premature births and eye problems in newborns, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The mosquito breed that typically carries Zika has been found to exist in about 30 states, more than twice than previously thought.""The more and more we learn, the more and more you get concerned about the scope of what this virus is doing,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious diseases director at the National Institutes of Health.He said Zika appears to attack the nervous system and stays in the blood of pregnant women and lab monkeys for weeks instead of a matter of days as scientists previously thought.The Zika virus is circulating in Puerto Rico, and local transmission could hit the U.S. mainland within months. As temperatures climb, the climate becomes more hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the primary carrier of the virus.Sizing up the threat, the White House is prodding Congress to approve a $1.9 billion request in emergency funding to fight Zika at home and abroad.Congressional Republicans applauded the administration last week for taking their advice and shifting $510 million left over from the successful fight against Ebola to Zika, though the White House says it still wants money to combat Zika.""It is not enough for us to get the job done. It is just a temporary stopgap,"" Dr. Fauci said.Without new funding, he said, ""we're going to have to start raiding other accounts.""Dr. Fauci said other research at his agency will suffer if that occurs.Appropriators insist that they are monitoring the problem and are ready to act if needed. They said any additional funds to address the crisis should be provided through the normal appropriations process.The CDC has reported 346 travel-related cases of Zika in the states and the District of Columbia. U.S. territories have recorded 351 locally acquired cases, mostly in Puerto Rico.Administration officials say states such as Texas and Florida will be on the front lines of local transmission this summer.Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who dropped out of the presidential race, said last week he could support Mr. Obama's funding request as long as the money is dedicated to Zika alone.""The most important thing I can do to help get the support of my party, to support this initiative, is to be able to go back to them and say, 'Not only is this money going to be spent wisely, it's going to be spent only on this. It's not going to be a gravy train for all sorts of other initiatives that have nothing to do with Zika,'"" Mr. Rubio said after a meeting on Zika last week with state, local and Puerto Rican officials.Meanwhile, the CDC is urging travelers who return from the hot zone to try to avoid mosquitoes in the U.S. so they don't set off local outbreaks.""We really want the traveling public, when they come back from the Caribbean or Latin America, to use repellent for the couple of weeks after they return,"" Dr. Schuchat said. ""Because if they silently got Zika infection and they get bit by a mosquito in the continental U.S., that mosquito can then spread the virus.""Dr. Schuchat said the CDC doesn't expect large outbreaks in the states, based on its experience with similar viruses, though it isn't taking any chances.The CDC says pregnant women should defer travel to Brazil and other areas where Zika is spreading. It also cautioned men returning from affected countries to use condoms with their partners because Zika can be spread sexually.Administration officials said they have shared this advice with the U.S. Olympic Committee ahead of the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. ","washingtontimes","right","16902","zika",687
"It's not the kind of buzz you want to hear when you're pregnant. But now that the Zika virus has been declared a global public health emergency, you have to cancel your babymoon or at least rethink that tropical destination. The good news is these relaxing and romantic places offer a refreshing alternative to the typical bump-on-a-beach scenario. Here are seven babymoon getaways that are sure to stun--not sting. Hidden away on Isola delle Rose, the JW Marriott Venice is one of those rare vacations within a vacation. Situated a quick complimentary boat ride from St. Marks Square, this new hotel, designed by eco architect star Matteo Thun, makes it easy for guests to savor Venice up close and from a quiet distance--be it from the rooftop pool, the GOCO spa, at breakfast, or in La Residenze Pool de Luxe room. When you're not roaming the 40-acre private island, amidst orchards, vegetable gardens and an olive grove, go to the market with Chef Mauro Taufer to pick out the day's catch then learn to cook an authentic Venetian dish, take a Murano glass workshop, and unwind with an 80-minute prenatal massage (with or without an accompanying violinist). From $330/night.The next best thing to a beach getaway looks like this. Situated just a five-minute bike ride from town on the hotel's cruiser, Solage Calistoga contains 89 modernly appointed guest studios tucked away on a quiet road surrounded by vineyards. This health and wellness sanctuary rarely feels like anything but a romantic retreat for two as you meander the 22-acre property, featuring enough scattered geothermal pools, hot tubs and cabanas--not to mention your own private patio--for you to relax in peace, nothing to hear but the wind rustling the palm trees. However you spend the day, with a signature 60-minute mudslide treatment ($110), spin class, power yoga, guided hike or Strong of Heart couples session with Dr. Tim Carl, end it with dinner at Michelin-rated Solbar, where the winter vegetable chopped salad and pan-roasted Mary's chicken pairs well with mocktails like Sexy Lemonade (a non-alcoholic riff on their Sex in the Valley) or a virgin Orchard Frost, which goes down like a crisp walk through an apple orchard. Rooms from $395/night. Stepping inside the 1909 mansion, nestled in Newport's charming Historic Hill neighborhood, is an instant escape from time and the all-too-real realities that come with it. At the Vanderbilt Grace, your babymoon might start with lemon poppy buttermilk pancakes in the sun-drenched Conservatory, followed by the mommy-to-be massage treatment ($125) and a soak in the indoor or outdoor heated pools. After exploring nearby Thames Street and the bustling harbor, take a Newport Mansion tour with the ""Quintessential Newport"" package ($522) that includes a two-night stay and admission to museums like The Breakers, The Elms and Rosecliff. Don't miss a meal at Muse, where the preggo-friendly menu (and dishes such as sole with braised artichokes and flexible milk chocolate with popcorn ice cream, peanut brittle and peanut butter truffles) will make you forget all about lamenting those strict dietary rules. Rooms from $285/night.Whether the scenery is snow-white or blazoned with yellow birches and red sugar maples, Whiteface Lodge is a reliably serene escape of rustic luxury set deep within six million acres of forestland in the Adirondacks. Book the babymoon package (from $375/night), which includes overnight accommodations in a junior suite, breakfast, a pedicure and a 50-minute pre-natal massage. In addition to providing complimentary shuttle service to the town two miles away, the resort offers guests the summertime pleasures of The Canoe Club down the road on Lake Placid, where a private beach, lunch fare, and various boating activities are available. Evening on-site diversions range from a s'mores fire pit to a movie theater to live jazz and an outdoor heated pool, where you just might float forever in a steamy cloud under the bright starry sky.Idyllically situated in the Swiss Alps for the last 102 years, the Gstaad Palace is as breathtaking to look at as the mountains that surround it. The town's ""Come Up, Slow Down"" mantra is carried inside the hotel, where its international reputation as an exclusive party-hard hideaway betrays its true nature as a relaxing and reasonably priced retreat for those who like to feel they've disappeared from reality for a little while. While there are plenty of glamorous guests in the lobby bar to spy on over the rim of your mocktail--ask top barman Mario Guzzetti to fix you a virgin Moscow Mule: crushed ice in a cold copper cup, juice of one fresh lemon, ginger beer, slice of cucumber--the real highlights are waking up to a skyline of snow-covered peaks, a full body pre-natal massage and soaking in the spa's outdoor heated pool, lunch atop Wasserngrat mountain, a pasteurized fondue feast at La Fromagerie, and meringues at Early Beck pastry shop in town, easily accessible by the palace's complimentary shuttle. From $495 in winter, $414 in summer. Rates include breakfast and lunch or dinner, with a credit of $110 pp.Despite the name, Mama Shelter isn't the most obvious choice for a babymoon. There's no spa or room service, but this Right Bank abode is a 20th Arrondissement gem for mama-to-be's seeking a peaceful offbeat escape in Paris. After a delicious breakfast of eggs, sausage and crêpe Suzette, explore nearby Père-Lachaise Cemetery, where Oscar Wilde and Jim Morrison are buried and new mothers can be found pushing strollers. While the quirky Philippe-Starck designed hotel is four miles from the center of town on the No. 76 bus (that stops in front of the hotel en route to the Louvre) you may find you prefer to lounge the day away on the cozy rooftop until your homemade, fresh-from-the-market dinner is served on outdoor communal tables. Rooms come with masks like Scooby Doo, Batman and Darth Vader, and range from small mama ($98) to the terrace-equipped XL mama ($329). Perched on a 120-acre wooded estate, this Green Mountain haven lives up to its name. A four-diamond property, Topnotch Resort is located three miles from Stowe village, which is easily reached by the hotel shuttle. There are myriad nearby outdoor activities, from hiking the beautiful two-mile trail in Wiessner Woods to kayaking at Waterbury Reservoir and Lake Champlain, but the best place to truly exhale is poolside in an Adirondack chair with 360-degree views of Vermont's wide-open grandeur. The babymoon getaway (from $434/night) includes two nights of accommodations, a 50-minute couples massage, daily breakfast, a locavore feast at Flannel restaurant, and a special delivery of pickles, cheese, crackers, nuts and cookies for midnight cravings.For more getaway ideas, follow Lauren on Twitter and Instagram.Photos: Courtesy of Solage Calistoga, Vanerbilt Grace, Whiteface Lodge, Gstaad Palace, Topnotch Resort, Martin Martinsson, JW Marriott Venice","huffingtonpost","left","16874","zika",1226
"Last week I published a post praising the Pope for encouraging a more moderate stance about contraception and allowing the use of birth control to prevent pregnancy in areas of the world where the Zika virus has taken hold. The 'thing' that story was missing was an actual representation of what that would look like - would there be church leaders strategically stationed on the corners of poor neighborhoods in Brazil passing out contraception? Immediate action is necessary, but by the time the church is done arguing over the Pope's controversial statements, huge numbers of women worldwide will have become pregnant while infected with the Zika virus.So, how about that real world example I mentioned? Pay close attention to the work of a non-profit organization called DKT International, one of the largest private providers of family planning and reproductive health services worldwide. In a news release distributed on March 1, DKT announced that the organization is passing out free contraception and providing Zika education and awareness in the regions of the world most affected by Zika,""Thousands of DKT employees are working in-the-trenches to inform, educate, and provide contraceptives to those living in even the most remote regions of the world to help prevent the Zika virus, unwanted pregnancies, maternal deaths and unsafe abortions,"" said Chris Purdy, CEO of DKT International. ""As access to digital and mobile technology and social media becomes more prevalent in the developing world, we now have efficient ways to reach rural, underserved, and generally hard-to-reach populations.""DKT health initiatives related to the Zika virus are currently taking place around the world in an effort to educate citizens and provide access to contraceptives, and include: The current Zika outbreak emerged in Brazil and is now exploding across Latin America and the Caribbean. The virus is reportedly responsible for a huge increase in microcephaly, a congenital condition that causes devastating birth defects in which babies' brains do not develop normally. Severe microcephaly causes children to be born with very small heads and brains and can cause a range of other health problems depending on the severity of the microcephaly. Problems these children face can include seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, feeding problems, hearing loss, and vision problems. A case emerged in Texas recently that pointed towards the virus' spread through sexual contact, which may have prompted the Pope to respond to an immediate need for prevention through contraception. Even thought the main culprit for Zika appears to be the mosquito, the idea of delaying pregnancy through contraception seems critical in areas where the virus is progressing (along with Dengue and Yellow Fever), particularly in areas where there are large amounts of standing water, largely a result of a recent El Nino event that brought massive downpours to Brazil. According to Purdy, ""the ability to communicate broadly with large numbers of people about the dangers of Zika and the importance of using condoms and where to get them has the power to significantly change the current reproductive health landscape.""I think what DKT is doing right now is to put into action a practical and realistic response to Zika while others are arguing about ideology. It seems that the Pope might welcome DKT's assistance, as this is quickly becoming a worldwide fight against the virus.","huffingtonpost","left","16867","zika",574
"In testimony during a Senate hearing, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stresses that it is ""too soon"" to advise women about birth defects that may be linked to the Zika virus because little is still known about the virus' effects on an unborn child.""You know we're really at the beginning of understanding Zika in pregnancy,"" Rear Adm. Anne Schuchat, M.D. emphasized in her testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, continuing:""We don't know that a child is going to be born with microcephaly until the child is born - the delivery?"" Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE) asked.""The clinicians will do serial ultrasounds to see whether it looks like the brain is developing okay or whether there are calcifications or some other warning signs, and we don't have a big enough experience to know how predictive the findings are,"" Schuchat responded.She added:Schuchat's testimony comes as Planned Parenthood claims its abortion business is best suited to battle the Zika virus with birth control to prevent pregnancy and abortion.""We are the front line of defense when it comes to battling Zika,"" Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said Thursday, criticizing Republicans who refused to provide additional funding to the abortion giant in a bill to help combat Zika.Laguens said it was ""shameful"" for Republicans ""to undermine the ability of family planning providers like Planned Parenthood to do what we do best in the midst of this rapidly spreading Zika virus, a public health crisis that directly targets women and children.""As Breitbart News has reported, Planned Parenthood has been taking advantage of fears surrounding the Zika virus and the birth defect known as microcephaly that has been linked with the virus. The abortion giant is particularly targeting Latin American countries that have restrictive abortion laws, in hopes of capitalizing on women's fears and changing those laws.However Col. Christopher Zahn, M.D., vice president of practice activities for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), also testified at the Senate hearing and agreed largely with Schuchat:Zahn said the situation ""really becomes challenging, because we don't have a confirmatory test to know if the fetus is going to be clearly affected and to what degree, the ultrasounds add time.""""You can imagine the psychological stress that that creates and the anxiety, so it's really unfortunate that again even with the testing that we do have knowing whether or not the fetus will be affected and to what degree is very challenging,"" Zahn explained.According to the Senate committee:Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently explained that during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil successfully eliminated the mosquito carrying the Zika virus through the use of DDT.In a piece at Sunshine State News, Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) writes:Despite their expressed concern about the spread of Zika, Democrats rejected a bill that would end a redundant Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permit requirement to spray federally approved pesticides into bodies of water to combat the mosquito that carries the Zika virus.","breitbart","right","16987","zika",542
"ATLANTA (AP) - The government urged health officials around the country Friday to get ready now in case there are outbreaks of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in the U.S. this summer.A Zika epidemic has been sweeping through Latin America and the Caribbean, and officials think it's likely some small clusters of Zika will occur in the U.S. when mosquito numbers boom.At a ""Zika Summit"" on Friday, experts prodded some 300 state and local officials gathered at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters to make Zika response plans now.When West Nile virus - transmitted by a different mosquito - moved through the U.S. about 15 years ago, health officials were caught flat-footed, noted Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.""This is an opportunity to get ahead of the curve,"" he told the summit's attendees.The Zika virus causes only a mild and brief illness, at worst, in most people. But in the last year, infections in pregnant women have been strongly linked to fetal deaths and to potentially devastating birth defects, mostly in Brazil.The virus is spread mainly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which also live in parts of the U.S. It was thought to be mainly in the South but the CDC revised its map this week, showing the mosquito has been found in parts of the Midwest and Northeast.Officials don't expect Zika to be a big problem, though, in the U.S. for a number of reasons, including the widespread use of air conditioning and screens. The Zika mosquito likes to bite indoors. They think the clusters may be small and surface only in a few states - most likely Florida and Texas. But they don't know for sure.So far, there have been no Zika infections in the U.S. caught from mosquitoes. More than 300 illnesses have been reported, all linked to travel to Zika outbreak regions.About 350 additional cases have been reported in U.S. territories, most of them in Puerto Rico, where mosquitoes are already spreading the virus. Together, dozens or even hundreds of births in the 50 states and territories could be affected in devastating ways by Zika, said Dr. Edward McCabe of the March of Dimes, who spoke at the summit.""We have a few short weeks to stop the Zika virus from gaining a foothold,"" McCabe said.During the summit, state and local officials were encouraged to map where the Zika mosquito lives and breeds in the state and which insecticides would work best in their area.The Zika response will likely mean workers will go door to door, sometimes asking to go on properties and even spray. That's different from the truck- and aerial-spraying seen in conventional mosquito eradication efforts.It will be a kind of campaign not seen in this country since efforts to wipe out yellow fever in the 1950s and 1960s, and it will take different kinds of equipment, approaches and more staff, CDC officials said.Local health officials at the summit said the work ahead is daunting, especially since it's not clear where they're going to get the money. And health departments are already struggling financially, said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a Seattle-based county public health official who was at the meeting representing the Infectious Diseases Society of America.""Our priority is to make sure we have enough resources to meet the threat,"" Duchin said.Paul Ettestad, New Mexico's public health veterinarian, said some of the state's counties only have a handful of people doing mosquito control work - the same people who also handle snow removal in the winter""They don't have much,"" Ettestad saidThe Obama administration in February requested nearly $2 billion in emergency funding for Zika response work. Congressional leaders have not formally voted on the request.One of the things money is needed for, officials said, is better and faster blood tests for Zika. Now, it takes between a few days to a week to get results.If Zika starts spreading in the U.S, women of childbearing age are going to be ""intensely concerned,"" predicted Dr. Bill Foege, a former CDC director and expert on global health. ""They're going to want to know if they are infected and they're not going to want to wait a week.""","breitbart","right","16892","zika",710
"Just two months after running as one of the conservative candidates in the GOP presidential race, Sen. Marco Rubio is now embracing Democrats' calls to open the federal checkbook and dole out billions of dollars in money to combat the Zika virus - and tacking it onto the debt.Mr. Rubio, whose home state of Florida is at risk of a serious outbreak, is co-sponsoring legislation to fully fund President Obama's nearly $2 billion emergency spending request, and blasted his fellow Republicans for being too stingy by demanding more proof and more controls.And Mr. Rubio, who is finishing out his first term then ditching the Senate at the end of this year, said if the new spending can be offset, that's fine. But he's also fine with tacking it onto the debt and leaving it for others to pay for.""In times of public health emergencies, just like natural disasters, we shouldn't delay acting while we figure out and try to agree on what we're going to cut from other parts of the budget,"" he said in a floor speech last week.Mr. Rubio gives Democrats political cover as Congress prepares to fight this week over the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which health experts say hasn't had a breakout in the U.S. yet, but fear one is looming as the summer heats up.The House GOP released its own plan Monday that would allocate $622 million toward Zika, taking the money from existing Ebola money and elsewhere.                                                                    SEE ALSO: Nancy Pelosi: Emerging Senate deal on Zika money is 'completely inadequate'                                            Senate negotiators, meanwhile, have reached the outlines of a $1.1 billion plan - a little more than half of Mr. Obama's $1.9 billion request - without finding any cuts to offset it elsewhere. Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, has his own alternative that takes money from an Obamacare prevention fund to pay for the new spending.Democrats are likely to oppose that, and then the pressure will be on Republicans to either cave and spend the money without offsets, or to hold firm.Mr. Rubio's vote will be closely watched.""They say all politics is local, but parochialism is not excuse for reckless spending,"" Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler said. ""It is possible to address these things in a fiscally response manner. In this particular case, more than $2 billion in Ebola money remains that can be used to fight the Zika virus. There is no excuse for not using existing funds.""Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said vulnerable states can raise their own funding to combat the threat.""Senator Rubio's inclination to deficit-spend for his home state illustrates why we have a half trillion dollar deficit - self-interest nearly always trumps restraint when it comes to the budget,"" he said.Mr. Rubio is reaching for new spending just two months after he was bounced from the Republican presidential race by businessman Donald Trump. On the campaign trail, Mr. Rubio said the American dream is dying due to Mr. Obama's economic policies, and ""because Congress has spent us into unprecedented debt.""""Make no mistake: if we change nothing, we are going to have a debt crisis in this country,"" he said during a January speech in Sarasota, Florida. ""It is going to destroy jobs. It is going to disrupt the function of our government.""Now, Mr. Rubio is sponsoring three different proposals - his $1.9 billion request, the bipartisan $1.1 billion plan and the Cornyn plan that contains offsets.Rep. Vern Buchanan, another Florida Republican, last week became the first member of the House GOP to back Mr. Obama's request, and Gov. Rick Scott personally lobbied for funding on Capitol Hill in meetings last week, without publicly naming a dollar figure.""Sometimes the needs of one's home state weigh more heavily on members than their party's position,"" said Molly E. Reynolds, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.Also, she said, ""the fact that Rubio is not running for re-election might also play a role here - because he won't be in office after November, he may not feel as compelled to hew to the GOP party line."" ","washingtontimes","right","16937","zika",696
"Mother in Brazil holds child born with microcephaly.Now that they've blown through weeks by doing standard Republican science shuffle-why, we just don't know enough!-the Senate is finally getting close to providing some funds to research and prevent Zika.After a three-month delay, the Senate is acting on President Barack Obama's request for money to combat the Zika virus.The Senate is slated to vote Tuesday on three competing plans to battle the virus, with a bipartisan plan that cuts Obama's $1.9 billion request to $1.1 billion having the greatest chance to advance. The procedural vote would pave the way to add funds for the government's response to Zika to an unrelated spending bill.While the GOP fiddlers' chorus has been rosining up their instruments, the number of travel-related cases in the U.S. have topped 500. But that's not the worst of it. Confirmed local cases in the mainland are probably still a few weeks off, but Zika is spreading quickly in U.S. territories, with more than 700 locally-acquired cases. Of the identified cases, 65 are pregnant women. So it's tragic, but not surprising, that we're seeing this news.Puerto Rican health officials said Friday they had confirmed the territory's first case of microcephaly caused by the Zika virus ...Zika's known to cause a range of birth defects, including devastating brain damage that results in a smaller-than-normal head, a condition known medically as microcephaly. It also causes paralyzing conditions such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and it killed one Puerto Rican man who died from bleeding.It's not clear whether the mother in Puerto Rico had an abortion. Abortions are very limited in Puerto Rico-a fact that may only deepen the tragedy of this disease.","dailykos","left","16938","zika",287
"For weeks now, Congress has either been ignoring requests for funding on Zika, or dragging their feet while the risk keeps growing. Republicans have been using stalling tactics, always claiming to need more information no matter how many reports stack up. Now Democrats have had enough.The political battle over Zika funding intensified Tuesday as congressional Democrats and the White House amped up pressure on Republicans to pass money aimed at combating the dangerous virus that is spreading north to the United States.The birth defects caused by Zika are terrible. It's also terrible that trying to halt the spread of this disease is a ""political battle."" Truthfully, we were already at the ""will kill people to keep Obama from reaching policy goals"" stage way back at the beginning of the healthcare fight. This round just seems more obvious.""This is an emergency if there ever were an emergency,"" said Harry Reid who blamed GOP senators for a ""continual pattern of constant Republican gridlock"" that the Senate minority leader said was blocking swift passage of the money. ...""We cannot wait to act.

"By Timothy Gardner and Jeff MasonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top health officials expressed heightened concern on Monday about the threat posed to the United States by the Zika virus, saying the mosquito that spreads it is now present in about 30 states and hundreds of thousands of infections could appear in Puerto Rico.At a White House briefing, they stepped up pressure on the Republican-led Congress to pass approximately $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Zika preparedness that the Obama administration requested in February.""Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, a deputy director at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""And so while we absolutely hope we don't see widespread local transmission in the continental U.S., we need the states to be ready for that,"" Schuchat added.Zika, linked to numerous cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, is spreading rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean.The White House said last week in the absence of the emergency funds it will redirect $589 million, mostly from money already provided by Congress to tackle the Ebola virus, to prepare forZika before it begins to emerge in the continental United States as the weather warms.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said if Congress does not provide emergency Zika funding, U.S. officials likely would be forced to redirect money currently dedicated for research into malaria, tuberculosis and a universal flu vaccine.""I don't have what I need right now,"" Fauci said.Hopefully the funding crimp will never reach a point where the stopgap money runs out, but if it does, he said, ""we'll have to start raiding other accounts, and very important research in other diseases is going to suffer, and suffer badly.""Schuchat said Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species that primarily transmits the virus, is present in about 30 states, rather than 12 as previously thought. In the U.S. territory Puerto Rico, there may be hundreds of thousands of Zika infections and perhaps hundreds of affected babies, she added.Fauci said it appears the first Zika vaccine candidate is on target to enter initial clinical trials in September.Schuchat declined to forecast the number of Zika infections that could occur in the United States. While she said she did not expect large outbreaks in the continental United States, ""we can't assume we're not going to have a big problem.""Schuchat said Zika is likely to be a problem during much of a pregnancy, not just not just during the first trimester as previously believed.As Brazil prepares to host the Olympic games in August, the CDC has recommended that pregnant women avoid traveling to the country.""We also want people to know that travel to the area may lead to 'silent' infections or infections with symptoms, and that following infections, it's very important to take precautions during sex not to spread the virus,"" Schuchat said.The World Health Organization has said there is a strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with small heads that can result in developmental problems, as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis, though proof may take months or years.Brazil said last week it has confirmed more than 1,046 cases of microcephaly, and considers most to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.(Reporting by Timothy Gardner, Jeff Mason and Clarece Polk; Editing by Will Dunham)","huffingtonpost","left","16902","zika",612
"HOUSTON, Texas - Health professionals from just one clinic in Houston are saying they are screening about 300 pregnant women per day for the Zika virus. About half of these women are from countries where the Zika virus has been prevalent.Dr. Natalie Vanek from the Legacy Community Health clinic told the CBS affiliate in Houston, ""We have a lot of patients that come back and forth from these endemic areas, so we feel it's something that we need to do for our patients."" Vanek is an infectious disease specialist.Dr. Vanek also said, ""If there's a concern, we're going to have their blood sent to the CDC for testing and I'm sure OB doctors will be doing frequent ultrasounds on these women.""Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sending the clinic blood tests, and the clinic is examining the women for rashes, aches, or fever.As reported by Breitbart Texas, health officials say that the danger for contacting the virus is for those who travel to, or are from, Central American and Latin American countries. The virus is extremely dangerous for the unborn babies of pregnant women.A Brazilian judge has approved abortions for women who have contacted Zika and can prove their unborn has microcephaly or ancenephaly, as reported by Breitbart Texas. In Brazil, abortions are only legal with judicial approval.Brazil has launched a door-to-door campaign and are using 220,000 soldiers to combat the spread of the virus, as reported by Breitbart News. The medical field has recorded more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly in the nation.The Zika virus spreads through mosquito bites, in particular from the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The insect also carries diseases such as yellow fever, Chikungunya, and dengue fever.Breitbart News reported that Brazilian authorities have documented thousands of cases of pregnant women diagnosed with Zika giving birth to babies with microcephaly. Children with microcephaly typically suffer severe mental damage.The ""microcephaly epidemic"" is reported to affect at least 20 Brazilian states or more and the federal district. Ancenephaly is a condition in which a fetus is missing a portion of the brain, skull, or scalp. Microcephaly is defined as an abnormal smallness of the head, a congenital condition associated with incomplete brain development.As reported by Breitbart News, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned last week that the Zika virus in Latin America has ""explosive pandemic potential.""

"Associated with grave birth defects, the Zika virus tearing across Latin America could eventually affect more than half of the world's population. That's according to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine which agreed to an interview via email. Although the current epidemic in the Americas is being spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, according to Jimmy Whitworth, the School's Professor of International Public Health: ""A number of mosquitos have been documented to carry the Zika virus. For example, the Aedes albopictus mosquito which resides in large parts of the U.S., southern Europe, and Asia is of particular concern because it's a competent vector for the virus.""It could therefore create large ""outbreaks in the future.""His thoughts are echoed by the Pan American Health Organization, which expects the disease to spread ""everywhere the mosquito is.""And, considering that Zika may have only arrived in Brazil 18 months ago via a single infected traveler who was bitten by a local mosquito, its capacity to spread at lighrening speed is quite alarming.It has since exploded across 23 countries in the Americas. ""In the right conditions, with sufficient mosquitoes and closely packed humans, the virus can spread rapidly. Aedes aegypti, the main vector of Zika, is a domestic mosquito that can breed in any small deposit of water,"" says Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases at the School.Climate change may have stoked the flames of this epidemic. After all, it started during the hottest year on record, and warmer temperatures dramatically speed up the breeding cycle of mosquitos. That means that they breed more, bite more and spread more disease. And, according to Dr Laith Yakob, the school's Lecturer in Disease Vector Biology, temperature plays a key role: ""There is some concern that the albopictus mosquito may spread the disease further because of its ability to thrive in more temperate climes. But, it is important to note that although some of the more temperate regions may well be permissive to mosquito survival, they may not be to the propagation of the virus itself. More research is required.""Like so many viruses such as Aids, Ebola, and Yellow fever, Zika originated in Africa.Named after Uganda's Zika forest where it was first discovered in 1947, it did not cause any major outbreaks in humans until a few years ago in Polynesia.Although the virus itself is of little concern, causing mild to non-existent symptoms such as a rash, itchy skin and red eyes, it wreaks havoc in pregnant women.The virus attacks the brain of the foetus, creating babies with microcephaly - a very small underdeveloped head - and neurological problems.And, even though there is no absolute proof that Zika is behind the recent surge in these birth defects, and outbreaks of Guillain-Barré syndrome, an auto-immune disease which causes temporary life threatening paralysis, the world's leading health authorities are close to certain that it is.In fact, according to Whitworth, ""few scientists doubt the link"". Accordingly, he asserts that the ""more important questions now are: how strong is the link, and are they any co-factors involved.""According to the latest W.H.O. report, Brazil normally has an average of about 160 cases of microcephaly every year. But over the past year, there have been well over 2,700 documented cases. For more definitive proof, scientists are waiting for a large study of 5,000 pregnant women in Colombia to yield results. According to the WHO, the epidemic peaked in Colombia in early February, and most of those women are due to give birth over the next 2 months. ""Although there is a strong scientific consensus that Zika causes microcephaly and other neurological defects, the risk to women is less clear"" says Whitworth.Citing a recent study in French Polynesia,  he says that the risk of the defect is about one in every 100 women infected with Zika during the first trimester"", though concedes that ""more research is needed."" A report in the Lancet  concluded that first-trimester infections were the most dire. But, in a smaller Rio de Janeiro study, even two fetuses which became infected at the later stages of pregnancy suddenly died upon contracting the virus. Whitworth therefore concludes that the virus poses a risk to all pregnant women, regardless of trimester. Moreover, ""until recently it was thought that the only way Zika was transmitted was via mosquito bites. But, there are now reports of a small number of cases being transmitted sexually.  So far, all reports are all of transmission from men to women"" says Whitworth. And, it's not only pregnant women and couples looking to conceive who need to worry about the virus: ""As with microcephaly, the evidence that Zika can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome is mounting all the time"" says Whitworth.GBS causes temporary paralysis which requires hospitalization as the patient requires life support in order to keep breathing. Whitworth says:""A recent study looking at the outbreak of Zika in French Polynesia estimated that 24 out of 100,000 people infected with Zika would develop GBS. If the link is proven, anyone living in, or travelling to, a country where Zika is present is at risk. But, thankfully it seems that the risk is very very small.""According to Whitworth, as Zika is only a mild disease, ""the focus should be on preventing microcephaly in babies"", not on preventing the disease itself.And, as is the cases with most viruses, once infected scientists strongly suspect that one becomes immune, but ""the jury is out on how long that immunity lasts,"" says Whitworth. In a bid to be cautious, US health authorities advise infected women not to conceive for at least 2 months after contracting the virus, and men to abstain for at least 6 months as the virus stays in semen for longer. ""Pregnant women, or women wanting to get pregnant, should heed Public Health messages which include not travelling to areas with active Zika transmission unless it's essential,"" says Whitworth as there is currently no drug nor vaccine to tackle the virus. Although the WHO has declared Zika an international public health emergency,  there are no experimental treatments or vaccines in the pipeline that could be fast-tracked as was the case for Ebola.Sanofi, the French drugs giant, is close to launching the world's first vaccine for dengue, and is ""reviewing the possibility"" of applying it to Zika. But, it has warned that ""there are too many unknowns"" to predict how long it would take.The WHO says that there is some research into a potential Zika vaccine which they hope to accelerate. But it will take at least ""12 months-plus"" before a vaccine was possible.","huffingtonpost","left","16902","zika",1135
"A study of Zika infections in Colombia has found no obvious birth defects among women infected during the third trimester of pregnancy, raising hopes that Zika may not cause serious harm to the fetus when mothers are infected later in pregnancy.""It's somewhat reassuring that it looks like third-trimester infections aren't posing a major risk of that very serious outcome,"" said Dr. Margaret Honein, chief of the birth defects branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who was one of several authors of the study published online on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.She stressed that the findings are preliminary, saying ""it is critically important"" to continue following these babies to look for other effects from exposure to Zika.Honein said the infants in Colombia need to be watched for other potential effects of Zika infection, such as hearing loss or vision problems, or any other developmental problems.The mosquito-borne Zika virus has been shown to attack fetal brain cells and cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains.In Brazil, authorities have confirmed more than 1,400 cases of microcephaly in babies whose mothers were exposed to Zika during pregnancy. Researchers have been closely watching for the same issues among infants in Colombia. The virus arrived in Colombia in October 2015, about five months after the start of Brazil's outbreak.The Colombian study involved data on 65,726 Zika cases reported between Aug. 9, 2015 and April 2, 2016. These included 1,850 pregnant women in which the researchers knew the trimester in which the mother became infected.Of the 600 women infected during their third trimester, 90 percent have delivered their babies, and none gave birth to a child with microcephaly or other obvious birth defects.As of early April, most pregnancies in which women were infected in the first or second trimester were still ongoing, but some of those mothers have started to give birth. In these women, Honein said, there have been ""a growing number"" of problems.""I think the numbers are going to come up,"" said Honein, who expects increasing reports of microcephaly, brain anomalies and other birth defects among women infected with Zika earlier in their pregnancies.CDC investigators are working with their Colombian colleagues to determine which cases are due to Zika and which are due to another cause. (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Tom Brown)","huffingtonpost","left","16968","zika",418
"Senate Democrats are blocking a $1.1 billion Republican measure that would fund efforts to fight the Zika virus because it does not contain funding for Planned Parenthood.Through its alliance with the Democrat Party and the pro-abortion mainstream media, Planned Parenthood has promoted the notion that its biggest money-makers - abortion and birth control - are the means to combat the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which is being linked to cases of a rare birth defect called microcephaly, primarily in Brazil.""They restrict funding for birth control provided by Planned Parenthood. Can you believe that?"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said, according to CNN. ""And the Zika problem, who does it affect? Women and especially pregnant women.""""The bill passed by House Republicans doesn't recognize Zika as a public health emergency,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), reports Roll Call. ""It nickels and dimes our efforts to respond. It makes it more difficult for women to access birth control. And it waives safety rules for the use of pesticides.""Planned Parenthood is currently under investigation by a specially convened panel following a series of undercover videos that exposed the abortion business' apparent practices of harvesting the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics for sale and altering the position of babies during abortion in order to harvest their most intact organs.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, currently there are 819 cases of Zika in the United States associated with travel to infected countries.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), explained recently that during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil successfully eliminated the mosquito carrying the Zika virus through the use of DDT.Fauci said that Brazil was able to stop the spread of Zika through ""a very aggressive attempt"" to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus and is ""a very difficult mosquito to control and eliminate.""""It will require a very aggressive, concerted effort,"" he added.Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), writes at Sunshine State News that babies born with microcephaly ""are being used to promote political causes: legalization of abortion in Latin America, or the fight against 'climate change.'""She explains:""Instead of waiting for some future vaccine against a virus that may prove innocent, we could stop transmission now with effective mosquito control in affected areas,"" Orient urges.The Republican measure would take $750 million from other health programs to fund anti-Zika efforts. In addition, the bill would cut $543 million in unused funds from Obamacare, $107 million from unused funds to combat Ebola, and $100 million in administrative funds from the Department of Health and Human Services.Despite their expressed concern about the spread of Zika, Democrats rejected a bill that would end a redundant Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permit requirement to spray federally approved pesticides into bodies of water to combat the mosquito that carries the Zika virus.Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) said that there would be no negotiating another Zika bill if the legislation did not pass Tuesday, reports USA Today. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), however, said GOP leaders would ultimately relent and renegotiate.""Republicans will come back in a few weeks with their tails between their legs,"" Schumer said.

"By: Rachael Rettner and Karen Rowan Published: 03/05/2016 02:00 PM EST on LiveSciencePregnant women who become infected with Zika virus may be at risk for not only having a child with microcephaly, but also having a fetus with other serious health issues, including problems with the nervous system and even fetal death, according to a new study from Brazil.The study - which provides some of the strongest evidence that Zika virus causes microcephaly - found that nearly one-third of women who had Zika infections during their pregnancy had an ultrasound that showed fetal abnormalities. These abnormalities included problems with growth, such as microcephaly (meaning an abnormally small head); problems with the placenta; and lesions in the brain or spine.""Zika definitely causes the problems. We think microcephaly is only the tip of the iceberg,"" said study co-author Dr. Karin Nielsen-Saines, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. [Zika Virus FAQs: Top Questions Answered]Infants and fetuses in the study showed a variety of problems, including calcification (or hardening) of brain tissues, problems with the amniotic fluid and an abnormally small body size. There were two stillbirths in the study. Usually, viral infections don't cause only one problem, and because of the array of problems now linked with Zika, the researchers suggest using the term congenitial Zika virus syndrome, Nielsen-Saines said. The new study provided a stronger type of evidence than previous studies of the effects of Zika during pregnancy because it was prospective, meaning that women who went to the clinic in Brazil were tested for Zika and were then followed over time (regardless of whether they tested positive for the virus).In addition, the researchers tested the women for Zika by looking for the virus's genetic material - which is more reliable than looking for antibodies, or proteins produced by the immune system in response to a Zika infection, Nielsen-Saines said.The new study is ""what people have been waiting for,"" in terms of the type of evidence needed to prove that Zika infection in pregnancy causes microcephaly, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist and a senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Center for Health Security, who was not involved in the study. That's because the researchers compared pregnant women infected with the Zika virus with pregnant women who were not infected with Zika virus and lived in the same area - a so-called ""case control"" study.""This is the closest we've gotten to [proving] causation,"" Adalja said. Although more studies are still needed to solidify the link, ""for all intents and purposes, this justifies the concern raised early on,"" that at least a proportion of the microcephaly cases in Brazil were caused by Zika virus, Adalja said. The Zika virus is currently spreading rapidly in Central and South America. Health officials became concerned about a link between the virus and microcephaly after there was a dramatic rise in cases of this birth defect in Brazil last year.The study involved 88 pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro who were tested for Zika virus because they had recently developed a rash - one of the symptoms of the infection. Of these women, 72 tested positive for Zika virus, and they were at various stages of pregnancy - anywhere from five to 38 weeks pregnant.The researchers performed ultrasounds on 42 women who had a Zika infection and 16 women who did not have a Zika infection. (A number of women in the study who tested positive for Zika did not agree to have ultrasounds, Nielsen-Saines said and, in some of those cases, were due to women not wanting to know whether the fetuses they were carrying potentially had health problems.)About 30 percent of the Zika-infected women showed a fetal abnormality on their ultrasound, compared to none of the women without a Zika infection. The Zika-infected women were all previously healthy and did not have other risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, the researchers said. [Zika Virus News: Complete Coverage Of The Outbreak]Five of the Zika-infected women (12 percent) had fetuses with microcephaly, but in most of these cases, the fetus also had a condition called intrauterine growth restriction, meaning the whole fetus, and not just the head, was abnormally small.Seven women (16 percent) had fetuses with lesions on the brain or spinal cord, or other central nervous system problems, and seven women appeared to have placental insufficiency, when the placenta doesn't work as it should so that the fetus does not receive a sufficient amount of oxygen and other nutrients.Two women infected with Zika had stillbirths at 36 and 38 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. In previous studies, there was some speculation that Zika infections may be more damaging if they strike earlier in pregnancy. But in the new findings, the both stillbirths happened in women who were infected late in their pregnancies, Nielsen-Saines said. And in another case, a baby had to be ""urgently delivered"" from a woman with a later Zika infection, because the baby would have died otherwise, she said.None of those three cases involved microcephaly or other problems with the central nervous system, but rather these cases had other problems such as placenta or amniotic fluid abnormalities, she said. There ""may be a high risk of fetal demise with infections in the last trimester,"" she said.The finding that nearly 30 percent of Zika-infected women had an abnormality on their ultrasound is ""worrisome,"" the researchers said. They noted that the rate of fetal death in women with Zika was 4.8 percent, which is about twice the rate of fetal death among women infected with HIV living in the same area.However, Adalja said that because the new study was small and in a single area, more studies are needed before researchers know the true rate of Zika-related pregnancy complications. In addition, there were 30 women in the study who were infected with Zika but did not have an ultrasound. It will be important for future studies to perform ultrasounds on all Zika-infected women in order to generalize the findings, Adalja said. [The 9 Deadliest Viruses on Earth]In Brazil, fears about Zika are running very high, Nielsen-Saines said. ""People are very worried; there is a lot of fear and concern,"" she said. Some pregnant women who become infected with the virus are coming to doctors and requesting to have their labor induced right away - some in the third trimester, but also some still in their second trimester -- in hopes of minimizing the damage to their fetus, she said.The study is published today (March 4) in The New England Journal of Medicine.

"The World Health Organization on Wednesday told Europe to gird for the Zika virus, underscoring the potential reach of the mosquito-borne disease as U.S. lawmakers debate how much money is needed to beat back a potential outbreak here.Portugal's Madeira islands and stretches of Russia and Georgia on the Black Sea are home to the primary mosquito that carries Zika, and therefore face the highest risk, according to the global health arm of the U.N.Eighteen countries are at ""moderate"" risk because they host a second, though less threatening, breed of mosquito that can ferry the virus. France, Italy and Malta face the most danger in this group.The rest of the WHO's European member states - 36 countries - have a low risk of transmission, because their climates aren't hospitable to the disease-carrying insects.""We call particularly on countries at higher risk to strengthen their national capacities and prioritize the activities that will prevent a large Zika outbreak,"" said Dr. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO's regional director for Europe.The call to action comes as Congress takes up funding measures to thwart outbreaks on the U.S. mainland.                                                                    SEE ALSO: Marco Rubio pleads with GOP to fund full Zika request, backfill money later                                            House GOP leaders brushed aside President Obama's veto threat and scheduled a vote this week on a $622 million bill that siphons hundreds of millions of dollars from the Ebola fight in West Africa and other programs toward the Zika fight.Democrats and at least one House Republican on Wednesday said the GOP plan shortchanges states on the front lines of a potential outbreak. They said the government should borrow $1.9 billion to fully satisfy Mr. Obama's request, saying there is neither the time nor enough waste to find the money elsewhere in the country's $4 trillion budget.""The lives of thousands of infants are potentially at risk. There's no excuse for failure to act responsibly and swiftly,"" said Rep. Vern Buchanan, Florida Republican, who wants to fully fund Mr. Obama's request.Zika virus festered for decades in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region before globe-hopping to Latin America, where it is causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads.The WHO said European travelers returning from places where Zika is circulating could set off local transmission in late spring or summer, when mosquitoes will start biting.As of mid-April, the agency had counted 409 travel-related cases of Zika in 17 European countries, including 23 cases in pregnant women.The WHO said it will convene in Portugal in late June to evaluate its members' progress in preparing for Zika.In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control has recorded 500 travel-related cases in the states and D.C., including a handful through sexual transmission, and scientists say the virus could puncture the mainland further once temperatures climb.Mr. Obama has said he will reject the House's bill because it funds only a third of his own request and taps more Ebola funding, instead of backfilling the $510 million he already took from that fight to prepare for the latest health scare.The Senate is pushing a $1.1 billion package that is more generous than the House plan, yet far short of the $1.9 billion that Mr. Obama requested in February.House lawmakers paid for their plan instead of tacking the spending onto the deficit, but the Senate's plan isn't offset with cuts elsewhere, setting up a clash over how to proceed.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Mr. Obama will continue to advocate for a full $1.9 billion.""The only thing that Republicans in the House have come forward with is funding at like a third of the level that our public health experts recommend, but taking every single penny of that money away from efforts to protect the American people from Ebola,"" he said.

"Amadou Alpha Sall, Scientific Director of the Pasteur Institute of Dakar, speaks during a press conference at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the Sao Paulo University, on January 8, 2016 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Researchers at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, Senegal are in Brazil to train local researchers to combat the Zika virus epidemic. (AFP)The mosquito-borne Zika virus has been found in thousands of people across South America and the Caribbean, and has now been found in the US state of Florida.According to a Yahoo report, who quoted AFP:Three cases of Zika were recorded in people who had recently traveled to South America, US health authorities said Wednesday. The first two cases were found in Miami-Dade County, in people who visited Colombia last December. The third case, in Hillsborough County, involved a person who traveled to Venezuela last month, Florida Health Department spokeswoman Mara Gambineri said. ""We encourage Florida residents and visitors to protect themselves from all mosquito-borne illnesses by draining standing water, covering their skin with repellent and clothing, and covering windows with screens,"" Gambineri said.Health authorities throughout South America are struggling to find a way to contain outbreaks due to the speed of transmission and emergence of new cases. Brazil is currently experiencing the largest known outbreak of Zika on the continent, connecting the virus to a surge in babies born with microcephaly. According to a BBC report, who quoted Brazil's Health Ministry, the virus has already killed five babies in the country, and another 44 cases are being investigated.Colombia's health minister told Reuters on Wednesday the virus has already infected more than 13,500 people in Colombia and could hit as many as 700,000.According to Pan-American Health Organization figures, the country is second only to Brazil in infection rates, health minister Alejandro Gaviria told journalists. ""We expect an expansion similar to what we had with the chikungunya virus last year, to finish with between 600,000 and 700,000 cases,"" Gaviria said.A researcher looks at Aedes aegypti mosquitoes kept in a container at a lab of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the Sao Paulo University, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on January 8, 2016. The Zika virus, which is transmitted by the Aedes genus of mosquitoes, cannot spread between humans. (AFP)According to the CDC, the Zika virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, cannot spread between humans.  But for pregnant women, the virus can be transmitted to the fetus, triggering brain damage, and microcephaly, where the brain and skull are abnormally small. The virus often produces flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headaches, joint pain, skin rashes and conjunctivitis.  Those symptoms appear within three to 12 days of the mosquito bite. In 80% of cases, the infection goes unnoticed, and it is very rarely fatal.The Colombian government is now advising women to delay becoming pregnant for six to eight months in a bid to avoid potential infection. The U.S. CDC also issued a travel alert  last week for pregnant women to avoid travel to 14 countries, including Colombia, and territories in the Caribbean and South America.Sources: www.bbc.com/                www.cdc.gov/                news.yahoo.com/                www.reuters.com/...","dailykos","left","16820","zika",513
"Statements from Pope Francis Thursday should be causing heartburn for hardcore Catholic groups that morally object to providing contraception to their employees. What are organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor to do now that the Pope says ""avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil"" and added that using contraception to slow the spread of the Zika virus is preferable to abortion. The Little Sisters is a charitable group that mounted a legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act's birth control mandate, which requires employers to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees. Although the Obama administration struck a compromise that allows such religious groups to opt-out of that coverage while letting a third-party provider step in, the Little Sisters claimed it still made them complicit even though they wouldn't be footing the bill for the coverage. Just this week, the group launched a website to curry favor with the public as it prepares to make its case to the Supreme Court after losing an appeal in the 10th Circuit. The home page describes how the government is ""fighting so hard to force"" the group into compliance. After promising that the Little Sisters' religious beliefs would be protected, the government created a new regulation requiring the Little Sisters to change their healthcare plan to offer services that violate Catholic teaching. That sob story has become a GOP favorite on the campaign trail, with Catholics Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio both promoting the Little Sisters' cause. But if ""avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil"" then doesn't that weaken the group's moral objection that providing contraception would ""violate Catholic teaching.""Pope Francis made the case Thursday that contraception was less evil than the ""absolute evil"" of abortion. Taken further, that rationale suggests that avoiding an unwanted pregnancy (i.e. providing contraception) that could wind up in an abortion is far better than allowing the circumstances to persist that could lead to an abortion. And that's arguably just as true for any unwanted pregnancy as it is for one that involves the Zika virus.Surely, hard-line Catholic scholars will jump through intellectual hoops in order to avoid reaching that very conclusion, but their task just got a lot harder. As the Little Sisters' site says, their quibble ""is not about money, but conscience."" Now that the Pope has outlined a hierarchy of evils with contraception registering lower than abortion, shouldn't strict adherents of Catholic teaching be doing everything in their power to avoid any circumstance that causes ""an absolute evil""?","dailykos","left","16849","zika",420
"Don't be surprised if the mosquito-borne Zika virus making its way through Latin America and the Caribbean spreads within the U.S., national health officials warned Thursday.The virus, which has been making international headlines for months due to its suspected role in serious birth defects and rare neurological disorders, has been a growing concern in the U.S. since since Oct. 2015. That's when Brazil, which is experiencing an outbreak of Zika, first reported an unusual increase in babies born with microcephaly, a birth defect in which the brain is underdeveloped and the head is abnormally small.Thirty-one people in the U.S. have so far been diagnosed with Zika and a microcephalic baby was born in Hawaii, but none of the cases were contracted on U.S. soil. Each involved a person who traveled to a Zika-affected country, where they acquired the virus via local transmission -- when a mosquito picks up the virus from an infected person and transmits it to someone else through a bite. This same scenario is ""likely"" to happen in the U.S., according to Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. In a press conference Thursday, she cited recent outbreaks in the U.S. of dengue fever and chikungunya, two other mosquito-borne diseases active in American thanks to the same host that's currently spreading Zika: the Aedes aegypti mosquito. ""These types of mosquitoes are common in parts of the United States, particularly southern states,"" said Schuchat. ""So it's possible, even likely, that we will see limited Zika outbreaks in the United States.""We do expect that we are at risk for local transmission, and I think we're not going to be surprised to report that,"" she added.Schuchat's predictions align with the World Health Organization's recent warning that Zika will spread across the Americas, with the exceptions of Canada and Chile, where Aedes aegypti isn't found. In one sense, it's possible Zika virus has already been locally transmitted in the U.S. via the territories of Puerto Rico, which has 19 lab-confirmed cases, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which has one. The CDC lists both territories as experiencing ""ongoing transmission."" If past outbreak patterns of dengue fever and chikungunya are a guide, any outbreak of Zika is likely to be contained to specific regions. These other two diseases have been mostly confined to the southern tips of Florida and Texas, so Zika virus will probably not spread far beyond that.""That's not going to be an unexpected phenomenon, to see a little cluster very likely in the southeastern part of the country along the gulf coast of Florida, the way we saw it with dengue and with chikungunya,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Schuchat pointed out infrastructural advantages that should help contain Zika in the U.S. Our urban neighborhoods aren't as dense as the areas where the virus is spreading easily in other countries, and our existing mosquito control measures and widespread use of air conditioning -- as opposed to relying on unscreened, open-air windows -- lead American health authorities to think Zika virus' appearance in the U.S. will be small and short-lived.Despite these assurances, Schuchat admitted that community mosquito control may be ""difficult"" in the U.S., and that the current methods employed by local health authorities have shortcomings.Currently, mosquito control methods include eliminating breeding sites, treating water with pesticides to destroy mosquito eggs, and fogging outdoors to kill adult mosquitos. But despite these strategies to fight mosquitos at every stage of their life cycle, mosquitos are hardy insects, and the aedes aegypti in particular is an aggressive daytime biter. It wouldn't take very many of them to start infecting people with Zika virus, said Schuchat.Zika s a tropical disease with mild symptoms like fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis (red, itchy eyes) that last for up to a week. Not everyone infected with the virus even experiences them. But in Oct. 2015, during the widespread outbreak in Brazil, health authorities there noticed that the epidemic coincided with a dramatic increase in microcephaly cases. From 2010 to 2014, Brazil recorded an average of only 156 microcephaly cases per year. But from Oct. 2015 to date -- a mere four months -- there have been over 4,000 cases. While it isn't confirmed whether or not Zika virus is causing these serious and potentially fatal birth defects, a handful of health authorities in various countries, including Brazil, are now advising women to delay pregnancy if possible while Zika virus continues to spread. Zika may also be implicated in an uptick in Guillian-Barre syndrome, which prompts a body's immune system to attack its nerves, resulting in temporary paralysis and, in rare cases, death.Schuchat emphasized that the best way Americans can protect themselves against Zika is to not travel to areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission, especially if they are pregnant. There are at present so many unknowns about how Zika virus could affect an ongoing pregnancy, Schuchat said, that postponing travel would be ""prudent.""""For the average American who is not traveling, this is not something they need to worry about,"" she concluded. ""For people who are pregnant and considering travel to the affected areas, please take this seriously.""Zika virus is currently spreading in 24 countries and territories in Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The CDC has issued a level two health warning about these countries, advising pregnant travelers to postpone visits to these destinations if possible. And if they absolutely can't put off travel, pregnant women and all American travelers in general should follow the strictest mosquito bite prevention protocol, including wearing long sleeves and pants, using products with active ingredients like DEET, picaridin or IR3535.    ","huffingtonpost","left","16828","zika",1101
"The U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) has recommended that any athlete or trainer concerned about the Zika outbreak in Latin America should consider not attending the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.Two anonymous sources told Reuters that the USOC issued the suggestion late in January on a teleconference call. President and board chairman of USA fencing Donald Anthony said no person should travel if ""they don't feel comfortable going. Bottom line.""""One of the things that they immediately said was, especially for women that may be pregnant or even thinking of getting pregnant, that whether you are scheduled to go to Rio or no, that you shouldn't go,"" explained Anthony. ""And no one should go if they feel at all as though that that threat could impact them.""The U.S. has advised all pregnant women not to travel to the 33 countries affected by Zika.""We are closely monitoring the situation through the CDC and have ongoing contact with the International Olympic Committee, the organizing officials in Rio, the World Health Organization and infectious disease specialists with expertise in tropical diseases, including the Zika virus,"" wrote Patrick Sandusky, a USOC spokesperson, in an email to TIME. ""Additionally, we're taking steps to ensure that our delegation and those affiliated with Team USA are aware of the CDC's recommendations regarding travel to Brazil.""Dr. Art Caplan of the NYU Langone Medical Center told Breitbart News Daily the Olympic committee should delay the games for at least six months.""You've got this outbreak going on, and you're going to expose hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, who go down there to attend the Olympics or participate in them,"" he stated. ""We don't have a cure, we don't have a vaccine, there is now a couple of cases that have been reported about transmission of the virus into the blood supply, we don't have a good test for that why would we be trying to run an Olympics in a country that is straining, anyway?""Despite the name, the Summer Olympics will take place during winter in Brazil, so officials hope the cooler weather will kill the Aedes aegypti mosquito known to spread Zika and diminish the threat. Spring formally begins in September.The Australian Olympic Committee encouraged its female athletes to educate themselves about Zika and ""consider the risks of competing in the Rio Olympics due to the outbreak of Zika.""""Any team members who are pregnant at the time of the Games need to consider the risks very carefully before deciding whether to proceed with travel to Brazil,"" they said.Athletes will receive mosquito repellent from officials, who also recommend everyone wear long sleeves when possible.""The health and wellbeing of all our team members is paramount, especially those females in the team of child bearing age,"" declared Australian Olympic Team Chef de Mission Kitty Chillier. ""We have a responsibility to ensure that we educate and inform all prospective team members of the potential risks and to put in place whatever mitigating measures we can.""The World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a public health emergency on February 1, due to the thousands of cases of the virus linked to birth defects in newborn children. Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which occurs when the brain does not form properly and results in a small head. This leads to serious mental disabilities.Following the outbreak of Zika, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases compared to the 147 in 2014.Brazil promised to fumigate and sterilize Olympic stadiums leading up to the games.

"A new tool aims to help poor countries manage epidemics, before they devastate their health and finances.The World Bank recently launched the ""Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility"" an insurance market designed to quickly disburse funds to countries and agencies tackling infectious disease outbreaks. ""Pandemics pose some of the biggest threats in the world to people's lives and to economies,"" Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank Group, said in a statement. ""For the first time we will have a system that can move funding and teams of experts to the sites of outbreaks before they spin out of control.""Over the last two years, the Ebola epidemic caused more than 11,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. It also severely weakened economies in West Africa, costing Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone a collective $2.8 billion in GDP losses, according to the World Bank. If the new financing had existed in mid-2014, when Ebola first began spreading, the global cost of responding to the outbreak could have been cut from a whopping $7 billion to $300 million -- or 4 percent of what was spent -- Keith Hansen, World Bank vice-president, told the Financial Times. More crucially, the outbreak might also have been more easily contained, saving countless lives. ""This [new financing] facility addresses a long, collective failure in dealing with pandemics,"" Kim said. ""The Ebola crisis taught us that we must respond immediately to save lives and protect economic growth.""The new mechanism gets its funding in a complex way: Money from donor countries like Japan, combined with funds raised from the reinsurance market and World Bank-issued bonds, provide coverage of up to $500 million, according to FT.Only the poorest countries -- or the 77 countries who receive funding from the International Development Association -- will be eligible for the pandemic support.Some development experts worry that the funding mechanism is too complex, and that the $500 million available for deployment is simply not enough.""Anything less than a very substantial amount of money in the billions is going to be inadequate,"" Laurie Garrett, of the Council on Foreign Relations, told Devex. While it may not be the perfect solution, funding for international crises is sorely needed. Though humanitarian aid hit a record high last year, it still wasn't enough to address the demand from U.N.-led appeals. Doctors Without Borders even ditched a humanitarian summit this week, partly in protest that more funding is needed for emergency responses, including in conflict areas and epidemic situations.

"House Democrats urging action on Zika back in April.After three months of delays, the Senate has finally passed funding to combat the spread of Zika.The Senate approved $1.1 billion in funding to fight the Zika virus Thursday, putting itself on a collision course with the House. [...]The vote comes less than a day after the House approved $622 million in Zika funds, despite opposition from House Democrats, senators and the White House. It's not just that the two bills differ in the dollars attached. They're completely different bills. The Senate's $1.1 billion is attached to an unrelated spending bill which contains a number of controversial rule changes. The House bill is a bill about relaxing rules on pesticides-which has already picked up a promise of veto from the White House-with a new name attached. The money in the House bill isn't actually a new allocation for Zika, it's funds that the administration was previously using to fight ebola, but which have already been diverted to Zika after the legislature failed to act.In fact, the Senate measure and the Obama request are fairly similar when it comes to how much money to spend on Zika; the main difference is that the president wants back the almost $600 million he diverted last month from the Ebola battle and other accounts. That money is being used to conduct research on the virus and Zika-related birth defects, create response teams to limit Zika's spread, and help other countries fight the virus.The difference between the $1.1 billion Senate bill and the House bill? About $1.1 billion. The Senate bill and House bill have almost nothing in common. The word ""Zika"" appears in them both. That's about it. The House bill will advance as a stand-alone, the Senate bill as an amendment to a bill the House is yet to pick up.

"A mosquito-borne virus that may have caused serious birth defects for thousands of babies in Brazil made its way to Puerto Rico by the end of last year, and experts are grappling with what this means -- if anything -- for North America.Zika has been characterized in the past as an annoying but generally harmless sickness, with symptoms like rash, fever, joint-pain and red eyes. In fact, about one in four who get infected with disease probably don't even notice they have it.But when the virus became widespread in Brazil in 2015, with an estimated 500,000 to 1.5 million residents contracting Zika, health officials noticed that it coincided with a sharp increase in microcephaly, a condition in which a fetus' brain doesn't grow to full size and the baby is born with an abnormally small head.Between 2010 and 2014, Brazil had an average of 156 babies born with microcephaly each year. But in 2015, over 3,000 babies were born with the condition, reports The Wall Street Journal. So far, authorities are investigating these babies, as well as deaths that are suspected to be linked to microcephaly, to see if they harbor any trace of the Zika virus. If Zika follows the same migratory patterns as other mosquito-borne viruses like dengue fever and the chikungunya virus, experts say Texas, Florida and Hawaii could be at risk of an outbreak in the future.With that in mind, here are four things you should know about Zika and its potential spread to the U.S.The lifelong consequences of microcephaly could include mental retardation, developmental delays, dwarfism and seizures, although some children with the condition grow up to have normal intelligence and development. While the potential link between a mosquito bite and lifelong birth defects is scary, it's important to note that a lot of different things can cause microcephaly, like certain genetic disorders, exposure to toxic chemicals and even a traumatic birth. Brazilian health officials say there is a link between Zika and microcephaly, but experts from the World Health Organization and others who spoke to The Huffington Post are still reserving judgment.  Dr. Anna Durbin, a vaccinologist and expert in dengue fever from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, praised Brazil for their vigorous investigation into the matter but echoed WHO's perspective -- it's too early to say that the virus causes this or any birth defect.""The appropriate approach is to say we've had a large increase in microcephaly, we don't know the cause and we're concerned about the fact that we're also having a Zika outbreak,"" said Durbin. ""But to say there's a link when it hasn't been confirmed is actually more problematic.""After a large outbreak of Zika virus in French Polynesia in 2013, experts suspected a link between the disease and neurological complications like Guillain-Barré syndrome, which has symptoms including tingling in the legs and arms and paralysis. However, Zika had never before been linked to pre-natal or birth complications until Brazil started noticing the uptick of microcephaly.Currently, some Brazilian doctors are advising women to avoid getting pregnant while officials figure out what's going on, and women in Brazil who are currently pregnant say they're feeling extremely stressed about the news. Zika was first discovered in 1947, and has broken out in different countries in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Over the past year, the disease has also spread in parts of Central and South America. The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the most common carrier of the disease, and Aedes albopictus is another potential vector. They originate from Africa and Asia, respectively. Aedes albopictus, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito for its white stripes, is considered the most invasive species of mosquito.Both species typically bite during the day and at dusk, which is why mosquito nets for sleeping aren't useful in the fight against Zika, according to Durbin. Each species can also infect people with dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever, causing serious problems in other parts of the world. America's widespread use of air conditioning and window screens has prevented these illnesses from becoming major epidemics in the U.S.The reason experts suspect Zika might become endemic -- defined as transmission that occurs in the U.S. -- is because the same mosquitos that carry the virus have also caused recent dengue and chikungunya outbreaks in Texas, Florida and Hawaii.Hawaii is seeing its largest dengue outbreak since the 1940s, with 210 cases reported between Sept. 2015 and Dec. 2015. And in 2014, Florida saw 11 local cases of chikungunya.  While this doesn't sound like good news, these outbreaks are also examples of what the U.S. gets right when it comes to mosquito-borne diseases: air conditioners and window screens are the norm, and local governments vigilantly monitor and eradicate disease-causing mosquitoes. ""Despite going through a similar rapid spread through Latin America about 15 years ago, [dengue] hasn't really ever done more than appear sporadically in the U.S.A.,"" said Derek Gatherer, a researcher who specializes in the evolution of viruses at Lancaster University in the U.K.On the other hand, West Nile virus, another disease that spreads through mosquitoes, has been able to permanently establish itself in the U.S. because it can survive in humans, horses, and birds, giving the virus a wider variety of hosts. Zika, dengue and chikungunya generally only survive in humans. ""Zika might well be more like dengue and chikungunya and less like West Nile virus -- we'll just have to wait and see,"" said Gatherer. ""If it is like dengue, then Zika might just stop at the Mexican border"" because of mosquito control efforts in the U.S. There is no vaccine for Zika virus, and no cure other than rest, plenty of fluids and perhaps over-the-counter medication to reduce fevers, aches and pains. Because of this, prevention is paramount.If you're flying to a country where Zika virus is endemic, take anti-mosquito measures seriously. Put mosquito repellant on your clothes and skin, wear long sleeves and pants, and sleep underneath mosquito nets at night -- even though the mosquitos that transmit Zika are mostly daytime biters, you'll rest easier. In December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel warning with all of this advice to Americans going to Mexico, the Caribbean and other parts of Central and South America. If after your return you start to feel any sickness that requires care, be sure to tell doctors and nurses immediately about your most recent trip. Zika's symptoms are similar to many other diseases and can be easily confused with the common cold or another mosquito-borne disease.The CDC warns that if you actually do come down with Zika virus, it becomes even more important for you to avoid mosquitoes -- you don't want to be able to give the insects something they can spread to other people. More broadly, the most effective way to guard against zika virus is to guard against mosquitos in general. That means ferreting out puddles of standing water on your property, setting traps for mosquitoes and perhaps calling your city or county's vector control services to fog areas with chemicals that can kill the insects or their eggs. ""The concern really should be about mosquito control and prevention of mosquito bites, rather than concern or fear about a specific disease,"" said Dr. Andi Shane, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Emory University. ""If we can control the vector, it's less likely that we'll have the infection.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that both the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were known vectors of the Zika virus. However, Aedes albopictus is only a potential vector at this time. ","huffingtonpost","left","16811","zika",1297
"Venezuela may be the weakest link in the fight against Zika in the Americas, Colombian Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria warned this week, with experts asserting that the socialist nation may be hiding hundreds of thousands of cases of contamination of the pervasive virus.Accusing Venezuelan health officials of ""an epidemiological silence,"" Gaviria noted that Venezuela appears to have ""no systematic reporting of the data"" regarding how many people nationwide have been confirmed to carry the Zika virus. ""This is a serious problem,"" he underlined. Gaviria estimates that Colombia may conclude 2016 with up to 650,000 cases of Zika recorded within their borders.Colombian health officials have confirmed 20,297 cases of Zika since Brazilian scientists identified the African virus in the region in 2015. Of these, 2,100 are pregnant women, who suffer greater risk of serious harm though contracting the virus. While most Zika patients - 80 percent - do not experience any symptoms, and those who do experience only mild fevers and aches. Pregnant Zika patients, however, run the risk of passing the virus to their unborn children. Brazilian scientists have tied the virus to microcephaly, a severe deformity in infants in which the skull does not develop to fit the brain, causing significant neurological damage.Venezuela has reported a significantly smaller number of Zika cases than Colombia, despite the countries sharing a border. Official Venezuelan estimates claim medical experts have recorded 4,700 suspected cases of Zika. Health Minister Luisana Melo is leading a door-to-door awareness campaign, teaching residents in urban and poorer areas how to dispose of still water properly and keep from inadvertently developing breeding grounds for Aedes aegypti, the mosquito known to carry Zika, as well as Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever.The Venezuelan Health Ministry stopped issuing weekly health bulletins more than a year ago, Reuters notes, meaning no official record of the number of suspected Zika cases before the government published the 4,700 number exist. Infectious disease specialist Julio Castro tells Reuters he believes the real number of cases is in the six digits, somewhere between a quarter and half a million people.The Venezuelan government has not released information regarding the number of Zika cases in pregnant women, those most at risk for serious damage from the virus. The Health Ministry has, however, reported that 255 of the known cases appear to be linked to Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a serious disorder that affects mobility.While the government has insisted it is prepared to treat Zika patients, many observers fear that the Venezuelan health care system is too weak to control a pandemic, as the National Institutes of Health have deemed this Zika outbreak. Venezuela's health services depend heavily on Cuban doctors forced to work for living stipends by their communist government. Cuban doctors, while heralded by the international left, are often significantly undertrained, and have caused international incidents through training programs that have generated incompetent local doctors in nations like Tuvalu.In addition to the questionable ability of Venezuela's important medical help, the nation has suffered from intense shortages of most common medications. One local report claims that those already suffering from Zika have no access to basic medical goods like aspirin, and women looking to avoid becoming pregnant have no access to contraception. Store shelves have no insect repellent, and ""in poor neighborhoods, people hoard water, often in open containers, because [government infrastructure] is irregular and the current drought has worsened the situation."" Poor Venezuelans also often live in neighborhoods in which, due to lack of streamlined government services, garbage lines the streets for weeks on end.Venezuela's National Pharmaceutical Federation declared a ""humanitarian emergency"" last week. ""The national government must accept we are in a humanitarian crisis in the health sector, with patients dying across our territory for lack of medicines,"" Freddy Ceballos, the head of the federation, said. Yolanda Carrasquel, another federation official, declared that a high percentage of pharmacies are facing ""100 percent shortage on a national level"" of all drugs. The federation released a list of 150 medications that are most difficult to find, ranging from basic painkillers to cancer and AIDS medication.In December, Ceballos warned that his federation had received multiple reports that Venezuelan pharmacies had begun resorting to prescribing veterinary drugs for people in cases where importing human-use drugs was impossible.","breitbart","right","16833","zika",705
"Tragically, pregnancies across the U.S. and around the world are deeply unequal.  The outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil and Latin America and its association with microcephaly reflect this reality. Microcephaly is a condition in which newborns are born with an unusually small head and brain. If they survive, infants often face a lifetime of physical and developmental challenges. During the first trimester of my pregnancy, my partner and I were living and working in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Within days of learning of the virus' presence in the city, we boarded a plane to return to the U.S. Our departure marked the difference between thousands of other parents and us - we had the immeasurable privilege of mobility.   Since October 2015, 4,180 cases of microcephaly have been reported in Brazil.  A generation of Brazilian children will grow up in need of tremendous support; yet, the medical, scientific, and public health communities have limited knowledge of the virus' association to microcephaly.  While the recent Center for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization warnings advising pregnant women to postpone travel to countries affected by the virus will hopefully prevent those who would have otherwise traveled for work or pleasure from contracting the virus; women and their partners living in affected countries have little choice but to live in everyday fear.    My partner and I are grateful that we had resources and citizenship privileges to leave.  When our local public health department in the U.S. called to say that I tested negative for Zika, we cried in gratitude.  It was an unspeakable relief.  But we also feel a real sadness.  To make a major life decision that so clearly differentiated our unborn child from thousands of others was painful.  Consciously embodying inequality is always uncomfortable; yet, this discomfort may be instructive in a world where we would often rather not look at the ways in which our decisions reproduce entrenched inequities.Pregnancy is a deeply embodied experience. As a researcher of gender and inequality, I am aware of the ways inequality is marked on pregnant female bodies in innumerable ways.  Whether in the U.S. or Brazil, privileged, frequently white, middle and upper-class women, such as myself, often spend nine months imagining a nursery, registering for baby gifts, attending prenatal yoga, eating nourishing food, writing a birth plan, and receiving excellent medical care. In contrast, far less-privileged, poor and working-class women, often of color, frequently labor in fields, factories, or other people's homes for the entirety of their pregnancy, placing them at higher risk for environmental and toxic exposure and for the dangers of heavy lifting.  They often have limited access to nutritious food and safe drinking water, and receive limited or inadequate medical treatment and preventive care.  In many ways, pregnancy marks the beginning of very unequal lives.As with other infectious diseases, risk of exposure to the Zika virus mirrors racial, class, and geographic-based inequalities that run through all aspects of our lives.  While mosquitos don't adhere to zip codes or neighborhood boundaries, outbreaks of infectious diseases tend to disproportionately impact poor and vulnerable populations due to the social, economic, environmental, and medical determinants of health.  Poor and working-class women are far more likely than middle-class or wealthy Brazilian women to live in communities whose water and sanitation infrastructure has been neglected by the government for decades creating conditions for mosquitos to easily breed, reside in homes without air-conditioning resulting in open windows and doors, and travel to work at dawn and return at dusk when mosquito activity is at its peak.  As public health officials in Brazil, El Salvador, and other countries tell women to delay pregnancy for up to two years, limited access to affordable contraception, particularly emergency contraception, and strict abortion laws present many women with little recourse. Unfortunately, this leads to an increase in clandestine abortions that pose major health risks to the mother. A Brazilian judge recently began to approve a series of case-by-case legal abortions when a fetus is diagnosed with microcephaly despite intense political and religious opposition.As feminist Sonia Corrêa has noted, the political approach of governments telling women to avoid pregnancy assumes ""women themselves responsible for having or not having babies with microcephaly.""  This places the onus of responsibility for the condition and its life-long consequences onto women and moves it away from the state, whose insufficient actions since the Zika outbreak, inadequate control of mosquitos during prior mosquito-borne outbreaks, and historical neglect of women's sexual and reproductive health are exacerbating the situation.  Moreover, since the outbreak began, women whose infants have been born with microcephaly in Brazil have reported inadequate care and attention by the public health system, which seems unprepared to deal with the crisis.  As one mother, Marilia Lima, explained in a story reported on NPR, ""We are alone. We have been abandoned by the state.""  The impact of the Zika virus' recent outbreak on mothers, fetuses, and newborns serves as a tragic reminder that maternal, prenatal, and infant health are neglected and underfunded on national and global scales.  While the Zika virus necessitates immediate coordinated national and regional approaches to combat its spread, the virus is only one of the myriad ways in which lives begin unequally.  It is imperative that those with time, resources, and influence pressure their local, state, and national governments, international institutions, and non-governmental organizations to invest money and other resources in research, public policies, medical treatment, and preventive care that prioritize the health and well-being of women, fetuses, and infants who are most at risk.","huffingtonpost","left","16832","zika",955
"Co-authored with Donald WertliebThe Zika virus epidemic, first observed in Brazil in Spring of 2015, has spread to 43 countries and territories in the Americas.  Although Zika has relatively mild clinical symptoms in adults and children, scientists have recently confirmed that the disease can cause microcephaly, Guillain-Barre syndrome and other neurological disorders.  The growing number of cases of  microcephaly, caused by congenital Zika infection, has been declared a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" by the World Health Organization (WHO).   Officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have warned that ""everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we originally thought.""  Thousands of infants with microcephaly have been reported throughout the Americas.  Infants with this birth malformation have smaller head circumferences and significant developmental and learning difficulties.  Many of them will need health and social supports such as specialized health services, early childhood intervention, special education instruction, and family respite care throughout their lifetime.  Will the families and communities of these children be prepared to care for them in all the affected countries?Zika Underscores Importance of Disability RightsAs a recent editorial in the American Journal of Public Health  highlighted, this tragic epidemic offers an opportunity to the global community--that is, the recognition of supports needed by infants and children with disabilities and their families.  How communities and countries respond to this epidemic of infants with microcephaly and other Zika-associated-disabilities will reveal their approach and commitment to inclusion of individuals with disabilities in their communities.  These children should not be placed in institutions, as they once were in the United States before the passage of state and federal legislation that gave children with disabilities the right to inclusion and participation in their community. This tragedy also  points out the importance of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which recognizes ""the inherent dignity and worth and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family"" and ""the importance of mainstreaming disability issues as an integral part of relevant strategies of sustainable development.""    All countries that have signed and ratified the convention document have made a commitment against placing children in institutional settings in favor of community settings.   We recognize, however, that this is a major financial commitment for some low- and middle-income countries, which will likely need assistance from wealthier countries. From Tragedy to Awareness: Connecting the Dots for Disability, Children's RightsThis is a time for the global community to embrace and assert the rights of infants with disabilities and eliminate stigmas often associated with disability.    We recommend that the WHO, Pan American Health Organization, CDC, USAID, and others encourage and prioritize inclusive early childhood development services and programs for the care and support of infants with disabilities and their families.  Nongovernmental organizations such as CARE, PLAN International and Save the Children that have done so much to advance human rights and foster investment in early childhood development must now ensure that their programs and policies adapt and respond to this new group of children with disabilities and forge the way for a truly inclusive and cross-sectoral approach to health, education, and social protection.  The Early Childhood Development Task Force of the Global Partnership on Children with Disabilities is working to assure children with disabilities are included. Now is the time for individuals, communities, and nations to seize this opportunity  to connect the dots between the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities to affirm the rights of all children, including those with disabilities. This is the moment to catalyze the capacity for inclusive early childhood development services and to make individuals, communities and countries more aware of disabilities. We must provide the needed supports so that these children can be cared for at home and in their communities, as is their right.   Children and families should not be shamed or shunned but embraced and supported with compassion as they cope with the impact of a terrible disease acquired in utero.  Let us turn a tragedy into an awareness and action campaign that will change how the world accepts millions with disabilities. .Deborah Klein Walker is a Vice President and Senior Fellow at Abt Associates.

"Senate Democrats accused the GOP majority Tuesday of paying lip service to lead-poisoned families in Michigan and waffling in its response to the Zika virus that's threatening U.S. shores, signaling they will use both crises as a prism for each party's philosophy on federal intervention.Democrats have decided to block a bipartisan energy bill until Republicans greenlight millions in federal aid for Flint, Michigan, as it reels from tainted drinking water, forcing negotiators to scramble for a deal that could break the logjam.And they've already rallied behind President Obama's $1.8 billion plan to fight the Zika virus, which has been tied to a serious birth defect in Latin America, saying the GOP and its presidential hopefuls are too busy litigating Mr. Obama's regulatory agenda to mount an adequate response to the crises.""The private sector isn't going to stop the Zika virus; the private sector isn't going to get the lead out of the water in the pipes in Flint; the private sector isn't going to protect us from ISIS,"" said Sen. Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, using a common acronym for the Islamic State terror group.Republican leaders insist they are taking a sober approach to both issues. They invited the administration to explain whether it has the resources it needs to fight Zika, and they say it is the Democrats who won't take yes for an answer on Flint.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who wrote the energy bill, said last week she proposed an amendment that would provide $550 million to Flint - $50 million upfront - but that it was spurned by Democrats, prompting Sens. Debbie Stabenow, Michigan Democrat, and James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, to go back to the negotiating table.Flint has been plagued by lead-tainted water since the city switched its water supply from Detroit's system to the Flint River in early 2014. Corrosion from inadequately treated water caused lead to leach from pipes.Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, declined to testify about what led to the crisis before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee on Wednesday, citing plans to stay home and propose an additional $195 million in state funding to address the crisis.The Associated Press said that proposal includes $25 million to replace lead-contaminated pipes, bringing the total state allocation to the crisis to $232 million should lawmakers approve the plans.Senate Democrats still want guaranteed federal funding for Flint, and have pledged to pursue an actual deal instead of settling for show votes on amendments.""Their nightmare, which began almost two years ago, is an emergency that requires a federal response,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said.More than once, Democrats have tied the Flint situation to Mr. Obama's request for resources to fight Zika at home and abroad, saying both natural and man-made disasters demand their attention.But Senate Republicans who exited an amicable briefing on the Zika threat said they want to make sure the administration is using existing funds wisely before they pony up more.""Before you appropriate money, you want to make sure it's going to the right place, to the right people, to do the important things,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, Tennessee Republican.Republicans suggested Tuesday there is roughly $1.4 billion in unspent Ebola funds that could be shifted to the campaign against Zika, which may have caused an uptick in microcephaly - a condition in which babies are born with abnormally small heads - in Brazil and other Latin countries.But administration officials insisted they needed new funding to fight the pesky mosquito breed that spreads Zika and to protect the homeland.Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said funds for the Ebola fight have been obligated, and that it would be foolhardy to redirect them.""That global health security money was appropriated for over a five-year period,"" she said. ""That's what the Congress advised us to do. The plans are in place."" ","washingtontimes","right","16840","zika",664
"MATAMOROS, Tamaulipas - The appearance of the Zika virus in Mexico has kept Mexican health officials on alert after the country has seen more than 34 cases in recent weeks. In the border city of Reynosa, authorities have confirmed one case. After the first cases were reported, fear and uncertainty began to take root among the general population, particularly among pregnant women who fear the damage that the illness could case to their babies. So far the cases that have been reported in Mexico are linked to the ""importation"" of the virus by people who were infected in Central and South America. In this border state, health authorities have identified one case in Reynosa. According to state health officials, the victim was identified as a man who had recently traveled to Colombia which is one of the countries that has seen an outbreak of the disease. The man's symptoms were identified early on-allowing him to get medical treatment. He is listed as in good condition and public health officials expect his health to continue improving. In response to the spread of concerns at the national level, Tamaulipas Public Health Director Norberto Trevino spoke about the concerns brought about by the new disease which is spread through mosquitoes. According to Trevino, the current priority in Tamaulipas is aimed at eradicating mosquito breeding spots and advising the public about the importance of keeping their homes mosquito free. Zika is an illness that is spread through the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which in the past has caused concern in this border region because it also spreads Dengue fever and Chikungunya, the public health official said. The symptoms for Zika tend to be less severe in comparison to those of Dengue or Chikungunya, however, the concerns deal with the cases of microcephaly in pregnant women. In response to the concerns over this new disease, Trevino warned the public to remain vigilant particularly with children, pregnant women. Health officials are working an outreach campaign to warn the public about brushy areas, as well as tires, flower pots, buckets and other items that can hold water puddles and can be potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In Tamaulipas, health officials are being extra vigilant in order to identify patients who suffer from fever-related illnesses. ","breitbart","right","16835","zika",376
"Americans are more likely to catch the Zika virus from a trip abroad than a mosquito bite in their backyard, and officials along the threatened Gulf Coast want to keep it that way, drawing up game plans to defend against disease-carrying insects before they spark an outbreak on the mainland.Louisiana State University's diagnostics lab is geared up to test mosquito samples from at-risk parishes, while the Florida Keys' mosquito control board is going door to door with the Navy and Coast Guard to leave door hangers and educate people about Zika, which causes serious birth defects.The virus is a wily one, in that many people don't exhibit symptoms. State officials say that shouldn't be a serious problem, so long as they are vigilant and rely on systems they've used to defend against viruses like West Nile and dengue.""We don't get frustrated, we just get busy,"" said Raoult Ratard, state epidemiologist for Louisiana.The Centers for Disease Control has recorded nearly 600 travel-related cases of Zika in the states and D.C., a handful of them through sexual transmission. As temperatures climb and insects flourish, scientists fear that Aedes mosquitoes will begin to bite infected travelers and then spread the disease with their next blood meal, sparking the type of local transmission that afflicts Latin American countries, including the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.""If you get bitten by this mosquito when you travel someplace where it might be pervasive, you not only get bitten yourself, you bring it home,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Friday, imploring Congress to fulfill President Obama's $1.9 billion request to fight Zika, though Republican leaders are negotiating a smaller amount.As it stands, the CDC says it cannot predict the extent to which Zika will spread in the continental U.S., though it notes that mosquitoes capable of carrying the virus can be found as far north as Cincinnati, New York City and San Francisco.States on the Gulf of Mexico are on the front lines of a potential outbreak, because their hot and wet climates attract Zika's primary vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito.Alabama officials said is it ""critical"" that all health providers are required to report all test results of suspected Zika cases to its Department of Health, so investigators can determine if someone picked up the virus abroad or if local transmission has begun.Taking their cues from the CDC, states are testing for Zika based on a patient's travel history and symptoms such as fever, mild rash or joint pain.""If it's determined there is actually a Zika case, it's referred over to me,"" said Kyle Moppert, medical entomologist for the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.If the infected person was likely exposed to local mosquitoes, he should notify local abatement teams so health officials can spray a radius of 150 meters from where that person lives. They will not do anything to single out the affected household, due to health information privacy laws, and will go door-to-door in the community to look for potential mosquito breeding sites.""Anything that holds water is very important in this case,"" Mr. Moppert said.Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are mainly found in several parishes around Lake Pontchartrain, though another known vector, the Aedes albopictus, is found throughout Louisiana.The Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at LSU tests thousands of mosquito pools - plus chickens, wild birds and horses - for a variety of viruses, from West Nile to chikungunya, and sends reports to mosquito control districts and state and federal officials.Now, it has added Zika to the list, said Alma Roy, the lab's assistant director.""We have not tested any mosquitos for Zika at this time, but stand ready,"" she said.Further east, the Florida Keys is exploring a series of techniques to knock down mosquito populations before they can spread Zika. A plan to release genetically modified mosquitoes that produce unviable offspring has proven controversial, however, and will go before local voters in August.For now, the Keys will rely on its traditional methods for dealing with mosquitoes, should someone bring the virus back with them. That means a lot of local spraying, including the use of aerial spraying if the virus begins to spread on its own.Yet so far, the Keys haven't seen any travel-related cases.""However, since only one in five who have Zika develop any symptoms,"" Mr. Goodman said, ""we could have cases and do not know it."" ","washingtontimes","right","16950","zika",750
"We've been covering the Zika virus and monitoring any progress that's been being made so far, and we're pleased to report some good news for a change. It appears that an experimental Zika vaccine is in the works and is slated for human test trials after being approved by health officials in the US.Inovio Pharmaceuticals was granted approval by the Food and Drug Administration to begin early-stage tests of its vaccination, which is a DNA-based vaccine. The company has said that it hopes to begin human testing some time during the fall of this year.The vaccine that is being designed is geared towards charging up the immune system so it can fight the Zika virus by using genetically engineered components that help the immune system tackle the virus. According to Inovio, the vaccine was very responsive in animal testing.A 40-person study is slated to begin this fall, and the company has stated that they hope to show positive results by the end of the year. At the present, there are no drugs that can treat the virus currently. And it's unknown how far or fast the virus could spread over the next year.People contract the Zika virus after being bitten by mosquitoes that are carrying the infection. It only causes a temporarily and often unnoticeable illness, but has been linked to dangerous birth defects and birth fatalities.Over the past year, it's spread like wildfire in Latin America, creating one of the biggest worldwide health scares since the SARS virus.We'll keep on following any updates of this virus and will be reporting back to you to keep you informed.According to the CDC, only 755 travel cases have been reported so far in the US. But 1,455 cases have been reported in US territories. 141 of the domestic reported cases were reported in Florida, with California coming in second with 48 reported cases.Zika can be transmitted sexually from infected partners, prompting health officials to warn people to have protected sex or to refrain from sexual activity if they have become infected until cleared by a doctor.","huffingtonpost","left","16978","zika",369
"President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff hosted a meeting among leaders of various Brazilian Christian denominations Tuesday, requesting they actively engage their congregation in awareness and prevention methods to combat the ongoing Zika epidemic in the region.Brazil's O Globo newspaper reports that Rousseff met with the leaders of the National Council of Christian Churches in Brazil (CONIC) - which includes, among others, the Catholic, Presbyterian, Syrian Orthodox, Episcopal, and Evangelical churches - requesting that they actively discuss Zika in their churches. Representatives of CONIC told O Globo they believe that addressing Zika prevention in sermons will help populations take the virus seriously.""It is necessary that the churches take their social role mobilizing the faithful to fight various problems related to sanitation, but, in particular, combating Aedes aegypti,"" Joel Zeferino, president of the Baptists Alliance of Brazil, told the newspaper. The Zika virus is spread through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which thrives in hot, humid climates. Preventing pools of stagnant water from collecting, particularly in unsanitary areas, is key to keeping the mosquito population low and diminishing the threat of spreading Zika.President Rousseff has previously attempted to address the nation regarding the dangers of the Zika outbreak, delivering a national address last week. Due to various scandals during her tenure, particularly a corruption scandal involving the state-owned oil corporation Petrobras, Brazilians drowned out her speech on Zika with ""panelaço"" protests, in which residents of at least five cities filled the streets with the sound of banging pots and pans.Rousseff has also attempted to recruit the international, and particularly Latin American, community into the struggle against Zika. In January, Rousseff called for an emergency meeting of the regional trade bloc Mercosur to discuss preventing the spread of Zika over international borders. In addition to Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and El Salvador have documented tens of thousands of Zika cases in the past six months.Rouseff has also deployed over 200,000 Brazilian soldiers to go door-to-door in the nation's most-affected communities, distributing literature on how to protect against Zika, giving pregnant women insect repellant, and warning residents to wear long-sleeved clothing to prevent mosquito bites.O Globo notes that those who discussed the meeting all said Rousseff mentioned only prevention and awareness, and did not discuss the issue of abortion. Abortion is illegal in Brazil except in cases of rape, incest, and threat to the life of the mother, and a judge must approve all individual abortions. While the Zika virus typically (in 80 percent of cases) does not trigger any symptoms in adult patients, and those who do suffer symptoms report mild ones, studies have begun to uncover a link between Zika and a number of birth defects, most notably microcephaly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed on Wednesday that a number of infants who died at birth with microcephaly carried traces of Zika in their bloodstream.Microcephaly is a condition in which the unborn child develops a skull too small for his or her brain, causing severe neurological damage. Due to the possibility that the presence of Zika in pregnant mothers may cause microcephaly, the Brazilian government has warned women to avoid getting pregnant until medical experts get the Zika outbreak under control.The Brazilian Christian community has openly rejected calls to expand access to abortions in Brazil over the Zika outbreak. The President of the National Confederation of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB), Sérgio da Rocha, asserted that abortion ""is not an answer"" to Zika. ""We value life in every situation and in any condition in which it arrives,"" he added. ""Having less quality of life does not mean there is no right to live or less human dignity.""""Microcephaly has been occurring in Brazil for years. They are taking advantage of this moment to reintroduce the abortion topic,"" Auxiliary Bishop Leonardo Ulrich Steiner, secretary general of the CNBB, said of the issue, adding that ""abortion leads to eugenics.""Leftist groups have initiated an international push to defy Latin America's strict Catholic support for the right to life. Numerous editorials in left-leaning newspaper have called the refusal to allow abortion in cases of Zika a human rights issue. Planned Parenthood International has launched a fundraising campaign off of the Zika epidemic, asking supporters to donate more money to allow them to better disseminate pro-abortion propaganda in the region.","breitbart","right","16842","zika",725
"Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton told Congress Friday to swiftly approve President Obama's $1.9 billion request to fight the Zika virus at home and abroad, saying the outbreak linked to serious birth defects is ""real,"" ""dangerous"" and threatening U.S. shores.""The president asked for this funding over a month ago, but on Saturday, Congress will begin a two-week break without having allocated one penny,"" the former secretary of state said in a post on Medium.com.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, issued a similar call Friday. In a letter to Speaker Paul D. Ryan, she said Congress should not break for Easter recess until it approves emergency funds to combat Zika, the opioid crisis and the lead-tainted water fiasco in Flint, Michigan.Congressional Republicans say the White House should spend money left over from the Ebola fight before it seeks a massive influx of new money for the Zika fight.Mrs. Clinton lambasted that position in her post, aligning herself with Obama administration officials who've said the Ebola fight isn't over.""Why would we lower our defenses against one public health threat in order to meet another one? That's senseless and dangerous. Congress needs to provide the funds to fight Zika now,"" wrote Mrs. Clinton, who is working to seal her party's nomination over Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont.The rapid spread of Zika virus in Brazil and other Latin America countries has been tied to a sharp uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, or microcephaly.Puerto Rico has reported 259 cases of locally acquired Zika, mainly because its warm climes are hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquito that serves as the virus's primary vector.As of Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 258 cases in travelers who returned from Zika-affected countries to the states, plus five confirmed cases of sexual transmission.Though Zika isn't transmitting locally within the U.S., scientists said that could change once temperatures climb. The Aedes aegypti is found in several southern states, and the more-prevalent Aedes albopictus mosquito is capable of carrying the virus.""Zika is real. It's dangerous,"" Mrs. Clinton said. ""It's already reached the United States. We need to act now to protect people, especially pregnant women. There are smart, achievable things we could be doing right now, and there's no time to waste. So we need Congress to act. We need citizens to demand action."" ","washingtontimes","right","16878","zika",408
"On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case of sexually transmitted Zika virus in the United States, in Dallas County, Texas. The patient -- who contracted the virus from a sexual partner who had recently visited a Zika-afflicted country -- marks the first case of locally acquired Zika in the U.S.The virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   With the high volume of news about the Zika virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps. Here's the latest information you should know as of Wednesday night: Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a health emergency in four Florida counties: Miami-Dade, Lee, Hillsborough and Santa Rosa, the Associated Press reported. So far, there have been nine travel-related cases of Zika virus in the state.While there have been no local transmissions so far, Scott said he wanted Florida to be ready in case the disease does start spreading locally. Because of the state's past dengue and chikungunya outbreaks (spread by the same mosquito that carries Zika virus), health officials and experts have pointed out Florida may be at higher risk than other states for a Zika virus outbreak. DCHHS Reports First #Zika Virus Case in Dallas County Acquired Through Sexual Transmission pic.twitter.com/IMuShm16emThe infection, which occurred when an unnamed Dallas County patient contracted the virus from a sexual partner who had recently returned to the United States from Venezuela, was the first locally acquired infection in the U.S.Weather plays a large role in how Zika virus spreads, because warm temperatures can accelerate a mosquito's life cycle and thus lengthen the amount of time it can carry Zika virus. Hot temps can also make a mosquito hungrier, leading them to bite more people. The Brazilians cities where Zika virus is most widespread also experienced their hottest, driest months to date, notes The Associated Press. Traditional U.S. mosquito eradication methods, such as outdoor pesticide use and fogging, might not work for the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the Zika virus, according to Reuters.Instead health experts say that better eradication methods for the Aedes aegypti mosquito include spraying pesticides indoors -- under beds, on walls and in closets -- in addition to regular garbage collection and the use of screens and air conditioning.Potential blood donors who had visited Mexico, the Caribbean, or Central or South America in the past month should delay their blood donation an additional 28 days, the Red Cross requested. Donors who develop Zika-like symptoms in the two weeks following a donation should notify the Red Cross, so workers can quarantine the blood, Reuters reported. The request is the first of its kind for a mosquito-transmitted disease.There's no known blood test for Zika virus, but the Red Cross stressed that the risk of transmission through blood donation was ""extremely low"" in the continental United States.  The CDC added two new countries -- Jamaica and Tonga -- to its list of destinations with ongoing Zika virus transmission. That makes a total of 30 areas around the world with the local spread of Zika virus, 26 of them in the Americas. Americans traveling to those countries or territories should cover up with long sleeves, pants and mosquito repellant, warns the CDC, and pregnant women are advised to postpone their trip.","huffingtonpost","left","16835","zika",732
"The Peruvian Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani, archbishop of Lima, has blasted the United Nations for encouraging Latin American governments affected by the Zika virus to allow abortion, comparing the organization to a modern-day King Herod, who ordered the slaughter of babies at the time of Jesus' birth.The outspoken cardinal recalled that when Herod heard of the birth of the Messiah ""since he didn't know what to do and was an animal he said 'let's kill all the boys under two years of age,' so they killed all the boys in and around Bethlehem.""""Today we are surrounded by Herods, but Herods with neckties, public posts and budgets,"" he lamented, pointing out that ""the United Nations, in the face of this Zika mosquito virus, has decreed that we should approve abortion everywhere so as to kill the children.""The cardinal was responding to a recent UN appeal that Latin American countries give women access to abortions because of possible ties between the ongoing Zika virus outbreak in the region and the higher-than-normal incidence of microcephaly in Brazilian babies.""How can they ask these women not to become pregnant, but not offer  the possibility to end their pregnancies?"" asked UN Human Rights office spokeswoman Cecile Pouilly.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein was similarly forceful in calling for a relaxation of abortion laws.""The laws and policies that restrict access to these services should be urgently reviewed in accordance with human rights, in order to ensure, in practice, the right to health for all,"" he said.In his weekly radio program, the Peruvian cardinal was having none of it, saying, ""I cannot keep quiet"" in the face of abortion activists pushing for these policies.""There is a Herod,"" he repeated, ""who thinks it's a good idea to decree an execution: let all pregnant women abort their babies because of a risk that hasn't even been conclusively shown. But in case of doubt, kill them all,"" he said.The cardinal said that when something as sacred as human life has been devalued, it is no surprise that ""corruption, insult and assassination"" follow.Recently the Ministry of Health of El Salvador, one of the countries most affected by the Zika epidemic, reported that 13 women infected with the Zika virus had given birth to perfectly healthy babies with no trace of microcephaly.The Washington Post has also noted that Colombia has 3,177 pregnant women who suffered from Zika infections, yet there was not a single reported case of microcephaly.Recent reports suggest that alleged connections between the Zika virus and microcephaly in Brazilian babies may be due more to hype and hysteria than serious science.Only 4% of the 404 cases of microcephaly in Brazil coincided with Zika infections, meaning that there must be another cause or causes to explain the higher incidence of children born with microcephaly in the country.The tenuous ties between Zika and microcephaly have not stopped abortion activists like Planned Parenthood from trying to exploit the crisis to push Latin American governments to remove all restrictions on abortion.""It's amazing how fast they have acted, not decreeing a campaign, economic aid or an investigation,"" Cardinal Cipriani said in his broadcast, ""but rather that all Latin American countries allow abortion to combat this danger,"" he said.""We really have to be sick at heart to do such a thing,"" he added.Follow Thomas D.

"Zika arrives in Ireland, with confirmation from the Health Service Executive that two travelers with a history of visiting the South American outbreak area have tested positive for the virus.According to the BBC, the patients are a man and an older woman.

"By Julia Symmes CobbBOGOTA (Reuters) - More than 3,100 pregnant Colombian women are infected with the mosquito-borne Zika virus, President Juan Manuel Santos said on Saturday, as the disease continues its rapid spread across the Americas.Brazil is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly, a birth defect marked by an abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems. Researchers have identified evidence of Zika infection in 17 of these cases, either in the baby or in the mother, but have not confirmed that Zika can cause microcephaly.There are so far no recorded cases of Zika-linked microcephaly in Colombia, Santos said. The government is now uncertain about a previous projection for up to 500 cases of Zika-linked microcephaly, based on data from other countries battling the disease, he said.Much remains unknown about Zika, for which there is no vaccine. An estimated 80 percent of those infected show no symptoms, and those that do have a mild illness, with a fever, rash and red eyes.There are 25,645 people infected with Zika in Colombia, Santos said during a TV broadcast with health officials. Among them are 3,177 pregnant women.""The projection is that we could end up having 600,000 cases,"" Santos said, adding there could be up to 1,000 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can weaken the muscles and cause paralysis. Scientists are studying a possible link between the disorder and Zika.The Colombian government will be working across the country to fight mosquitoes - fumigating and helping families rid their homes of stagnant water, the president said.The province of Norte de Santander, along the eastern border with Venezuela, had nearly 5,000 Zika cases, the highest in the country, an epidemiological bulletin from the national health institute published on Saturday showed. That province also had the highest number of pregnantwomen with Zika - nearly 31 percent of total cases.Colombia's Caribbean region, which includes popular tourist destinations Cartagena and Santa Marta, had more than 11,000 cases of the virus, according to the bulletin.The government has said pregnant women with Zika are eligible to access much-restricted abortion services.Many women struggle to find abortion providers even when they meet strict legal requirements and illegal abortions are widespread. On Friday, local media reported the first abortion because of Zika infection.Colombia's health minister, Alejandro Gaviria, has said he believes three deaths are connected with Zika.(Reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Nick Zieminski)","huffingtonpost","left","16838","zika",431
"Everything seems scarier during the dark of night than in the light of day. That is a likely explanation for why the public hit the panic button when the Zika virus made headlines this year. Zika, which is currently under intense investigation because of concerns that it might cause pregnant women to miscarry or deliver babies with abnormally small brains, is spreading wildly in Latin America, with four million cases expected within the next year. It was declared an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization this past winter and in the last several months there have been Zika virus infections diagnosed in the U.S., mainly in travelers from out of the country. Zika poses a real, but relatively small, risk to most Americans. But because the risk itself cannot be quantified precisely, and no doctor can assure you with 100 percent certainty that you will be fine, we remain concerned, especially as the summer months approach and mosquitoes -- major Zika transmitters -- are out in large numbers. Clearly, pregnant women should avoid traveling to countries experiencing Zika outbreaks. If for some reason they must travel to those locales, it is critical that they minimize outdoor activity, use insect repellents that are safe for pregnant women and consult with physicians if they experience the virus symptoms, which include fever, rash, headache, joint pain and conjunctivitis. As doctors and researchers learn more about Zika, the ever-changing information is causing further alarm. A few months ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that blood was free of infection one week after contracting Zika, an estimate that later revised to one month, and, as of today, the website says eight weeks. The Zika virus, which can be transmitted sexually as well as through mosquito bites, persists in semen longer than in blood. And although we know that we must watch out if men contract the virus, we do not know how many Zika infections are transmitted through semen rather than mosquitoes. It's thought to be very few, but the true number of cases that are sexually transmitted is simply uncertain.So if the medical experts are still learning about the virus, how is the public supposed to know how to react? This is the point where well-educated health care professionals play a vital role.People need to remember that there are no guarantees in life and know that health care professionals are there to help. Every day we all make a million decisions based on uncertainty and incomplete information. We balance the risks and benefits and take the plunge, making the choice that we feel is best for each of us with the information available at the time. Take the popular WAZE app. Which road to take to avoid traffic can be a moving target, but we look at WAZE and we go for it.  WAZE crowdsources data from multiple sources and computes the average time it will take to get from point A to point B, keeping track of the various factors and information at any given point. It suggests the best solution based on what is known. Yet, by the time you're en route, there might be a new accident or road hazard that hasn't yet been factored in to the system. It is an apt metaphor for what health care professionals can do for you in a time of public health crisis.As president of a university that is a leading national educator of health care professionals, I can tell you that we train our students to acquire the skills necessary to absorb all the scientific information that is available, and then translate it into solutions to help patients navigate their way through a world filled with uncertainty. Evaluating the risk-benefit ratio of any intervention or behavior is a technique that all health care professionals learn during training, and one that everyone needs to master. Unlike the news media, whose job it is to report all the information that is known at press time, the job of health care professionals is to analyze that information and help individual patients decide what course of action is right for themselves and their families. Each of us has our own tolerance for risk and there is no single answer that is right for everyone. But even with the best information that we have available, there are questions to which we do not have adequate data to answer. Whether to travel to Zika-infected areas -- such as the summer Olympics in Rio -- is one of them. For women who are pregnant, the answer seems clear: Skip it. For the rest of us, the ""correct"" answer is unknown. Because although our personal risk may be low, it is possible that we will transmit the disease to others on our return. Uncertainty will always be part of life and there are so few absolutes. And yet, everyone should have a trusted and competent health care professional to help find solutions. It may be scary in the dark, but your doctor can light a candle.","huffingtonpost","left","16980","zika",862
"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) complained this week that his district isn't getting enough federal grant money to combat the Zika virus from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the same agency he's repeatedly voted to underfund as it tries to prevent an outbreak.""We are vulnerable to the threat of Zika virus for several reasons,"" Poe said in a statement on Tuesday, referencing a letter he recently sent to the CDC. ""Both mosquito vectors that carry Zika virus are present in Harris County. Located on the Gulf Coast, we have experienced high flood waters in recent months. In addition, there are also areas of our community that are poverty stricken. Each of these factors create conditions that are ideal for mosquitoes to breed.""""The CDC must work with our community both now and in the future to address this flawed grant system and help allocate federal dollars for Harris County's public health response,"" he added.But Poe was among those who voted last month to give the CDC just one-third of the $1.9 billion it requested to protect the public from a Zika outbreak. The bill he voted for, which came three months after the CDC asked for aid, also provided just one-fifth the amount the agency requested for its overall public health activities.Beyond that, the Texas congressman has voted six times to block the full $1.9 billion in emergency resources for Zika. Those votes were tied to his support for the GOP's transportation and housing spending bill; a chemical regulation bill; a separate Zika funding bill; a defense spending bill; a scholarship reauthorization bill; and a bill related to privacy for angel investors.For good measure, Poe also voted against letting Washington D.C. use local funds to combat Zika.A spokeswoman for Poe did not respond to a request for comment.Neither the House nor the Senate fully funded the CDC's request. House Republicans passed their bill to give the agency $622 million, while the Senate passed a $1.1 billion bill. They'll be hashing out the differences between their two bills in the coming weeks.The CDC has activated a Level 1 response to a possible Zika outbreak, the highest response level at the agency. Top public health officials warned in April that the mosquito-borne virus is ""scarier than we initially thought,"" and CDC Director Tom Frieden made an emotional plea to Congress last month to fully fund the prevention efforts.""Imagine that you're standing by and you see someone drowning, and you have the ability to stop them from drowning, but you can't,"" Frieden said at a National Press Club event. ""Now, multiply that by 1,000 or 100,000. That's what it feels like to know how to change the course of an epidemic and not be able to do it.""The lifetime cost of care for just one baby with microcephaly, the birth defect caused by the Zika virus, is estimated at as much as $10 million.","huffingtonpost","left","16962","zika",512
"Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) expressed concerns that Zika-carrying mosquitoes could bring the virus from Mexico into the United States.""It certainly would not be a surprise at all if we see some locally transmitted cases of Zika in Texas,"" said Chris Van Deusen, spokesman for the TDSHS, the Brownsville Herald reported Sunday, April 17.Zika is a virus spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. Although considered mild for most who contract the illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded the virus was a threat to pregnant women as ""a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects."" They continue to warn pregnant women to avoid travel to Zika affected countries. The virus is also linked to increased risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome, rare paralysis disease.Reportedly, local Aedes aegypti mosquitoes transmit the virus in Mexico. The TDSHS spokesman commented that this type of mosquito exists in southeast Texas, along the Gulf coast and a few other pockets within the state. The CDC also lists another mosquito type, the Aedes albopictus, as a carrier.In January, Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, voiced concern that the Texas Gulf Coast could be ""hardest hit' in a Zika outbreak since the virus is spread by Aedes mosquitoes that also carry Dengue fever, prevalent on the Texas-Mexico border, and Chikungunya, which first entered the Lone Star State in 2014, with more cases last year, Breitbart Texas reported. These Zika-carrying mosquitoes like to reproduce in standing water close to humans. Hotez cited Houston's economically depressed areas as prime breeding grounds.Van Deusen noted: ""What we still expect is that we may well see a pattern that's something like we see with Dengue fever. Zika and Dengue are very similar viruses.""According to the Brownsville newspaper, the TDSHS spokesman explained that when a big Dengue epidemic occurs across the border in areas such as Tamaulipas, Mexico, officials do see some locally transmitted Dengue cases in the Rio Grande Valley. He hypothesized this could be the case for Zika-carrying mosquitoes and not a situation where the virus will be ""widespread."" Van Deusen noted: "" obviously we want to delay cases like that or prevent it altogether.""The CDC confirmed local mosquito transmission of the Zika virus in Mexico. By definition, that means mosquitoes native to the region are infected with Zika and spread it to people. On April 14, Mexican health officials confirmed 222 Zika cases of which 53 were pregnant women, seven who were not affected by the virus. Mexico continues to monitor ongoing pregnancies for microcephaly through ultrasound, testing available to pregnant women in 51 hospitals across 32 states.Travel magazine Baja Insider reported while no reported cases of Zika virus have been recorded in Baja California or Baja California Sur, to date, those reported occurred in Chiapas, Oaxaca, Nuevo Leon, Guererro, Jalisco, Michoacán, Veracruz,Nayarit, Sinoloa, Tabasco Veracruz, and Yucatan. As reported by the Herald, Van Deusen doesn't believe the virus has reached all parts of Mexico.In January, Van Deusen commented that they are monitoring the illness because of the likelihood it could spread further, indicating their biggest concern is for those traveling to high risk areas and bringing the virus back with them into Texas.Mary Suzanne Whitworth, M.D. medical director of Infectious Diseases at Cook Children's, recently addressed the CDC's concern that Zika virus is ""a bit scarier than we initially thought."" Whitworth was concerned that that this news would fuel fears about Zika. She highlighted that, to date, Zika transmission from local mosquitoes in the U.S. has not occurred and all cases originated with individuals who traveled to Zika infested regions and became infected through a mosquito bite.However, Zika is now known to be a sexually transmitted disease. The first cases of infection through male-to-female vaginal intercourse and through male-to-male anal sex were diagnosed in Dallas.Whitworth stated the reason why mosquito-borne illnesses have not spread as much in the United States is likely improved mosquito vector control and air conditioning. More people remain inside more and don't sleep with open windows receiving less exposure to the winged insect. Preventative measures like wearing insect repellent play a significant role.According to the Brownsville newspaper, no local mosquitoes in Cameron County have been found to carry Zika, virus, although they note that TDSHS does not know if Zika will be a bigger issue than originally believed.""We want people to protect themselves so that they don't bring the virus back and introduce it to mosquitoes here,"" Van Deusen said. ""Of course, we recommend that people protect themselves from mosquito bites here as well."" on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16911","zika",792
"Before becoming racked with fear over the Zika virus (a flavivirus, which for the most part, have arthropod vectors, e.g., mosquitoes) we may want to take our time and explore this emerging story in depth, as the fear mongering has begun. First, it is important to ask questions. Asking questions is NOT an avenue toward conspiracy theorizing, but thinking. During my studies as an MPH student, at Yale University's School of Public Health, followed by the acquisition of my Doctorate, in Community Health Education, from Columbia University Teachers College, I was taught to question everything, from an epidemiological vantage point and beyond, in terms of diseases.  Beyond educational training/research, there is also common sense that leads to inquiry. FactsThe Zika virus is not new as it was identified in 1947. Microcephaly (in this instance, referring specifically to babies born with small heads) is also not new. According to a recent article in the New York Times, ""An estimated 25,000 babies receive a microcephaly diagnosis each year in the United States. Microcephaly simply means that the baby's head is abnormally small -- sometimes just because the parents themselves have unusually small heads."" This fact is shared, from my perspective, with deep compassion for the babies, mothers, parents and families dealing with this issue. GeographyThe Zika virus has been in the Pacific Islands, and other parts of the world, as we are being told, before now. The question is, where are all the babies with microcephaly in the Pacific Islands? ""Other regions that have experienced recent Zika outbreaks -- mostly Pacific islands -- have not reported an increase in microcephaly."" Furthermore, ""How many cases of microcephaly in Brazil have actually been linked to the Zika virus? Of the nearly 4,200 cases reported, only six have been linked with certainty to the virus,"" per NPR.Causal RelationshipsAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke:""Microcephaly can be present at birth or it may develop in the first few years of life. It is associated with Down's syndrome, chromosomal syndromes, and neurometabolic syndromes. Babies may also be born with microcephaly if, during pregnancy, their mother abused drugs or alcohol, became infected with a cytomegalovirus, rubella (German measles), or varicella (chicken pox) virus, was exposed to certain toxic chemicals or had untreated phenylketonuria (PKU)."" Sexual TransmissionAs for sexual transmission of the Zika virus, which has surfaced in recent discussions as a possibility, there are only two cases that are questionable. There is also one new case of purported sexual transmission recently reported (see # 4 below).Therefore, the bottom line is that before fear and hysteria set in regarding the Zika virus, the following key questions should be asked:Identification1. If the Zika virus was identified in 1947, were there a significant number of cases of microcephaly then and beyond, before current stories, and if not why?Correlation and Causation2.   Are all of the cases of microcephaly currently in Brazil, and other locations in current stories, directly correlated with the Zika virus?  If not, how many and is the number significant enough to establish positive correlation and hence, causation?Evidence3. Is it a proven fact, that the Zika virus, in general, causes microcephaly with specific, established, scientific, documented evidence?Sexual Transmission4. Is the Zika virus sexually transmitted and if so, what is the determination of such, beyond two cases that may establish this as a possibility? One case of sexual transmission has now been identified in the U.S.  If the Zika virus can be sexually transmitted and was identified in 1947, it would seem that there would be more than three cases.Other Possible Causes5.  Have all other possible causes, as indicated by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke mentioned above, been ruled out?Asking questions about the Zika virus at this point is critical.  There is no reason not to ask questions before accepting the hype.","huffingtonpost","left","16834","zika",663
"The first case of Zika virus was confirmed in Los Angles County on Tuesday within days of a warning from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) that predicted the spread of the virus throughout the Americas.A young Los Angeles County girl traveled to El Salvador last November, where county health officials suspect she contracted the disease, according to the Los Angeles Times. Zika infections usually do not have symptoms-but that is part of the worry say health experts.Despite a lack of symptoms, the mosquito-born virus has been linked to severe birth defects. The Times reported that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned pregnant women to avoid Zika-affected regions. A Brazilian mother recounted the discovery of her son's severe ""small head,"" a birth defect called microcephaly: ""It was only after he was born and swiftly taken away from me for emergency treatment that we understood that it was Zika.""""Zika virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito from the Aedes genus, mainly Aedes aegypti in tropical regions. This is the same mosquito that transmits dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever,"" according to the World Health Organization.""PAHO [the Pan-American Health Organization] anticipates that Zika virus will continue to spread and will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found,"" according to a PAHO/WHO statement issued this week. Chile and Canada are the only two North American countries exempt from Zika warnings due to the absence of Aedes mosquitos.Dangers from non-native mosquitos carrying diseases like dengue fever, chikungunya and yellow fever have been on the minds of California health officials. Last October warnings were put in place for the Asian tiger (Aedes albopictus) and yellow fever (Aedes aegypti) mosquitos.Three cases of Zika have been documented in New York as well. Just one patient has fully recovered.Texas officials have reported multiple cases of Chikungunya illustrating the potential of similarly spread diseases coming to America. Celebrity Lindsay Lohan contracted Chikungunya while on vacation in Bora Bora, and in January ended up hospitalized in London. on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16827","zika",364
"Despite a decade of lessons learned from fighting global health disasters like avian flu, SARS, and most recently Ebola, the United States continues to use an ineffective 'crisis-by-crisis' approach to combat health emergencies. With the Zika virus now challenging domestic and international health care infrastructures, we need a comprehensive playbook to address these global health pandemics and ensure global health security for future generations. Detecting, preventing, and responding to Zika will require accelerated research, investments in surveillance systems, and expanded mosquito control, among other activities. But every day we wait to provide the emergency funding necessary to combat Zika is a day closer to the heat of summer when mosquitos begin their blood-searching quest. Every day we wait, Americans are more vulnerable to contracting the virus without a clear national strategy to eradicate the threat.During the Ebola outbreak, more people were infected and died from the virus than should have because the international community failed to quickly identify and respond to the deadly epidemic.  Health systems buckled under the pressure of inadequate resources or knowledge of how to track and treat the disease. American leadership was instrumental in helping to stop the spread of the disease thanks to $5.4 billion in emergency funding but this was a temporary solution when America and the rest of the world deserve a lasting one.Unlike the two cases of Ebola that were transmitted on American soil, active Zika transmission is on the verge of exploding across America.  Although Zika was historically considered a benign virus resulting in mild flu-like symptoms, recent investigations have discovered the alarming connection between the virus and the development of microcephaly, in which an infant is born with a much smaller head size and an underdeveloped brain.  Researchers also suspect Zika will make people of all ages more susceptible to developing the autoimmune disorder Guillian-Barré Syndrome, which can cause partial or full paralysis and other neurological issues.  Increased incidence of microcephaly or Guillian-Barré will not only devastate individual families, it will also put significant strain on the long-term the health care, education, and social services systems of our nation. As of early May, there are 503 cases of Zika in the United States,  all of which were acquired after travel to an area with active Zika transmission or by a partner who was infected. There is not time to delay the development of a comprehensive strategy to fight this virus, and do so in a manner that establishes a foundation for future protocol against emerging health care threats. That is why I encouraged the administration to designate a single White House level appointee to coordinate the U.S. policy and interagency Zika effort and liaise with international and domestic partners in the face of this pandemic. The appointment of Ron Klain to coordinate all federal efforts to combat the Ebola crisis was an important success and is effective model to replicate. Such leadership would organize the logistical framework that is necessary to successfully analyze the risk of disease infection, outline the necessary resources, and request timely action by lawmakers about any additional funding needs. This week, I queried the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency about the country's health care system capacity to prepare for and respond to active Zika transmission on American soil. In my letters, I specifically ask for more information about the use of genetically modified mosquitoes as a potential strategy to reduce Zika virus transmission and the concerns that remain about the effectiveness and safety of the technology.The international community is once again calling for a united front to a new global health threat. We need to put in place a system that can rapidly mobilize against infectious diseases instead of relying on a fragmented, reactive approach each time a crisis appears. Our lack of an immediate financial response to Zika has already left us at a disadvantage against the inevitable infiltration of the virus here in America. But it's not too late to build a cohesive plan that establishes a permanent system and protocols for when the next health crisis emerges.Let's appoint a single entity to coordinate a U.S. response to health care epidemics. Let's build a national strategy against communicable diseases by investing in our agencies with the capacity to develop tests, vaccine candidates, and educational tools. Let's strengthen communication and collaboration with our international partners so that we truly are ready to detect, prevent, and respond to Zika and the next threat. Let us not wait until the next global health crisis to develop a lasting solution that reinforces global health security for decades to come.","huffingtonpost","left","16934","zika",797
"As director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, my job is to protect our nation's health. As a husband and father, my family's health and safety is always foremost on my mind. Zika virus, and the birth defects it can cause, is a new and scary threat -- one that can have a significant impact on families.Although scientists and doctors at CDC and elsewhere are still learning about Zika, we know some important things about the virus and how it spreads. We've also learned that Zika infection is of greatest concern for pregnant women because it can cause serious birth defects, such as microcephaly. Any man returning from an area with Zika needs to take two important steps to protect his partner, his children, and his community.First, protect your partner's pregnancy. Although Zika is primarily spread by mosquitoes, a man with Zika can pass it to his sexual partner. If your partner is pregnant, you can help protect her health and the health of the fetus by using condoms every time you have sex. If you and your partner are considering pregnancy, we recommend waiting at least 2 months after you get back from a Zika-affected area if you don't have symptoms, and at least 6 months if you do have symptoms.Second, if you live in an area with mosquitoes that can spread Zika, protect your family and community. After returning from an area with Zika, prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so you do not spread Zika to local mosquitoes. These mosquitoes could, in turn, spread the virus to your family, friends, and other nearby people. Wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants and using EPA-registered insect repellent are important to prevent bites. Keep the number of mosquitoes around your home down by getting rid of any standing water where mosquitoes can breed.

"If President Obama needs more money to fight the Zika virus, he will have to find it by cutting elsewhere in the federal budget, House conservatives said Wednesday, laying down a marker as Congress increasingly clashes with the administration over spending requests.Influential members of the House Republican conference said there is plenty of waste in faulty reconstruction projects in Afghanistan or in Social Security payments to dead people that could be cut, rather than tacking Zika money onto the deficit.""I'm just going to be reluctant to vote for increased spending without it being offset,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican and a member of the House Freedom Caucus that has frequently sparred with GOP leadership.Mr. Obama is requesting $1.9 billion to find a better diagnostic test and a vaccine for Zika and to control the pesky mosquitoes that carry the virus.Congressional Democrats have taken up Mr. Obama's call, insisting that Congress is inviting trouble by not doing more to fight the virus ahead of a potential summer outbreak in the U.S.But conservatives said Mr. Obama has already shifted money and should do more of that rather than asking taxpayers to pay more now.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded nearly 400 travel-related cases of Zika in the states and the District of Columbia, including some instance of sexual transmission, but officials say the virus will spread on its own with the proliferation of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes this summer.""You can't build a fence to keep them out, and the mosquitoes won't pay for it,"" said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, Maryland Democrat, alluding to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's plan to deal with illegal immigration along the southern U.S. border.Democrats say the Zika threat is similar to wars and hurricanes, where Congress routinely tacks the costs onto the deficit rather than searching for offsets to pay for them.""If this is not an emergency, there's nothing that is - no flood, no earthquake, no fire,"" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat. ""We should have no offset.""The standoff joins other fights over money to help Flint, Michigan, recover from its water crisis and to spend more on federal efforts against the emerging opioid drug abuse epidemic.In each of those cases, Democrats say more federal money is needed, while Republicans are conflicted. Democrats say Congress needs to pass an emergency spending bill to cover a host of immediate needs.The battle is playing out even as Congress tries to write its 2017 spending bills.On Wednesday, Senate Democrats mounted a filibuster to halt the first of the dozen annual bills. Democrats objected to having to vote on an amendment to the water and energy bill that would halt Mr. Obama's plans to buy heavy water from Iran, in an effort to bolster the nuclear deal between the international community and the regime in Tehran.""No matter what the issue, there is some new and creative way to try to throw a monkey wrench in the gears,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who insisted that passing the spending bills would be proof that Congress can operate under GOP control.Democratic leaders, though, said Mr. Obama would veto the bill if it tries to stop any part of his Iran deal. Given that, Democrats said, it makes no sense to even debate or vote on the heavy-water proposal. ","washingtontimes","right","16918","zika",574
"His comments about Donald Trump's faith have become headlines news around the world, but Pope Francis said something else on his flight back from Mexico to Rome on Thursday.""Avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil,"" the Pope has been quoted as telling reporters in his airborne news conference. Pope Francis went on to mention the exception dispensation one of his predecessors, Pope Paul VI, issued to Catholic nuns to take birth control pills when there were at potential risk of rape. This is not the first time the Pope has used an impromptu inflight interview to range over the issue of family planning. Coming back from a visit to the Philippines last year he reportedly spoke about the ""irresponsibility"" of people breeding ""like rabbits.""But this time he was returning from a region where the Zika virus is having a devastating impact, where women are being advised not to become pregnant in light of the potential link between the virus and an increase in microcephaly among new born babies.Yet these same women face huge difficulties in accessing reliable methods of contraception, in a region where the Catholic Church, a steady opponent of reliable contraception, has great authority.IPPF estimates that in Latin America and the Caribbean, 23 million women have an unmet need for contraception and account for 75 percent of unintended pregnancies in the region.Latin America is also home to some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world. Here the Pope offered no sign of movement in his comments, calling abortion an ""absolute evil."" But we know women in South America risk their lives every day to obtain back-alley abortions, with 95 percent of abortions in the region performed in unsafe conditions.Despite opposition, in recent decades, Latin America has made great strides in amplifying access to contraception. However, much more needs to be done. In the face of Zika, these gains need to be echoed throughout the region -- especially for adolescents, poor women and those living in rural areas who are most likely to be exposed to the virus and least likely to have access to reproductive health services.A subtle change in the teachings of the Catholic Church might help to improve this situation. But we should not waste time on interpretation. Latin American governments are in charge of Latin America. They already possess the authority needed to fight Zika through better access to contraception and safe abortion, as well as anti-mosquito measures.IPPF urges them to do so.","huffingtonpost","left","16853","zika",435
"Virologist Gubio Soares, who first identified the presence of the pervasive Zika virus in Brazil, suggested that legalized abortion in French Polynesia may have prevented scientists from uncovering a link between Zika and severe infant deformities sooner.During a lecture, Soares claimed scientists do not know for sure if a link exists between Zika and microcephaly. This is mainly because women in places where Zika breeds often aborted children who showed signs of microcephaly, a disorder now linked to the virus. Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.""It is necessary to review the number of abortions in French Polynesia,"" he stressed.Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which causes small skulls in infants that cannot hold the brain. This leads to serious mental disabilities.Planned Parenthood and leftist politicians have argued that easier access to abortion will help contain the damage the Zika virus is causing in Latin America.""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,"" wrote sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy in the O Globo.One Brazilian judge announced he will grant Zika-infected women abortions if they can prove their unborn child has microcephaly. He insisted these abortions are ""valid"" if reports prove the child will ""be born dead"" or ""life after birth is impossible."" He will require at least three separate medical records to reach his decision.The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the outbreak of Zika, however, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases compared to the 147 in 2014.Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia have advised women not to get pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.Giselle Carino, deputy director for the International Planned Parenthood Federation's (IPPF) Western Hemisphere Region, called the move ""insufficient at best"" and ""needs to be more comprehensive.""Doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester or after birth:The National Institutes of Health confirmed that the Zika virus outbreak has reached pandemic levels in Latin America.""You have multiple countries in South America and in the Caribbean, so by anybody's definition that would be considered a pandemic,"" explained Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases branch at the institute.His comments come after experts and the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the disease had ""explosive pandemic potential."" Marcos Espinal, head of Communicable Diseases and Health Analysis for the WHO's regional satellite, the Pan American Health Organization, predicted the world could see ""3 to 4 million cases of Zika virus disease.""Doctors in the U.S. have confirmed at least 31 Zika cases.""If you have this much Zika in South America and the Caribbean, sooner or later we're going to see a local transmission,"" continued Fauci.

"After talking with experts, President Obama asked for $1.8B. Congress still isn't close.Republicans have been intent on either ignoring the threat of the Zika virus or providing an insufficient level of funding by stealing from funds already allocated for other health issues, like stopping Ebola. Now it looks like they're still intent on leaving Ebola to smolder, but at least are about to change their minds when it comes to providing some additional funds.The financing, which is being considered by some members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, would supplement the $510 million the Obama administration recently redirected from fighting Ebola toward Zika, as congressional Republicans had urged.Several Republicans are still playing dumb (not exactly a stretch) and pretending that they're waiting on more information before acting. Others are still refusing to cough up any additional money, despite being aware of the looming threat. Still, it looks like one of those rare bipartisan compromises might be in the offing.Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Health and Human Services appropriations subcommittee who has been involved in the discussions, said lawmakers were working to reach an agreement that would address Zika, which has been linked to serious birth defects.So now, all that has to happen is for Zika to only come in at the lower end of its predicted impact, for Ebola to not flare up while we're not providing any funds, and Congress to actually get its act together and reach agreement. Don't read any doom in that. Nope.","dailykos","left","16912","zika",255
"Media outlets in Venezuela are reporting that at least eleven patients nationwide have died of Guillain-Barré syndrome, though the government's Health Ministry has yet to report any of the cases, and most appear linked to the Zika virus pandemic ravaging Latin America.El Nacional reports that these eleven deaths have been recorded throughout Venezuela, but the national Health Ministry ""has yet to admit any deaths"" related to the Zika virus. All eleven died of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a condition in which the body's immune system turns on its nervous system, causing severe joint and muscle pain.The latest death, in Maracay, was that of a 38-year-old man who did not have access to treatment for the syndrome. ""Neither of the two known treatments were available to him: there is a shortage of immunoglobulin to apply intravenously [and] human albumin as an alternative therapy."" Venezuelan authorities told the newspaper that 90 percent of known cases nationwide of Guillain-Barré involve patients with hypertension or diabetes, dismissing Zika as a potential reason for the surge in cases. Last week, however, they told Reuters that there were at least 255 cases of the syndrome suspected of having ties to Zika.José Félix Oletta, who works with the NGO Let's Defend Epidemiology Network, tells Venezuela outlet La Patilla that their data collection suggests that currently, over 3,000 patients in Venezuela have Guillain-Barré.Reuters has found at least one case of a man who was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré after exhibiting symptoms of carrying the Zika virus. Roberto Miguez's face is paralyzed, and he is bedridden, according to his sister. This follows complaints of symptoms similar to Zika. The family has been waiting for days for immunoglobulin to commence treatment, but have yet to receive any indication that they will find it within the nation's borders. Reuters notes that the only domestic manufacturer of immunoglobulin has not  produced it since August.""Delaying treatment can result in profound neurologic damage including paralysis of the face, arms and legs, loss of sensation in the extremities and respiratory failure requiring intubation and admission to an intensive care unit for a prolonged period (weeks to months),"" Carlo Tornatore, professor of Neurology at Georgetown University School of Medicine, tells Reuters.""The national government must accept we are in a humanitarian crisis in the health sector, with patients dying across our territory for lack of medicines,"" Freddy Ceballos, the president of Venezuela's Pharmaceutical Federation, said in January. The Federation published a report indicating that up to 85 percent of the nation's pharmacies would be forced to close due to medical shortages, and that a list of over 150 medications - from common painkillers to advance cancer medication - were nowhere to be found in Venezuela. To make due, some pharmacies had begun selling veterinary medicine to human patients.In addition to the severe medical shortages plaguing Venezuela, international observers have protested that the socialist government is not properly monitoring cases of Zika in the country. Colombian Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria accused Venezuelan officials of having ""no systematic reporting of the data"" on the Zika outbreak in the Caribbean nation, calling it a ""serious problem"" this week.The Venezuelan government claims it is monitoring Zika cases, but has documented significantly fewer cases than its neighbors. According to the Venezuelan Health Ministry, the nation has diagnosed 4,700 cases of Zika, compared to over 20,000 in Colombia and 1.5 million in Brazil. Reuters notes the real number of Zika cases in Venezuela is estimated to be closer to the 240,000-500,000 range.The Venezuelan government has begun Zika awareness campaigns, but none highlight the need for more generalized access to medication. On its official state-run media site, the government boasts of the ""National Integral Plan Against Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya"" (all spread by the same species of mosquito), which involves ""the collection of waste, garbage, and rubble, to later proceed with fumigation.""","breitbart","right","16835","zika",642
"The executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) asserts that a lifting of the ban on DDT could prevent the spread of the Zika virus, just as it could have wiped out malaria.Dr. Jane Orient tells Breitbart News the major public health measure required to combat the Zika virus pandemic is mosquito control and says, ""DDT was the most effective public health weapon of all time.""Orient continues:""Substitute pesticides are far more toxic and expensive,"" she adds. ""People are advised to use insect repellents such as DEET - which is absorbed through the skin, and safety in pregnancy is not established.""Orient's view is shared by president of Pioneer Energy Dr. Robert Zubrin, who recently wrote at National Review, ""The most effective pesticide is DDT. If the Zika catastrophe is to be prevented in time, we need to use it.""Zubrin observes the pesticide's history:Zubrin asserts that environmentalists such as Rachel Carson, author of the 1962 book Silent Spring, propagated the notion that DDT was harmful to bird populations.""This was false,"" he writes. ""In fact, by eliminating their insect parasites and infection agents, DDT was helping bird numbers to grow significantly.""Nevertheless, Zubrin notes environmentalists launched an aggressive ""massive propaganda campaign"" that would ultimately ban the use of DDT.According to Orient, Zika is not a new virus, having been first identified in humans in 1947 in Uganda's Zika Forest. Nevertheless, CDC director Thomas Frieden observes the virus's association with microcephaly and other fetal harm.""There is no definitive proof that ZVD has caused birth defects,"" Orient notes. ""In fact, the evidence is against it. In Colombia, 3000 pregnant women had ZVD - with no microcephaly. In Brazil, only 17 of 404 cases of confirmed microcephaly were positive for ZVD. ZVD has been known since the 1940s as a benign disease, with no reported birth defects.""Orient also advises against exposing women who may be pregnant to drugs or vaccines that have not been through thorough safety testing. She notes that, last year, Brazil mandated the pertussis vaccine for all pregnant women - without proof of safety during pregnancy.Regarding the fear that Zika could spread through the United States via illegal immigrants, Orient believes that ZVD is perhaps one of the least important of the kinds of diseases that could be transmitted in that way. A concern she has is that President Obama proposes to spend $1.8 billion on the ZVD threat - which is now being used politically to promote abortion in countries where it is currently illegal - while ""other genuine threats proliferate.""""We could stop transmission now with effective mosquito control in affected areas,"" Orient says.","breitbart","right","16840","zika",441
"MATAMOROS, Tamaulipas - Mexican border businessmen fear that the Zika virus could continue to spread in Mexico and end up damaging the already fragile border economy.Public health officials in this Mexican border city have to coordinate their contingency protocols with their counterparts in Texas to analyze the threat that the Zika could present to the region, said Osvaldo Castillo Hernandez, the president of the National Chamber of Commerce in Matamoros (Matamoros CANACO).The fear among business leaders in the area is that the number of cases could continue to rise particularly in border areas, which sees a regular influx of travelers. One of the concerns expressed by business leaders is that public health officials will not address the issue accordingly and in a timely manner. As previously reported by Breitbart Texas, Mexico currently has 37 confirmed cases of Zika with one of those cases being a man from the border city of Reynosa who had recently traveled to Colombia where he was likely infected. ""We can not let our guard down in matters of public health, either with this virus or another one, particularly when the way it spreads is through an insect that has already been linked to the spread of other illnesses,"" Castillo said. The spread of a virus like the Zika could be catastrophic to border regions similar to the economic downturn caused by the H1N1 flu, Castillo said. ""Authorities can not take this matter lightly, they have to respond to the demands being made by the public,"" the CANACO leader said as he made a formal request to the Tamaulipas government. In Tamaulipas, once again, the government claims to have everything under control. However, as we have seen in the past, there have been situations where what was once ""under control"" has gotten out of control, he said.""This is a situation where only a rumor of an outbreak can have a catastrophic effect,"" Castillo said.

"A group of doctors in Argentina calling themselves the ""Physicians in Crop-Sprayed Towns"" have issued an explosive report that denies global scientific consensus on the Zika virus outbreak and its apparent link to an uptick in cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil.The doctors allege that instead of the mild mosquito-borne Zika virus, the increase in microcephaly cases is caused by a larvicide that contains the chemical pyriproxyfen. This larvicide is employed in mosquito control efforts against the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the type that can carry Zika, including using it to kill eggs in public water supplies. Since its release on Feb. 3, the doctor's 6-page report has spread like wildfire across the Internet, first cropping up in news sites run by GMO and environmental watchdogs and then finding mainstream coverage in outlets like the U.K.'s Telegraph and the New York-based Tech Times. Even actor George Takei shared the story, garnering about 25,000 Facebook likes and almost as many shares. Not only does the report convey inaccurate information about Zika virus' history and speculate about the timetables of microcephaly cases and the use of the larvicide in water treatment, but it ends in a diatribe against other types of mosquito control efforts. Given the clear need for mosquito control to prevent further illnesses -- and not just Zika, but also dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever -- this isn't just ill-conceived, it's actually dangerous. ""The effect of this [report] to cause panic in people, and to prevent an effective response to disease carrying-vectors, is a very substantial negative,"" said Ian Musgrave, an expert on neurotoxicology and pharmacology at the University of Adelaide. ""If they wanted to control the mosquitos, what are they going to use now? Something even more toxic?""The report is having a real effect on the ground, too: Though the Brazilian government dismissed claims of a relationship between pyriproxyfen and microcephaly, at least one state in Brazil has already suspended its use. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, spoke out against the ""sketchy"" report, reports the Wall Street journal, as did Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""The mistake is not the position against or in favor of the larvicide, but to insist in causal inferences without evidence,"" added Ligia Bahia, a public health expert at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro who also took issue with the distraction the report poses from the real threat of Zika virus. Here are five inconvenient truths that refute this viral report. Musgrave called the claims that pyriproxyfen causes microcephaly ""simply not plausible.""Musgrave, who has no ties to pyriproxyfen manufacturers, financial or otherwise, points out that pyriproxyfen is so mild that it has been used as a pesticide in tick and flea collars for pets for years. An adult human would have to eat a teaspoon of raw pesticide to be poisoned by the chemical, said Musgrave, and a person would have to drink over 1,000 liters of pyriproxyfen-treated water every day to feel any negative effects.""Even enormous quantities of pyriproxyfen do not cause the defects seen during the recent Zika outbreak,"" he said, adding that the pesticide is poorly absorbed by humans and rapidly broken down, so even the minute amounts humans would be exposed to via water treatment would be reduced even further.Another inconvenient truth the report fails to mention is that there is mounting scientific evidence that implicates the Zika virus in microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born with smaller-than-usual heads and may experience developmental challenges. The World Health Organization says scientists are ""weeks"" away from confirming a causal link, and other researchers, including those with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, say the link is ""strongly suspected.""The Argentinean doctors argued that Brazil is the only country that experienced a spike of microcephalic births in the midst of a Zika virus epidemic, but that isn't true. Doctors in French Polynesia, a group of islands that experienced an 11 percent Zika virus infection rate in 2013, are examining the medical records of 17 cases of ""central nervous system malformations"" in fetuses and infants. Twelve of these fetuses had cerebral malformations, including brain lesions, and five babies had brainstem dysfunction and absence of swallowing. None of their mothers experienced Zika virus symptoms, but four did test positive for signs of flavivirus -- a group of viruses that includes Zika.What's more, there are already lab studies that confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the blood, tissue, brains and amniotic fluid of fetuses and babies diagnosed with microcephaly. The most recent, and probably most disturbing, example of these studies was published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. A woman who lived in Brazil during her first trimester of pregnancy confirmed, at 32 weeks, that the fetus she was carrying had severe microcephaly with calcifications in the brain and placenta.  In an autopsy of her fetus, doctors found that its brain was almost completely smooth, was collecting fluid, and showed calcification in many parts. They also found evidence of Zika virus in the brain tissue, but nowhere else in the fetus' body. Other analyses suggested that the virus was able to hide and replicate in the fetus' brain, and that the damage this caused might have slowed development of the brain at around 20 weeks gestation. The Argentinian group insists that the cause of microcephaly must be local to Brazil because Colombia has thousands of pregnant women with Zika virus and not one diagnosed case of microcephaly at birth or in the womb.But that theory ignores an important timeline: Because the virus first hit Colombia in October, women who could have gotten Zika virus in their first month of pregnancy would only be about five months along right now. It generally takes about six months of pregnancy for a doctor to be able to diagnose microcephaly via ultrasound, reports The New York Times.What's more, unlike Brazil, Colombia is allowing women with Zika virus to access abortion services. Indeed, one woman told the New York Times that she decided to end her pregnancy after her doctors detected a deformity in her ultrasound. Only time will tell how Colombia's babies will be affected by Zika virus, but making an evaluation now is hasty and doesn't align with scientists' understanding of microcephaly.Brazil's microcephaly cases are strongly concentrated in the northeast region of the country, especially in the state Pernambuco. But that's because, as the Argentinean doctors themselves note, this part of Brazil is impoverished, with ""poor urbanisation and inadequate sanitation."" The lack of running water or a reliable sewage system forces families to store large amounts of water for domestic use in containers near the house, and those are perfect breeding areas for mosquitoes. Those living conditions, in and of themselves, are why mosquitos proliferate in such areas, and why Pernambuco in particular has seen the highest rates of Zika virus infection and microcephaly, experts say.Other states that don't treat their water with the pesticide have also reported microcephaly cases, Brazil's Ministry of Health noted.  The report implicates the U.S.-based agribusiness giant Monsanto, a company regularly mentioned in online eco-conspiracy theories. But the truth is that Monsanto is not involved in any way in the sale or manufacture of pyriproxyfen, which is made by a Japanese manufacturer named Sumitomo Chemical. And though Sumitomo works with Monsanto on some crop-based projects, the companies are not linked on water treatment, Monsanto notes. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, Sumitomo similarly denounced the report linking its larvicide to microcephaly, pointing out that the World Health Organization has approved this chemical for mosquito control, and that it has been used in France, Denmark, Spain, Turkey, the Dominican Republic and Colombia.Emotions are running high when it comes to Zika virus and its suspected link to serious birth defects like microcephaly. While alternate theories for the cause of the birth defects shouldn't be dismissed outright, they do need to be put through rigorous scientific inquiry.    ","huffingtonpost","left","16847","zika",1426

"The Pan-American regional wing of the World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that the African Zika virus will likely spread to all nations where its carrier mosquito lives, which includes all but two nations on the hemisphere.""PAHO [the Pan-American Health Organization] anticipates that Zika virus will continue to spread and will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found,"" the group warned this week in a statement in which it reiterated warnings for pregnant women to avoid areas where the Aedes Aegypti mosquito lives. Aedes carries Dengue, Chikungunya, Yellow Fever, and Zika, among other diseases. It lives mostly in tropical atmospheres, and in the United States is most common in humid, hot climates in Texas and Puerto Rico.The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued travel warnings for a number of countries and territories on the continent, in addition to Puerto Rico. This week, the agency added Barbados, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Cape Verde, Samoa and the island of Saint Martin.The two nations exempt from this warning due to the absence of Aedes mosquitos in the area are Chile and Canada.The Zika virus has been described as giving a patient milder versions of the symptoms associated with Dengue fever. In pregnant women, however, Brazilian medical experts have documented links between Zika and microcephaly, an infant deformity in which children are born with skulls too small for their brains, causing significant mental damage.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Pernambuco, Brazil, told CNN in December. Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Jamaica made the same recommendation last week, following a surge in documented Zika cases.The WHO is echoing this warning specifically to pregnant women. ""Pregnant women should be especially careful to avoid mosquito bites Women planning to travel to areas where Zika is circulating should consult a healthcare provider before traveling and upon return,"" the group says in their statement.Brazil has registered 3,893 cases of microcephaly suspected to be related to Zika virus contamination, national newspaper O Globo reported this week. The United States, meanwhile, has registered 12 cases of Zika, all contracted in Latin America. At least two of those cases, both in Illinois, were pregnant women. The CDC has documented at least one case of an infant born with microcephaly believed to be related to Zika.Medical professionals have documented three Zika cases in New York. One of those patients is fully recovered. ""There is practically no risk of contracting the virus in New York state at this time,"" Department of Health head Howard Zucker told O Globo, though concerns about those traveling abroad persist, particularly as Brazil prepares to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.Brazilian officials have vowed to begin inspections for mosquitos four months before the Olympics and perform daily inspections during the event to ensure minimal threat of contracting the disease.

"The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and sometimes brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean, and with the high volume of news about the virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.Here are seven updates, opinions and developments to know about now:  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is launching the largest government-led study to date on the suspected link between Zika virus and microcephaly, reports Reuters. Together with scientists from Brazil's health ministry, they will enroll 100 mothers with babies that have microcephaly, as well as 300 to 400 pairs of mothers with healthy babies. The two groups will be tested to see if they have signs of past Zika virus infection, as well as queried about other kinds of environmental exposures during pregnancy that may have caused microcephaly.Scientists hope that this research will reveal the relative risk of microcephaly -- in other words, the probability of having a baby with microcephaly -- in women that had Zika virus as opposed to women who didn't have it, and preliminary results are expected by May. Colombian researchers, meanwhile, are conducting a study that looks forward in time. They're following 2,000 pregnant women with Zika virus to see whether they give birth to a healthy baby or a baby with microcephaly, the Associated Press reports. The World Health Organization says there's growing evidence to suggest a link between the virus and birth defects in babies; Brazilian doctors have found the virus in the brains of babies born with microcephaly, reports Reuters. However, WHO's executive director Dr. Bruce Aylward said it could be four to six months before scientists confirm the relationship. Aylward said he was confident that Brazil is going to have a ""fantastic,"" ""successful"" Olympics, and that the country will get the mosquito population under control by August, when the international games start. An estimated 1.5 million Brazilians may have contracted Zika virus, and more cases are expected. Because of this, Aylward said he expects many people will have an immunity by the time the Olympics starts.However, global travel data suggests that others don't share Aylward's sunny perspective. Airline ticket sales to Latin American and Caribbean destinations have fallen 3.4 percent compared to last year, reports Reuters. Before the CDC warning was issued Jan. 15, ticket sales to these destinations were actually up 4.9 percent.  Because Zika virus appears to be causing physical brain defects in infants, researchers believe the disease could also ultimately affect the mental health of children who appear to be born healthy, reports the New York Times. In other words, not all of the ways it affects the brain may be as immediately obvious as microcephaly. There is increasing evidence that exposure in utero to infections like rubella, herpes and flu may potentially contribute to higher rates of schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder, the Times notes. Scientists need to do more research to see what, if any, link there may be between Zika virus exposure in utero and mental health issues later on in a child's life.Puerto Rico will begin importing its entire blood supply from the continental United States at a cost of $100,000 per week because of Zika virus, Reuters reports. So far there have only been a handful of local transmissions of the virus in the territory, but health officials anticipate that that the number of cases there will shoot into the thousands during peak mosquito season this summer.The cost of importing blood is expected to create major hardship in Puerto Rico, which is currently $70 billion in debt and has a poverty rate of 45 percent. Local officials are also worried about the possibility that importing blood will derail the county's voluntary blood donation system after Zika is no longer a threat. The U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa are also experiencing local Zika transmissions, but both already import their blood supply from the continental U.S. and Hawaii. Both nations' top medical experts will share resources and information to confirm the suspected link between Zika virus and create a vaccine for the disease, reports Reuters. There are at least 15 companies or academic groups around the world trying to create a vaccine. In a press conference last Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that at least three pharmaceutical companies were in talks with his agency to develop Zika virus vaccines. The NIAID is currently working on two different kinds of Zika virus vaccines. Zika virus experts often say that only about one in five infected people will feel any symptoms at all when they contract the disease, making it difficult to know for certain how many people have it.It turns out that this figure is based on a single study published about an outbreak on the tiny island of Yap, home to a little over 7,000 residents, reports Reuters. Researchers, especially those in Brazil, are now questioning this statistic, saying that it needs to be revisited in light of the fact that their country is much bigger, more diverse and has experienced the largest outbreak to date. In addition to learning more about the suspected link to microcephaly, Brazilian researchers say having a more accurate number will help them calculate the people who didn't get the virus, and thus remain vulnerable to a future outbreak.Health officials estimate that as many as 1.5 million in Brazil may have been infected with Zika virus. On Friday, the CDC issued their first Zika guidelines for doctors who treat children and infants. These were made up of three separate parts:Children: Doctors should suspect and test for Zika virus in babies and children under 18 years old if they have two or more symptoms (fever, rash, red eyes or joint pain) and if they've traveled to or lived in an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission in the past two weeks. And because moms can pass Zika virus to their babies during delivery, doctors should also suspect and test for Zika virus in newborns two weeks old and less under those same conditions.Newborns: Doctors may also want to test newborn babies for Zika virus if they appear to have microcephaly or brain calcifications in the womb or at birth, or if their mothers test positive for the disease during the pregnancy, the CDC says. However, babies without these specific issues, or whose mothers tested negative for the disease or weren't tested at all, should continue receiving care as normal.Breastfeeding: Despite the fact that Zika virus RNA has been found in breast milk, there is no evidence that breastfeeding can pass the disease from mother to child. Because of this, the CDC guidelines also state that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the theoretical transmission risk. Like adults, babies and children who contract Zika virus will likely experience only mild symptoms, the CDC notes. If anyone turns up positive, avoiding future mosquito bites is of upmost importance in order to prevent it from spreading to others.","huffingtonpost","left","16853","zika",1358
"Texas Governor Greg Abbott has taken action and appointed an infectious disease task force to prepare for the Zika virus in the Lone Star state. On Thursday, the Texas Governor appointed 31 members to the Task Force on Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response. Dr. John Hellerstedt will serve as director.In a press release obtained by Breitbart Texas, Abbott said the Task Force was created ""to provide expert, evidence-based assessments, protocols, and recommendations related to state responses to infectious diseases, and to serve as a reliable and transparent source of information and education for Texas leadership and citizens.""As reported by Breitbart Texas on Thursday, the Zika virus has hit the Mexican border city of Reynosa. According to state health officials, the victim was identified as a man who had recently traveled to Colombia which is one of the countries that has seen an outbreak of the disease. The appearance of the Zika virus in Mexico has kept Mexican health officials on alert after the country has seen more than 34 cases in recent weeks.An expert in pediatric infectious diseases told reporters in Dallas that people in Texas who are infected with the Zika virus could infect mosquitoes and start a new ""transmission cycle"" in Texas, as reported by Breitbart Texas. Dr. Jeffrey Kahn is the chief of pediatric infectious diseases for the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. He also serves a director of infectious diseases at Children's Medical Center.In an interview with NBCDFW in Dallas on Tuesday, Dr. Kahn said, ""As we head towards springtime, if we have a lot of people infected with Zika, either because they are imported cases or sexually acquired cases, that may trigger the mosquitoes to get infected with the virus and start that transmission cycle. And, once that occurs, it's almost impossible to get the virus out of the population.""The following individuals have been appointed to serve on this task force:Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

"From the Zika virus to the contaminated water crisis in Flint to trying to rescue Puerto Rico from its debt crisis, Congress is once again faced with a series of thorny questions over just how much taxpayers will be asked to shell out.Democrats insist that more money is the answer and say Capitol Hill should approve emergency financing to avert the crises. But conservatives say plenty of money is already available and all sides need to spend it better to combat inevitable problems.Less than four months into the year, fiscal fights have stalled a bipartisan energy bill in the Senate, forced the White House to shift funds away from the Ebola fight and left Puerto Rico struggling to stay afloat in a sea of red ink.Trapped in the middle is House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, who is trying to wrangle his own caucus while holding the line on Democrats' requests for billions of dollars in supplemental funding.The fights over spending forced him to miss the April 15 deadline set in law for approving a new budget, as he tried to quell a conservative rebellion over the funding levels agreed to last year.""We're still having conversations with our members, and we do want to pass a budget resolution,"" Mr. Ryan insisted Thursday - though he acknowledged that the impetus for getting that accomplished has diminished.But Rep. Dave Brat, Virginia Republican, said Congress can't begin to entertain Democrats' supplemental spending requests for Zika or Flint until lawmakers settle on a top spending number.""Supplemental means 'on top of.' On top of what?"" Mr. Brat said.Democrats say the situation is already urgent - particularly in the case of Zika, which has been directly linked to birth defects.""The Republicans' appalling fecklessness in the face of a frightening public health emergency is beyond dangerous,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said Thursday. ""It could have devastating consequences for thousands of America's children and families.""Conservative activists say any new funding must be offset by cuts elsewhere.""The federal government is already spending too much money,"" said Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action, a conservative group. ""If pressing needs arise, lawmakers should reprioritize current spending to meet those needs. So far, so good.""Mr. Ryan has pushed off those fights, saying lawmakers can't deal with them later this year as the spending committees write the dozen bills to fund basic government operations for 2017.It is not unusual for Congress to face sudden or unanticipated costs. Mr. Ryan's predecessor, John A. Boehner, faced withering criticism in January 2013 from Democrats and Northeast Republicans for not fast-tracking $60 billion in relief for Superstorm Sandy.Congress has tried to budget for disasters since then but still struggles, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.""Just because we don't know when they will happen or what they will look like doesn't mean we don't know they will happen,"" he said. ""We should do more to prepare on the front end, and if not at least be willing to pay for them over time.""This year's fight centers on multiple crises, forcing Republican leaders to justify their response to each one.Mr. Obama has asked Congress for $1.9 billion to combat the Zika virus, and Democrats tried to attach the money to a veterans spending bill last week. Republicans shot it down.Mr. Obama's request ""covers practically anything that a bureaucrat wants it to cover. We need detailed information,"" said Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration has provided those details and that Republicans will clamor for forgiveness when Zika dominates the headlines this summer.""I don't know what Republicans are going to say that they did to prepare for it,"" he said.A fight over $300 million in aid to Flint, Michigan, helped derail an energy bill this year. Democrats insisted on sending federal money to Flint to help clean up after lead leached into the city's water supply, endangering children's health.Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, Michigan Democrats, lifted their hold on the energy bill Thursday, allowing it to proceed without the Flint package.Democrats also tried to add $600 million in drug-fighting money to a bill aimed at stopping the opioids epidemic. They won support of a handful of Senate Republicans but were derailed by the others, who said enough money already is available.Mr. Ryan's task of managing got harder last week when his party's right flank balked at a Republican-authored bill to keep Puerto Rico from drowning in its bond debt.Opponents of the bill said it rewrote lending rules, even though ""progressive socialist"" policies led to the island's predicament, meaning taxpayers would likely be forced to bail out Puerto Rico down the road.Mr. Ryan rejected that view Thursday, saying the bill imposes an oversight board to avoid an expensive rescue mission later on.""There will be no taxpayer bailout,"" he said at his weekly press conference. ","washingtontimes","right","16908","zika",842
"The chief of the Centers for Disease Control said Thursday the U.S. needs new funding to ""provide the protection that Americans deserve"" against the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne virus that's been linked to serious birth defects in Latin America and has infected hundreds in Puerto Rico.Speaking one day before a major Zika summit in Atlanta, Dr. Tom Frieden doubled down on the administration's plea to Congress for emergency funding to fight the virus at home and abroad.President Obama is locked in a stalemate with congressional Republicans over his $1.9 billion request, with GOP leaders saying the administration should spend leftover Ebola funds before it asks for new money.Dr. Frieden and other cabinet officials have said they do not want to short-change efforts to fully stamp out Ebola, a virus that killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa from December 2013 to late 2015.""I think it would be dangerous to let down our guard and take funds away from one activity that is protecting Americans and stopping disease there, so it doesn't come here, to fight the latest threat,"" Dr. Frieden said on National Public Radio's ""Here and Now.""Neither side of the funding standoff appears ready to budge, so Dr. Frieden said the CDC is looking for funding anywhere it can find some, including the private sector.""The bottom line here is that we need resources to provide the protection that Americans deserve,"" he said.Though Zika isn't transmitting locally in the continental U.S., the CDC has recorded 312 travel-related cases in the 50 states and D.C., including 27 cases in pregnant women.U.S. territories have reported 349 cases of locally acquired infection, mostly in Puerto Rico, but the mainland could see local transmission once temperatures rise in the summer.In fact, Zika-carrying mosquitoes inhabit a greater portion of the U.S. than previously thought, according to maps posted by the CDC on Wednesday.The virus' primary vector, the Aedes aegypti, has been found as far north as San Francisco, Kansas City, Missouri, Cincinnati and New York City.Previous maps suggested the mosquito was mainly clustered in the South.Another carrier, the Aedes albopictus, has an even larger footprint in the U.S., stretching into southern Minnesota and New England, though it is less likely to spread Zika and related viruses than the Aedes aegypti.The CDC said its updated maps do not indicate the prevalence of the mosquitoes or likelihood of infection in any given area.Zika is a little-known virus that festered for decades in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region before globe-hopping to Latin America, where it has spread to more than 20 countries.Its rapid transmission has been tied to a sharp uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, or microcephaly, and Guillian-Barre syndrome, which can lead to paralysis.Federal, state and local officials will gather at CDC headquarters on Friday to discuss the latest scientific data on Zika and coordinate an effective response to the threat.The Aedes aegypti tends to live inside homes, so the ability to spray for them is limited.Puerto Ricans told CDC focus groups that they would allow officials to spray EPA-approved insecticides in their homes, Dr. Frieden said, even if there is a widespread belief that pregnant women would resist the intrusion.""We found just the opposite. That women would welcome it,"" he told NPR. ""They are extremely concerned about the risk of Zika, they understand that it may be a devastating problem."" ","washingtontimes","right","16891","zika",584
"Jason KanderSen. Roy Blunt (R-MI) is chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies. The significance of that is that that's the subcommittee that's supposed to be considering President Obama's request for $1.9B in funding to combat Zika. It's not, which Blunt's challenger, Democrat Jason Kander, says is a big problem, particularly for Missouri.""Despite overwhelming scientific evidence months ago that made it clear the Zika virus was going to be a danger to the U.S., and the very clear threat that it poses to pregnant women, Senator Blunt hasn't moved fast enough to provide the funding necessary to take this seriously,"" Jason said. ""This isn't a partisan issue, this is science and every moment Congress fails to act is one where we leave the American people vulnerable. There are already nearly 500 reported cases of the Zika virus and it is a threat to Missouri, so Congress has a responsibility to do its job immediately.""In fact, there are at least two pregnant women in Missouri who have been diagnosed with Zika. But Blunt is taking a pretty lackadaisical attitude toward it all, saying that there wasn't a need for immediate funding since the administration had $600 million diverted from Ebola. It's worth remembering here how Blunt reacted to Ebola two years ago. He was panicked enough over it in 2014 to call blocking people coming to the U.S. from countries with Ebola. But Zika is a whole different thing, he says, and ""not particularly scary"" to most people. So even though it kills babies, and at least two of his constituents who have it are pregnant, it's not worth getting worked up about.You can bet if those women have deformed babies before the election, Blunt is going to try to blame it all on President Obama for not responding adequately to the threat.Please donate $3 today to help Jason Kander get this guy out of the Senate.","dailykos","left","16933","zika",330
"Powerful House Republicans told the Obama administration Thursday to use leftover funds from the Ebola fight to address the spread of Zika virus, saying it is the fastest way to respond to the latest global health scare and that Congress can replace the money later on, if needed.House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers said the administration hasn't spent about $2.7 billion of the $5.3 billion set aside to deal with the Ebola outbreak that ravaged West Africa from December 2013 to late 2015.The chairman told President Obama to draw from that well instead of expecting Congress to rubber-stamp his request for $1.8 billion in new money to combat Zika - a mosquito-borne disease that has been linked to serious birth defects in Latin America.""If additional funds are then needed to backfill the use of these funds in the future, we stand ready to consider such a request as part of the FY 2017 appropriations process. But if an urgent response is what is required, then it seems clear that substantial funds are already available without any further delay,"" Mr. Rogers, Kentucky Republican, and two of his chief appropriators wrote to Shaun Donovan, director of the Office of Management and Budget.The appropriators said figures from the HHS, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department suggest there is ample cash left over to fight Zika without slowing down West Africa's recovery.Their letter sets up a clash between congressional GOP leaders and the administration, which had insisted on keeping the Ebola funds in place to finish the job in West Africa.Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told Congress last week that workers in Sierra Leone recently uncovered a new case of Ebola, even though transmission had been declared over, underscoring the need for continued efforts.Late Thursday, OMB issued a statement that said Mr. Obama will ask Congress for authority to use ""a portion"" of remaining Ebola funds ""that have not yet been obligated or planned for critical activities"" to fight Zika or other infectious diseases, although it did not put a dollar amount on that portion and reiterated its commitment to the Ebola fight.""In order to maintain a readiness posture in the event of new cases of Ebola, the administration has chosen to submit to Congress in the coming days an emergency supplemental appropriations request to respond to the Zika virus both domestically and internationally,"" the office said.Congressional Democrats were more forceful, saying Republicans wanted to ""rob Peter to pay Paul.""""Supplemental funding for Ebola was not enacted as a piggy bank to raid in the event of another health crisis,"" Rep. Nita M. Lowey, New York Democrat and ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, said alongside Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, Connecticut Democrat.While U.S. leaders tussle over their priorities, the World Bank Group on Thursday said it will extend $150 million in financing to Latin American and Caribbean nations that have been affected by Zika transmission.High rates of transmission, particularly in Brazil, have been linked to a significant uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly.Zika will cost the region about $3.5 billion - or 0.06 percent of gross domestic product - in lost income in 2016, mostly because pregnant women and their families will avoid travel to the region, according to initial projections by the World Bank.The damage could grow to more than 1 percent of GDP, however, in Caribbean nations that are heavily dependent on tourism.""Our analysis underscores the importance of urgent action to halt the spread of the Zika virus and to protect the health and well-being of people in the affected countries,"" bank President Jim Yong Kim said. ""The World Bank Group stands ready to support the countries affected by this health crisis and to provide additional support if needed.""The bank acknowledged that its projection assumed there would be a ""swift, well-coordinated international response"" to the virus, and that Zika's most significant health risks - and behaviors to avoid infection - apply to pregnant women.The bank said it will revise its projections if scientists confirm a link between Zika and Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can lead to paralysis, or discover other troubling things about the virus ","washingtontimes","right","16849","zika",709
"The White House will shift more than $500 million away from the Ebola fight in West Africa to combat the Zika virus that's been linked to serious birth defects, tacitly caving to GOP demands Wednesday, though officials still want nearly $2 billion from Congress to combat the mosquito-borne illness.Cabinet officials said their transfer of $510 million from Ebola and $79 million from other accounts will prop up research into a better diagnostic test and vaccine for Zika and bolster efforts to eradicate the pesky mosquito that ferries the virus.Top Republicans had pressed for the shift in funds for months, rejecting the administration's pleas for new money and saying the Ebola account could be tapped.But the White House insisted the quick infusion isn't enough, and says Mr. Obama will still insist on an additional $1.9 billion to replenish the Ebola money and expand Zika efforts even more.""Without the full amount of requested emergency supplemental funding, many activities that need to start right now would have to be delayed or curtailed or stopped within months,"" said Shaun Donovan, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.Zika has been linked to a surge in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly, in Brazil and other Latin American countries. It's also been tied to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis.

Additional Zika money could inflame that fight.House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers says the administration hasn't spent about $2.7 billion of the $5.3 billion set aside to deal with the Ebola outbreak, and that Congress could backfill the use of those funds during the fiscal 2017 appropriations process.On Wednesday he praised the White House's move.""These resources - which the agencies already have on hand - will help stop the growth of this devastating disease around the world, and prepare for and protect against outbreaks within our borders,"" the Kentucky Republican said.The administration had long said it might repurpose some of its Ebola funding on top of its supplemental request, though on Wednesday it said that amount should not be debited from the pending request.""I want to be very clear that our $1.9 billion request remains our $1.9 billion request,"" Mr. Donovan said, arguing Congress should not force them to choose between fighting Zika and fighting Ebola.The administration has said it wants to totally stamp out Ebola, which has killed more than 11,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea since December 2013.Officials pointed to a cluster of flare-ups in Guinea and the Ebola-related death of a 30-year-old woman in Liberia last week, just days after the World Health Organization said the outbreak was no longer a public health emergency of international concern.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the WHO's declaration means Ebola is winding down, so it is time to redirect those funds to Zika.""By doing this, we can protect against outbreaks without burdening the taxpayers further,"" the California Republican said.Though Zika isn't spreading by mosquitoes in the continental U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 312 travel-related cases in the 50 states and D.C., including 27 cases in pregnant women.U.S. territories have reported 349 cases of locally acquired infection, mostly in Puerto Rico.Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said a baby born with microcephaly in Hawaii tested positive for Zika, and states like Texas and Florida will be on the front lines of local transmission this summer. As temperatures climb, the climate becomes more hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Republicans in affected states will regret not falling in line behind Mr. Obama's request.""I guess at some point,"" he said, ""they're going to have to choose whether or not their animosity toward President Obama trumps their desire to try to protect pregnant women in their states from this terrible disease."" ","washingtontimes","right","16897","zika",726

"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Mosquitoes that can transmit the Zika virus have been found to live in nearly all U.S. states, according to maps released this week by authorities trying to assess the public health threat.The maps show the two breeds of virus-carrying mosquitoes, the yellow fever and the Asian tiger mosquito, can live in the nation's northernmost states of Michigan, New Hampshire, Washington state and Minnesota, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Zika, which has been linked to numerous cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, has spread rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean. Microcephaly is marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.In the United States, Zika has only been found in the territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands.The mosquitoes, whose scientific names are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, were concentrated most heavily in the U.S. Southeast and Southwest, according to the CDC maps that break each state down to its individual counties.The maps (tmsnrt.rs/1U5njHx and tmsnrt.rs/1U5nP8t) utilized data back to 1995, including information from the CDC, university researchers and local health departments.The Asian tiger mosquito, which lives in semi-rural settings, was captured at least once in 40 states, while the yellow fever mosquito, which prefers urban areas, was found in 26 states, the CDC said.Overall, they were found in roughly a third of the 3,141 counties in the United States, it said.""Accurate and up-to-date information for the geographical ranges of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in the United States is urgently needed,"" authors of a paper containing the maps wrote this week in the Journal of Medical Entomology.On Thursday, the World Health Organization advised women living in areas where Zika is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant, advice already given by several countries where the virus is in widespread transmission.The connection between Zika and microcephaly came to light last fall in Brazil, which has confirmed more than 1,400 cases of microcephaly it considers to be related to Zika infections in mothers.(Reporting by Sebastien Malo, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.

"UPDATE: The CDC's guidelines for pregnant travelers returning from an area with Zika virus transmission changed Feb. 5. See the latest advice for pregnant women who may have been exposed to the virus but aren't experiencing symptoms.News about Zika virus -- the tropical, mosquito-borne disease that may be responsible for birth defects and an autoimmune syndrome -- is probably all over your Facebook feed, radio broadcast or TV screen. Or maybe you're all set to go to that long-awaited wedding or bachelorette party in Mexico, and your mom keeps sending you newspaper clippings in an effort to get you to cancel your trip. As paranoia builds, you may wonder: should I be worried about Zika virus, and should I get tested for Zika virus when I get back from my trip?Some background: Zika virus cases didn't appear in Latin America, where it's currently spreading, until May 2015. Then, in Oct. 2015, the Brazilian government alerted the World Health Organization to an alarming increase in infants born with microcephaly, a condition in which a fetus' brain doesn't develop properly in the womb and the baby is then born with an abnormally small head. Between Oct. 2015 to Jan. 2016, over 4,000 babies in Brazil have been born with this condition, which can cause lifelong intellectual disability, developmental delays and even death. This is a sharp increase from the years 2010 to 2014, when Brazil averaged only about 156 cases of microcephaly each year. The country also saw an uptick in cases of Guillian-Barre syndrome, a condition that causes temporary paralysis and, in rare cases, death. Besides these possible but as-yet-unconfirmed disease links, one of the most disturbing aspects of Zika virus is that not everyone who gets it even knows they have it, and we don't know what this means in terms of its effect on fetuses in utero. The virus' symptoms are mild. They include a rash, fever, joint pain and red eyes that last between two and seven days, and are in fact so mild that some people may not experience any symptoms at all.The World Health Organization estimates that one in four infected people may not experience symptoms, while other experts think the proportion is reversed: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites studies that say that up to 80 percent of people who get Zika virus don't get any symptoms and thus don't know they have it.What if you're a recent traveler from one of the 24 Zika-affected countries or territories about which the CDC issued health warnings? What happens if you know you got mosquito bites, but aren't experiencing any symptoms?If you are healthy and not pregnant, you probably have nothing to worry about, most experts say. Dr. Michael Klompas of the Division of Infectious Disease at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston says that because there's no specific cure for Zika virus, there's no benefit to figuring out if an asymptomatic person has it. In other words, there's no symptom to treat, and we have nothing to treat it with anyway.If you're a recent traveler who does have any one of the four symptoms, you should seek a doctor's help regardless of whether or not you think it's Zika virus, as the disease shares symptoms with other tropical or mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and Chikungunya virus and more run-of-the-mill but serious things like measles, rubella and enterovirus. The doctor should then determine whether or not to request a Zika virus test for you based on your travel dates, activities and symptoms, according to CDC guidelines.The stakes are higher for pregnant travelers, who, if infected with Zika virus, may run the risk of giving birth to a child with microcephaly.But the CDC generally steers asymptomatic pregnant travelers straight to ultrasounds rather than testing, suggesting that they schedule regular visits to monitor fetal growth. If microcephaly or other head abnormalities are detected, then the traveler should get tested for Zika.Symptomatic pregnant travelers should get tested for the virus only if they experience two or more of the disease's common symptoms during or within two weeks of travel to an area with local transmission, or if recent ultrasounds indicate that their fetus may have microcephaly or other cranial abnormalities, according to CDC guidelines.This may sound lax considering the possible link between Zika and birth defects. Shouldn't every pregnant woman who may have been exposed be tested, you may wonder (and some experts have)? As the New York Times points out, microcephaly is only detectable by ultrasound after the second trimester, which means asymptomatic mothers may have to wait a very long time before seeing if their child is at risk for the condition.Health authorities may be hesitant to recommend testing for asymptomatic pregnant moms because the U.S. doesn't have the laboratory capacity to test every pregnant woman who travels to Latin America and the Caribbean during the nine months of her pregnancy. Also, there's no evidence to know either way whether noticeable Zika symptoms play a role in birth defects, or whether mere presence of the virus poses a danger. Despite these ambiguities, Stephen Morse, an epidemiology professor at the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University, supports the CDC's approach to testing for pregnant women. He says that while he's sympathetic toward those who are coming back from a Zika-affected country with mosquito bites, probably the best thing they can do is to get standard prenatal care, which includes sonograms, early on.  ""The usual antenatal testing should pick up any abnormalities, including [microcephaly],"" said Morse. ""That's probably going to be much more informative than testing for the virus."" There's also the question of availability. There are no commercially available Zika virus tests, and only a handful of places in the U.S., including the CDC, are performing them. This means that most doctors who order a test will have to send it off to a specialized laboratory with assistance from their local or state health department. Dr. Anna Durbin, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that if pregnant travelers sought Zika virus tests just because they got mosquito bites, the requests would ""overwhelm all systems.""It's a troubling set of circumstances for pregnant Americans who were either in a Zika-affected country when travel warnings were issued or who absolutely cannot abide by the agency's advice to postpone travel. But for now, the official advice for pregnant travelers, barring any personal symptoms, is to watch and wait on what ultrasounds are turning up on their fetuses. So far, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador and Jamaica have advised women in their countries to postpone pregnancy until the Zika epidemic is over. The U.S. has also advised all pregnant women to postpone travel to a Zika-affected country, and for women who want to become pregnant to seek advice from their healthcare provider first.  This story has been updated with the latest count of babies born with microcephaly in Brazil.  ","huffingtonpost","left","16827","zika",1195
"The National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) might pull out of the Summer Olympics due to the Zika outbreak in Brazil.""Obviously, we are not going to risk taking Kenyans there if this Zika virus reaches epidemic levels,"" insisted Kipchoge Keino, head of NOCK. ""They have to assure us that the country is safe enough to take athletes there.""NOCK quickly backed away from Keino's statement. ""It is too early to make a determination on the status of the virus during the games time which is six months away,"" stated Stephen Soi, NOCK's chief of mission for Rio.The African country boasts some of the best runners in the world, expected to win many medals at the games. Even if they decide to go, factors such as ""allegations of widespread doping following a spate of failed drug tests"" could keep the runners from performing in track and field.Kenyan runners captured eleven medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.Despite the name, the Summer Olympics will take place during winter in Brazil. Officials hope the cooler weather in the Southern Hemisphere will kill the Aedes aegypti mosquito known to spread Zika and diminish the threat. Spring formally begins in September.The U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) recommended that any athlete or trainer concerned about the Zika outbreak should consider not attending the Olympics.""One of the things that they immediately said was, especially for women that may be pregnant or even thinking of getting pregnant, that whether you are scheduled to go to Rio or no, that you shouldn't go,"" explained Donald Anthony, president and chairman of USA fencing. ""And no one should go if they feel at all as though that that threat could impact them.""The Australian Olympic Committee encouraged its female athletes to educate themselves about Zika and ""consider the risks of competing in the Rio Olympics due to the outbreak of Zika.""""Any team members who are pregnant at the time of the Games need to consider the risks very carefully before deciding whether to proceed with travel to Brazil,"" they said.Athletes will receive mosquito repellent from officials, who also recommend everyone wear long sleeves when possible.Brazil's government promised to fumigate and sterilize Olympic stadiums leading up to the games. The health workers plan to follow the same procedures every day during the Olympics.The World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a public health emergency on February 1, due to the thousands of cases of the virus linked to birth defects in newborn children. Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which occurs when the brain does not form properly and results in a small head. This leads to serious mental disabilities.Following the outbreak of Zika, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases compared to the 147 in 2014.","breitbart","right","16840","zika",488
"A handful of Zika virus cases have turned up in the United States, but so far, all but one of those infected are people who have recently traveled to affected countries.On Thursday, KMTV reported two cases of Zika had been identified in Nebraska. Both cases involved women in their 20s who had recently traveled to countries where the virus is spreading.On Wednesday, the governor of Florida declared a state of emergency in four counties where the virus has been identified. So far, nine cases of Zika have been identified in the state, all of them connected to recent travel abroad.Earlier this week, Texas health authorities confirmed the first case of Zika in someone who had not traveled abroad to an affected country. The virus is believed to have spread through sexual contact with a person who had recently traveled abroad and become infected. This was only the second reported case of sexual transmission of the disease, and some experts are expressing caution that the scientific link for such transmission is not yet proven. The total number of Zika cases in Texas currently stands at ten.Zika is a virus transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. The disease causes relatively mild symptoms, including joint pain and red eyes, in about 20% of individuals who are infected. However, the disease has been linked to a serious birth defect called microcephaly, which causes children to be born with smaller than normal heads and damaged brains.The disease is currently spreading throughout Brazil since an outbreak began in May of 2015. More than 4,000 cases of microcephaly in Brazil are suspected to have been caused by the virus, which is also spreading in Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean.The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the spread of the virus an international public health emergency because of the suspected link to microcephaly; however, WHO did not advise pregnant women to avoid affected areas. Some have seen this as politically motivated since Brazil is hosting the Olympics this summer.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended that pregnant women consider postponing travel to areas where the virus is spreading. Women who must travel to these areas are advised to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.There is currently no vaccine available to prevent Zika infection.","breitbart","right","16840","zika",382
"DALLAS, Texas - Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) Director Zachary Thompson expects local lab testing of the Zika virus to begin as quickly as next week in an effort to stay ahead of any potential outbreaks in North Texas.Thompson confirmed on Monday that DCHHS is finalizing plans to test people for the disease locally. ""Dallas County Health and Human Services is getting our lab up and running to do Zika testing next week. And that is going to help get faster turnaround on tests for those pregnant women who have traveled from those endemic countries,"" he told CBS DFW.Breitbart Texas reported Thompson recently stated DCHHS proactively pursued lab testing for the virus locally instead of having to send suspect blood samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, which can take up to a few weeks to receive results.The primary test group is pregnant women who traveled to one of the now 33 Zika-infested Latin American and Caribbean countries. They are at risk because of the suspected link between the virus and the neurological birth defect, microcephaly, where the unborn baby's brain does not fully develop. However, DCHHS spokeswoman Erika Neroes clarified for Breitbart Texas on Monday that screening is not exclusive to only pregnant women and will also include ""anyone who a doctor refers for Zika virus testing.""Despite concerns, Thompson told the Dallas ABC-TV affiliate WFAA 8: ""So you don't need to worry about it. There's no mosquitoes in North Texas area that's carrying the Zika virus so you should not be concerned. It's for those travelers who are returning back from those countries where the virus is at an outbreak.""Still, the DCHHS issued the CDC's interim guidelines advising men who return from travel in Zika affected areas to abstain from sex with their pregnant partners or wear condoms for the duration of the pregnancy.Neroes said that Dallas County testing will apply to residents in the outlying Collin, Ellis, Fannin, Grayson, Henderson, Hunt, Kaufman, Navarro, Rains, Rockwall, and Van Zant counties. She advised individuals residing in other Texas counties to contact the CDC for information on labs that serve their areas.Last week, Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) launched a Zika virus task force as did Governor Greg Abbott. The governor appointed  a 31 member infectious disease disease preparedness and response task force to address the Zika virus, which Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported.Dallas may not be the only municipality about to begin local testing for Zika virus. Carrie Williams with the Texas Department of State Health Services told Breitbart Texas by email that ""Texas is pursing the ability to test statewide at our lab in Austin, and we should have that up and running soon."" Williams also commented about the Dallas task force, ""I think we are all in agreement that we need to work to do everything we can to prevent a Zika virus outbreak here. We're supportive of local efforts to stay on top of this disease.""Mosquito season in North Texas starts in May. There are 10 cases of Zika virus in the state presently. All but one was travel-related, contracted while in a Zika infested country. The outstanding Dallas County case turned out to the first US case of sexually transmitted Zika virus acquired through a man who contracted Zika while in Venezuela.As local health officials gear up to test for Zika locally, they also await the results of four more suspected travel-related cases of the virus to return from the CDC.Dallas has faced other challenging health threats in recent years. Breitbart Texas reported comprehensively on the 2014 Ebola scare, prompted by a Liberian man infected with the deadly West African virus. He brought the first case of Ebola into the U.S. through Dallas, which spread to two nurses treating him. He later died. Although contained, fears of the Ebola virus spreading into the general population created a lot of frayed nerves across the Metroplex for months. In 2012, Dallas County tackled a West Nile virus epidemic in which County Judge Clay Jenkins declared a state of emergency.Also Monday, President Obama said he would ask Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to fight the virus. The U.S. Olympic Committee recommended athletes concerned about the Zika virus outbreak in Latin American countries should not attend the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, although Breitbart News reported it will be winter in the southern hemisphere at the time. Officials hope the cooler weather will kill the Aedes aegypti mosquito known to carry Zika, diminishing its threat.For now, the DCHHS continues to recommend reducing exposure to mosquito bites using the same techniques as during West Nile virus season, including using EPA approved repellants containing DEET. on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16840","zika",801
"Dr. Stella Guerra provides physical therapy on infant born with microcephaly due to Zika in Recife, Brazil.Source: www.cdc.gov/...At the start of 2016, when the effects of the Zika virus were first being understood and the potential threat began to be measured, President Obama took deliberate action leading to a request for $1.9 billion dollars in emergency funding.The White House and Democrats who participated in the talks say the sum, first requested in February, reflected what senior federal health officials determined is needed to track the spread of the disease, develop vaccines and study links between Zika and birth defects, among other tasks.The president collected the actual cost needed to address the issue, and submitted it to Congress. Republicans in the Senate proceeded to do nothing for the next four months, before putting together a package with just over half the amount of funds requested by the White House.But the Senate reaction was speedy compared to the House. After the Senate passed its bill, they first tried renaming a bill to deregulate pesticides and pretending that it was actually a Zika funding bill. Then they wasted another month insisting that these two intrinsically incompatible bills go to conference, even though they held nothing in common, which was a pointless and fruitless effort. Finally, as Ryan was trying to find an excuse to get the House out of town in the middle of the Democratic sit-in, they passed a bill similar to the Senate effort,-only this was was loaded with poison pills which worked to wreck the bill.But after five months of blocking funding-and as children continue to be born, or lost, with birth defects-Republicans are still confused by the fact that the White House actually wants the amount that's really needed.","dailykos","left","16988","zika",298
"In the wake of Zika virus outbreaks in South and Central America, a Dutch nonprofit is providing free, safe medical abortions for women in affected regions.Women on Web, a group dedicated to helping women obtain safe abortions, announced in a press release on Tuesday that women less than 9 weeks pregnant in Zika zones can contact them and receive an online consultation. Pending doctor approval, the group will send medical abortion pills -- the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol -- via mail.Zika, a mosquito-borne virus typically produces very mild symptoms in those infected, but it's been linked to clusters of serious birth defects in French Polynesia and Brazil. Though scientists haven't established a causal connection between Zika and the increase in microcephaly -- a condition causing a baby's head and brain to not fully develop -- the World Health Organization has designated the virus a public health emergency in light of the link.Health experts have warned women in ""Zika zones"" to delay pregnancy, but abortion is either severely restricted or outlawed altogether in many of affected countries.That's where Women on Web comes in.""The Zika virus is now spreading to most of the countries where abortion is very restricted,"" Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, the group's founder and director, told the AFP. ""We are extremely worried that this might cause increasing unsafe abortions. We really care about women's health and lives, and we want to make sure that women have access to a good medical abortion.""The nonprofit asks for a ""suggested donation"" between 79-90 euros, but no one is turned down if they can't pay.""We consider an unwanted pregnancy a medical emergency, and it is not ethical to deny care if somebody cannot afford it,"" Gomperts told Vice.But the service isn't available in Brazil, where nearly 4,000 cases of microcephaly were reported in the past year, and where the government intercepts any packages that contain medical abortion pills. Activists throughout Latin America have been pushing for more access to legal abortions in response to Zika.""What we have at this moment, in this country, is a group of women who is in fear of getting pregnant and not knowing what will happen during the pregnancy,"" Debora Diniz, professor at University of Brasilia, said in a recent video.","huffingtonpost","left","16835","zika",399

"David Sanders, University of the Western CapeThis article is a foundation essay. These are longer than usual and take a wider look at a key issue affecting society.The global health threats posed by recent viral epidemics, such as avian flu, H1N1, Ebola and Zika, have been happening too frequently to be dismissed as coincidental.Unless the global public health community invests in and develops better health systems that provide for the poor, such viruses will continue to spread and have severe effects.The mosquito-borne Zika virus was declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation in February 2016 due to an increase in the number of microcephaly cases in areas where the virus was found. Microcephaly is a birth defect where babies are born with abnormally small heads. A causal link between in-utero exposure to the Zika virus and microcephaly has not yet been proven.This is the first time since the Ebola epidemic hit Africa in 2014 that the World Health Organisation has declared a global health emergency. Although the speed with which the organisation reacted has been welcomed, mounting an emergency response is not sufficient to manage the spread of viral epidemics like that of Zika.In the case of the Ebola outbreak, after a long delay, the World Health Organisation called for an urgent change in three main areas. These included:rebuilding and strengthening national and international emergency preparedness and response;addressing the way new medical products are brought to market; andstrengthening the way in which the World Health Organisation operates during emergencies.But the response has not been far-reaching enough to prevent similar viral outbreaks. The Zika virus is proof of this.  Environmental, social and economic factors cause populations not previously affected by a particular disease to be exposed to its virus. To tackle such outbreaks in future, these factors must be addressed.Outbreaks happen for two reasons: the daily conditions that negatively affect the health of a country's inhabitants have not been addressed; and there are weak national health systems in place. There are several structural drivers that influence these, resulting in outbreaks and determining their severity. These include:the way populations move and migrate. This is compounded by generally poor access to (weak) health-care services, especially for migrant populations.hybrid viruses that appear in food processing factories and increase the chances of human-animal interactions.increased interaction between human and forest animals. This happens as indigent populations are forced deeper into forested areas to look for food.                                      A transmission electron micrograph of the Ebola virus.              Frederick A Murphy/ CDC  Global/ flickr                      This increased interaction is thought to be behind the spread of Ebola. Human beings were never the primary target of the virus. It is believed the virus was primarily found in a few species of fruit bats, which live in the tropical rainforests of central Africa.Although central Africa has been the site of all earlier major Ebola outbreaks, it is hundreds of kilometres from the epicentre of the latest epidemic, which took place in West Africa. The geographic spread may be explained by poverty forcing people deeper into the forests in search of food, where they came into contact with the fruit bats or other animals infected by the bats.How is the recent explosive Ebola outbreak explained? The answer lies not in the pathology of the disease but in the pathology of society, and the global political and economic architecture.The spread of the Ebola epidemic was the result of poverty and the ruthless exploitation of the region's natural resources. Those afflicted, at least initially, were typically the poorest - those forced, by scarcity, to look for food in the forests, where they came into contact with animals harbouring the virus.Economic exploitation also resulted in under-resourced and weak health systems that could not contain the spread of the virus.Take Sierra Leone, for instance. Its iron ore mining industry has rapidly expanded, fuelling economic growth in the country of 20% in 2013, according to the International Monetary Fund. Interest in its largely untapped mineral resources sparked a flood of investment a decade after the end of the devastating 1991 to 2002 civil war. The country's economic growth rate is ranked among the highest in the world.Yet in 2010 the country's mining industry contributed almost 60% of exports but only 8% of government revenue. In 2011, only one of the major mining firms in the country was paying corporate income tax, while none of the top five was reporting profits despite a boom in mineral exports.Similarly, both Liberia and Guinea have been heavily targeted by foreign companies. Liberia currently has the highest ratio of foreign direct investment to gross domestic product in the world. This largely is the result of foreign ownership of rubber production companies.In Guinea, the area affected by Ebola attracted agribusiness shortly before the outbreak. In 2010, the British-backed Farm Land of Guinea Limited bought huge tracts of land for maize and soybean cultivation. And an Italian energy company has bought more than 700,000 hectares for biofuel crops.These countries' dependence on extractive industries such as mining and logging, and financial losses due to tax evasion have left them impoverished and contributed to under-investment in - and the severe weakness of - their health systems.                                      Volunteer burial teams in Guinea disinfect themselves after carrying the body of an Ebola victim.              UN Photo/Martine Perret                      It is no accident that the Ebola epidemic affected three of the poorest countries in the world.Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone number 175, 179 and 183, respectively, out of 187 countries on the United Nations' Human Development Index. Their health systems are ineffective and almost nonexistent in many regions, affecting management of diseases.In Sierra Leone, for example, in the four months following the outbreak of Ebola, 848 people were infected by the virus and 365 died. And in an average four months, the country sees about 650 deaths from meningitis, 670 from tuberculosis, 790 from HIV/AIDS, 845 from diarrhoea and more than 3,000 from malaria.Such deaths have been occurring for decades, but with no previous focus on these countries.Furthermore, in these three countries there is a persistent crisis of human resources, with a serious deficit of health workers, especially in rural areas. This is a result of long-term underproduction and continuing migration. More Liberian and Sierra Leonean medical doctors work in the US and UK than in their home countries.As a start, it is important to focus on crisis response. The World Health Organisation had a feeble initial response to Ebola, in part, because of cuts of more than 50% in its outbreak and response budget - the very budget line needed to respond to Ebola. This dropped from US$469 million in 2012/2013 to US$228 million in 2014/2015, mainly because member states, particularly rich ones, failed to pay their financial contributions.But managing viral epidemics requires that authorities look beyond the immediate crisis response. A major and sustained investment in human resources is required. Initially, this will require greatly increased donor assistance.In the medium term, there is an urgent need to strengthen health systems in the region. Although talk of ""health systems strengthening"" has become commonplace there is little evidence of this in several African countries.But the most sustainable solution requires fundamental changes to economic and power relations between these countries and the capitalist economies and enterprises that continue to bleed them dry, often with the collusion of local officials and elites.Amit Sengupta, associate co-ordinator of the People's Health Movement, was involved in the formulation of this article.David Sanders, Emeritus Professor, School of Public Health, University of the Western CapeThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

"A large number of Americans have heard little or nothing about the Zika virus, according to a new poll Thursday that shows found most people in the U.S. are not terribly concerned about an outbreak here.The lack of awareness contrasts with Washington, where the Obama administration is preparing for the worst, and has requested billions of dollars to try to push development of a vaccine and to target the mosquito blamed for spreading the virus.""We're doing everything we can to speed that up,"" National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins told Senate appropriators on Thursday, though he said a vaccine probably won't be generally available until 2018.Just 18 percent of Americans in an Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey say they've heard a lot about Zika, which has been linked to serious birth defects in Latin American countries and a syndrome that can cause paralysis.The virus has also been detected in Puerto Rico and some sexually transmitted cases have been recorded in the U.S., and it could puncture deeper into the mainland in coming months.Yet Americans are not worried, with nearly half of those aware of the disease saying they are ""only a little"" or ""not at all"" fearful a large number of cases in the coming year.Many Americans also are unaware that the disease can be spread through sexual contact, the survey found, or don't know that it has been linked to birth defects.Those polled were split over the U.S.'s ability to respond to the virus, overall. While 46 percent felt somewhat confident in its ability, about a quarter each said they were ""not at all"" confident or ""extremely/very"" confident.The domestic response is at the heart of an intensifying fight on Capitol Hill, where Democrats have backed the White House's request for $1.9 billion in new money to fight Zika.The White House said Wednesday it will reluctantly transfer $510 million from the Ebola fight and $79 million from other accounts to prop up research into a better diagnostic test and vaccine for Zika and bolster efforts to eradicate the pesky mosquito that carries the virus.Top Republicans had pressed for the shift in funds for months, rejecting the administration's pleas for new money and saying the Ebola account could be tapped, though the White House said it still wants $1.9 billion to fight Zika and replenish the Ebola account.Aid groups told Congress on Thursday that economic growth in Liberia might not return to pre-Ebola levels until 2020, and new health centers will be of little good if patients cannot traverse the country's muddy, crumbling roads, as West Africa copes with a series of flare-ups in the aftermath of the main outbreak that killed 11,000 from December 2013 to late 2015.Senate Democrats used their testimony to their push for more funding.""We need to continue to do engaged and purposeful oversight, and we need to continue to invest in strengthening the public health systems in West Africa, or we will see Ebola reemerge as a major global threat,"" said Sen. Chris Coons, Delaware Democrat, after the hearing before the Foreign Affairs Committee's panel on Africa and global health.Witnesses who testified before the subcommittee were reluctant to inject themselves into the funding debate, however, citing their lack of involvement in the Zika fight.""It's a bit of a moral maze,"" said Alan Knight, chairman of the Ebola Private Sector Mobilization Group. ""But if the question is, 'Have we done enough to stop Ebola happening Liberia, have we done enough to create the right momentum toward economic recovery in Liberia?' The answer is no."" ","washingtontimes","right","16898","zika",605
"Would it be wrong to hope it goes for Mitch McConnell?It's Thursday, July 14, and Day 152 since Justice Antonin Scalia died and Mitch McConnell laid down his Supreme Court blockade: No meetings, no hearings, no votes on his replacement. It's also Day 115 since President Obama named Merrick Garland to be Scalia's replacement. What's the Senate doing today instead of considering the Supreme Court nominee? Yes, another Zika fight. Because McConnell's favorite tactic is to vote over and over and over and over on the same thing that keeps failing. It rarely changes the outcome, but it does have the advantage for him of making the Senate look busy. Meanwhile, this reminder from Politico.Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland may be the most prominent casualty of the GOP-controlled Senate's election-year resistance on the federal judiciary-but the pace of overall judicial confirmations under Mitch McConnell is on track to become the slowest in more than 60 years.Under the McConnell-led Senate, just 20 district and circuit court judges have been confirmed at a time when the vacancies are hampering the federal bench nationwide, according to the Congressional Research Service. During George W. Bush's final two years in the White House, Senate Democrats in the majority shepherded through 68 federal judges - a courtesy that Democrats now complain Republicans aren't affording to President Barack Obama, even though Obama has had more judges confirmed overall. []In 2015, the Republican Senate majority ushered through confirmations for 11 circuit and district court judges. So far in 2016, nine have been confirmed. That's 20 confirmed this Congress - the lowest number since the 82nd Congress in 1951-52, which confirmed just 18 judges, according to the Congressional Research Service. Harry S. Truman was president at the time. The CRS retains data on judicial confirmations dating to 1945.The reason President Obama has had more judges confirmed overall than his predecessor is because there have been so many more vacancies to fill during his tenure. Right now, there are 89 vacancies in federal courts. At this point in George W. Bush's term, there were less than half as many, around 40. There might be a few pushed through under McConnell, because he has plenty of Republicans who would like to have the confirmations in their own states to tout.But as of now, McConnell's desire to thwart Obama at every turn seems to be overcoming his desire to help his own team. Consider a nomination in Utah, where ""the senior [] senator said he is bending McConnell's ear, trying to secure a confirmation vote for Russell. But McConnell has been noncommittal to Hatch, simply responding: 'We'll see,' according to the senator's retelling.""Helluva way to run a country.Please donate $3 today to help turn the Senate blue. The future of the Supreme Court depends on it.","dailykos","left","16996","zika",456
"On his flight home from Mexico last week, Pope Francis declared that contraception could be permissible in areas afflicted with the Zika virus because of the growing evidence linking it to serious birth defects. Contraception is currently banned by the Catholic Church and the Pope's comment made big waves in the worldwide Catholic community. In fact, Rev. Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said shortly after the Pope's interview went public that the Pope was speaking only of exceptional circumstances. The pope, he said, was simply saying that in, ""situations of grave urgency, a well-formed conscience can see if there is the possibility or necessity of recourse [to] contraception or condoms.""The Pope's directive may seem like a big, benevolent step for the Catholic Church and it may be globally, but it will have little effect on U.S.-based Catholics. According to a poll by the Pew Research Center published last fall, 66% of self-identified American Catholics said they don't believe it is a sin to use contraceptives and they actually reject the prohibition on contraception. Personally, I do think the Pope's message was progressive, even for an American audience. As a result, he deserves any accolades he receives and none of the internal criticism because for the first time, the Catholic Church is actually respecting a woman's right to make broader decisions about her own body. That, in itself, is an unfortunate revelation. It is a shame, however, that the church would take this progressive step in response to Zika, but still reject a woman's right to abortion in extreme circumstances.The current Zika outbreak emerged in Brazil and is now exploding across Latin America and the Caribbean. The virus is reportedly responsible for a huge increase in microcephaly, a congenital condition that causes devastating birth defects in which babies' brains do not develop normally. Severe microcephaly causes children to be born with very small heads and brains and can cause a range of other health problems depending on the severity of the microcephaly. Problems these children face can include seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, feeding problems, hearing loss, and vision problems. The spread of the virus has been blamed on mosquitos, similarly to other prominent diseases in the region such as Dengue Fever and Malaria. The only difference in the case of Zika is that it can also be spread through human sexual contact.In fact, a case emerged in Texas last week that pointed towards the virus' spread through sexual contact, which may have prompted the Pope's immediate response to remove the ban on contraception worldwide. The main evidence in the Zika investigation, however, points to the mosquito as the culprit, and is starting to show that the virus is progressing (along with Dengue and Yellow Fever) in areas where there are large amounts of standing water, largely a result of a recent El Nino event that brought massive downpours to Brazil. This trend, of course, disproportionately affects the poor who may sleep with open windows because they don't have air-conditioning and whose neighborhoods might have more standing water due to inadequate sanitation.What if Zika Takes Hold in the United States?Will the current discussion about defunding family planning die down? Will we suddenly subsidize contraception for the poor, as Brazil has done, to prevent the spread of microcephaly cases? In the United States, access to contraception is often dictated by financial status and as a result the poor are often the most directly affected. In addition, certain studies show that access to contraception can dramatically improve women's lives.A recent Guttmacher Institute study showed that a majority of women claimed birth control enabled them to better support themselves financially (56 percent), complete their education (51 percent), take better care of themselves and their families (63 percent), and get or keep a job (50 percent). Among women with incomes under $75,000, 44 percent stated that they want to limit or delay their childbearing because of economic hardship. It's a common misconception that birth control is easy to come by and affordable. It is, in fact, just the opposite -- especially for those without health insurance. The ACA was intended to make insurance available to all U.S. citizens but only when combined with expanded Medicaid, the health care insurer for those with the lowest income in the US.  Traditionally Medicaid has provided health care to people in the United States only under certain circumstances. These are often referred to as ""low income and"" meaning that in order to qualify for Medicaid, subscribers had to meet not only an income threshold, but also another indicator. Most often this meant low income and pregnant, or low income and a minor, or low income and disabled. Medicaid expansion was meant to provide Medicaid to those who need it based solely on income.Currently 19 states have elected not to expand Medicaid and this has left a gap in coverage for those who cannot meet one of the additional requirements for Medicaid coverage and cannot afford to buy insurance through the exchanges. Ironically, this means in order to qualify for birth control coverage, women in this circumstance must choose to get pregnant in order to obtain health insurance.In 2012, the Center for American Progress found that for uninsured Americans, the potential annual cost of oral contraceptives alone was $1,210, an impossibly large sum for those living under the poverty line. If Zika were to take hold in the US, it is the poor who would be most at risk of being affected by the virus and in many cases would be left with few to no resources to combat it.The U.S. already has one of the highest infant mortality rates among the 14 wealthiest countries in the world. This trend is largely a result economic inequality -- often associated with poor housing developments and toxic environments. Add Zika to the mix in the US and suddenly that trend expands to include increased rates of microcephaly and physical deformities for those babies that do survive. It seems increased access to contraception provides the simplest solution to the complicated problems presented by Zika, and something we can all agree will make the biggest difference in preventing illnesses and improving quality of life.*image credit: Tânia Rêgo/ABr (Agência Brasil) [CC BY 3.0 br ( via Wikimedia Commons","huffingtonpost","left","16856","zika",1073
"This guy, who can't get even the most critical legislation out of the people he's supposed to be leading, deserves the blame.There are levels of hypocrisy that threaten to drag a scream from anyone paying the least bit of attention. Then there are levels of hypocrisy that threaten lives. Four months after President Obama requested funding to fight the looming threat of Zika, Republicans are working hard-not to address the crisis, but to milk it for any possible political advantage.The feud on Capitol Hill over responding to the rapidly spreading Zika virus would seem to be largely a fight over how much money is needed to fight the mosquito-borne scourge.But lurking just beneath the surface are issues that have long stirred partisan mistrust, including Republicans' fears about the use of taxpayer money for abortion and possible increased use of contraception, and Democratic worries about protecting the environment from potentially dangerous pesticides.Public health officials warn that the virus will not stop to check party affiliation - the mosquitoes that carry it bite Republicans and Democrats alike.No. Wrong. And David Herszenhorn at the New York Times, this mentions you by name because of Just How Wrong It Is. Dammit. This blatant example of ""both sides do it,"" when both sides are so not doing it, is going to cost lives. This is not a damn game, and it's not time to play some silly ""we must always find a reason to share the blame"" show of journalistic spinelessness. Stop it. Just stop it.First, Republicans are not fearful that Zika funding will be used to fund abortions, because the law already prohibits that use. That's just nonsense. What Republicans are doing is looking for angles by which they can make it appear that Democrats are trying to use this funding to support abortion. They know it's not possible. You know it's not possible. Stop pretending this is a real concern and not a talking point. If Republicans were actually concerned about unborn children, they'd be worried about the 157 pregnant women already known to be infected with Zika in the United States. They'd be worried about the children already being born with microcephaly in Puerto Rico. But they're not.","dailykos","left","16946","zika",372
"Sen. Roy Blunt (R. MO)One more GOP asshole that needs to lose in November:The Missouri Democratic Party on Wednesday increased attacks on Republican Sen. Roy Blunt over the failure of a $1.1 billion bill he'd helped craft to combat the Zika virus.Blunt is in a tighter-than-expected fight to defend his Senate seat against Democratic Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, and the state's Democrats were quick to implicate Blunt in the implosion of bipartisan talks on the Zika bill.They accused him of skipping out on negotiations to attend two fundraisers the same night that Republicans filed a final version of the bill.That version included provisions that Senate Democrats said they couldn't support, including language that would impose restrictions on Zika funds going to Planned Parenthood, soften regulations on pesticide use and cut funds for Obamacare and Ebola research.Democrats in the Senate voted to block the final bill Tuesday, effectively ending hope that Congress would allocate money for Zika prevention or research before the height of mosquito season.""Unfortunately for Missourians, raising money from lobbyists is clearly more important to Sen. Blunt than protecting Missouri families from this threat,"" Will Baskin-Gerwitz, Missouri Democratic Party spokesman, said in a statement.Baskin-Gerwitz cited a leaked fundraising email that listed two events for Blunt on June 22, the night the compromise bill was filed in the House of Representatives: a 5:30 p.m. reception starring Blunt and Republican Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and John McCain of Arizona at a townhouse in Washington and a dinner to raise money for Blunt's campaign committee from 6:30 to 8 p.m. at an Italian restaurant downtown with Republican Sen.

"A House-passed deal to combat the Zika virus might be doomed in the Senate, where Democrats say it is not enough to stem the mosquito-borne threat and help pregnant women whose unborn children might develop defects in the womb.House Republican leaders brushed aside a Democratic ""sit-in"" over guns early Thursday and ushered the $1.1 billion measure to passage, 239-171, as part of a broader spending bill that funds military construction and veterans programs.But the White House blasted the package as ""four months late and nearly a billion dollars short"" of its request for $1.9 billion, issuing a veto threat, while Senate Democrats threatened a filibuster ahead of a test vote early next week.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said provisions that bar funding for Planned Parenthood will hamper efforts to stop the disease, which can be spread sexually and has been linked to microcephaly - a condition in which infants are born with abnormally small heads.""This is all some women have. That's the only care they have, the only place they can go,""  the Nevada Democrat said of Planned Parenthood, a women's health clinic and abortion provider that's been mired in controversy since undercover videos purported to show officials negotiating the sale of fetal body parts.The impasse leaves little room for compromise after months of bitter negotiations, and there is little time to act before the party nominating conventions in mid-July.

Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said. ","washingtontimes","right","16975","zika",570
"Three babies have been born in the United States with birth defects linked to likely Zika virus infections in the mothers during pregnancy, along with three cases of lost pregnancies linked to Zika, federal health officials said on Thursday.The six cases reported as of June 9 were included in a new U.S. Zika pregnancy registry created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency said it will begin regular reporting of poor outcomes of pregnancies with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.Zika has caused alarm throughout the Americas since numerous cases of the birth defect microcephaly linked to the mosquito-borne virus were reported in Brazil, the country hardest hit by the current outbreak. The rare birth defect is marked by unusually small head size and potentially severe developmental problems.The U.S. cases so far involve women who contracted the virus outside the United States in areas with active Zika outbreaks, or were infected through unprotected sex with an infected partner. There have not yet been any cases reported of local transmission of the virus in the United States. Health experts expect local transmission to occur as mosquito season gets underway with warmer weather, especially in Gulf Coast states, such as Florida and Texas.The CDC declined to provide details of the three cases it reported on Thursday, but said all had brain abnormalities consistent with congenital Zika virus infection. Two U.S. cases of babies with microcephaly previously were reported in Hawaii and New Jersey.The poor birth outcomes reported include those known to be caused by Zika, such as microcephaly and other severe fetal defects, including calcium deposits in the brain indicating possible brain damage, excess fluid in the brain cavities and surrounding the brain, absent or poorly formed brain structures and abnormal eye development, the CDC said.""The pattern that we're seeing here in the U.S. among travelers is very similar to what we're seeing in other places like Colombia and Brazil,"" Dr. Denise Jamieson, co-leader of the CDC Zika pregnancy task force, said in a telephone interview.Authorities in Brazil have confirmed more than 1,400 cases of microcephaly in babies whose mothers were exposed to Zika during pregnancy.Lost pregnancies include miscarriage, stillbirths and terminations with evidence of the birth defects. The CDC did not specify the nature of the three reported lost pregnancies, citing privacy concerns about pregnancy outcomes.The CDC established its registry to monitor pregnancies for a broad range of poor outcomes linked to Zika. It said it plans to issue updated reports every Thursday intended to ensure that information about pregnancy outcomes linked with the Zika virus is publicly available.The CDC said the information is essential for planning for clinical, public health and other services needed to support pregnant women and families affected by Zika.""We're hoping this underscores the importance of pregnant women not traveling to areas of ongoing Zika virus transmission if possible, and if they do need to travel to ensure that they avoid mosquito bites and the risk of sexual transmission,"" Jamieson said.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Will Dunham)","huffingtonpost","left","16968","zika",549
"WASHINGTON -- Republicans added a series of poison pills to a bill to fund the government's Zika response so they could satisfy the party's ""crazies,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) charged on Wednesday.Reid made that claim a day after Democrats blocked the Zika funding, citing GOP-crafted riders in the spending bill the House passed last week that promoted the Confederate flag, obstructed contraceptive services for women and weakened clean water rules, among other things.Democrats did so, Reid said, because the Republican-led House operates under an informal standard called the ""Hastert Rule"" -- which, Reid noted, is named after former GOP Speaker Dennis Hastert, who is serving time for crimes related to his sexual abuse of boys. The Hastert Rule demands that any legislation that comes to the floor must have the support of a majority of Republicans.In the post-tea party era, it can be difficult to get that majority. And, Reid argued, that is why the House GOP had to go to absurd lengths to win over enough of its members before bringing the legislation up for a vote last week, in the middle of the Democrats' sit-in over gun legislation.""As could only be understood by understanding what the Hastert Rule is, here's what they did,"" Reid said. ""They had to get all of the crazies over there,"" he said.""They did everything they could to go after all the pet projects of Republicans,"" he added, explaining why the Zika bill prevents money from going to groups like Planned Parenthood. ""This Zika -- young women are concerned about birth control. For a majority of young women, this is the only place they have to go,"" Reid said. ""But what did [Republicans] do? They said we're going to restrict funding for birth control provided by Planned Parenthood. Why would they do that? Only to get votes from the crazies over there.""Reid also noted that a provision in the bill -- which was attached to a larger spending measure to fund veterans' programs and military construction -- exempts pesticide spraying from clean water rules. However, Zika-carrying mosquitoes breed in flower pots and discarded bottle caps, not in the open water governed by those rules.And then there's a provision repealing a law that banned Confederate flags in veterans' cemeteries.""I guess they had to make sure they had all the Southern votes,"" Reid said. ""If they got their way, you could fly Confederate flags on any military cemetery you wanted.""The Democrat made his remarks on the Senate floor just after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R) opened the session by blaming Democrats for stopping the Zika measure that they and the White House had been seeking since February.""They demanded congressional action on Zika,"" McConnell said. ""Then, in the midst of mosquito season, Democrats chose partisan politics over $1.1 billion in critical funds to protect pregnant women and babies from Zika, after -- and listen to this, colleagues -- after Democrats voted for the same $1.1 billion funding level just last month.""McConnell did not mention that the bill Democrats backed last month lacked all the riders that Reid is complaining about. Those were added in what's known as a conference committee, formed when the House and Senate each pass the same bill, but with different provisions.Democrats were excluded from the conference report on Zika, which the House passed amid their sit-in on guns.McConnell said he will bring the rider-laden bill back up for another vote after the July 4 break.Nearly 2,700 people in the United States and its territories have the Zika virus, including nearly 500 pregnant women. The ailment is especially damaging during pregnancies, leading to a birth defect known as microcephaly in developing infants.Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to reflect more specifically the crimes of which Hastert was convicted.","huffingtonpost","left","16981","zika",665
"Ten pregnant women tested positive with preliminary testing for Zika in Dallas County. The good news is they all contracted the virus outside of the United States.Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) Director Zachary Thompson announced 10 pregnant women traveled to Zika hot spots and appear to have returned with the virus. Thompson spoke to the Dallas County Commissioners Court, the Dallas Morning News reported Tuesday.Medical officials test locally to determine the exposure to the Zika virus and, in some cases, send samples to the CDC for confirmation. Breitbart Texas reported in May that the FDA had approved new test that provides early detection of the Zika virus.""We're tracking 10 pregnant women with possible Zika infection,"" said Thompson. ""But no confirmation has been made at this time. Testing was performed at the Dallas County Health and Human Services laboratory, and sent to CDC for additional testing.""He added: ""We don't want a localized case.""In April, an El Salvadorian pregnant woman, who resides in Houston, tested positive for Zika, Breitbart Texas' Lana Shadwick reported.To date, all cases originated from travel outside the U.S. to Zika infested regions or were transmitted through sexual contact with an infected person who traveled to predominantly Latin American countries where Zika runs rampant.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 234 pregnant women in the U.S. tested positive for Zika. Another 189 tested positive in U.S. territories. So far, three babies were born exhibiting Zika related birth defects. Three other pregnancies ended in miscarriages and stillbirths, with evidence of suspected Zika related birth defects including microcephaly, calcium deposits in the brain indicating possible brain damage, excess fluid in the brain cavities and surrounding the brain, absent or poorly formed brain structures, abnormal eye development, or other problems resulting from brain damage affecting nerves, muscles and bones, such as clubfoot or inflexible joints, says the CDC.For most who contract Zika, symptoms last up to a week and are mild. They include fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. However, the virus has also been linked to serious health complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune system disorder that causes severe joint and muscle pain.Dallas County officials remain concerned over the possibility of local mosquitoes biting an infected patient, in turn, infecting the local mosquito population. This would trigger a ""transmission cycle,"" which Breitbart Texas' Bob Price reported.In February, Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, chief of pediatric infectious diseases for the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and a director of infectious diseases at Children's Medical Center voiced that such a ""transmission cycle"" could start in Texas. The Aedes aegypti mosquito which carries Zika is native to the state. Should local mosquitoes get infected with the virus, Kahn noted it would be ""almost impossible to get the virus out of the population.""On Tuesday, Thompson added: ""It's not if we're going to have one but when we're going to have one. And what impact that's going to have on our residents, especially the fear among pregnant women.""Local health officials previously confirmed nine Zika cases. None of the patients were pregnant. Most contracted the virus through mosquito bites while on travel to countries like Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, and Venezuela.The largely mosquito-borne transmittable virus can also be contracted through sexual contact with an infected person. Breitbart Texas reported the first U.S. case of hetero-sexually transmitted Zika happened in Dallas County. So did the nation's first homosexually transmitted case, as reported by Breitbart Texas.Thompson told county commissioners Tuesday the nine cases since cleared up, according to the Dallas newspaper. The DCHHS director recommended those planning to visit a Zika affected country should speak to their doctors before traveling, including to places like Brazil, the site of the 2016 Summer Olympics.Although there is no vaccine to prevent Zika, the FDA just green-lighted Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life Science, makers of the first DNA-based vaccine, to begin a first phase of clinical testing within weeks. Breitbart Texas reported Brazil and the University of Texas signed an agreement to develop a vaccine. Dallas labs and Houston medical institutions stand on the forefront of early Zika testing.For now, prevention remains key. DCHHS official Dr. Christopher Perkins stressed ""education and awareness"" crucial in preventing Zika. ""Patients are highly encouraged to follow prevention recommendations to avoid transmitting and spreading Zika virus.""Thompson reiterated Tuesday prevention starts with wearing mosquito repellent ""all day every day."" He suggested limiting time outdoors at night, reminded Dallasites to remove standing water, and to use condoms when having sex with someone who traveled abroad.Dr. Patrick Ramsey, the South Texas vice chair of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told the Morning News women should use mosquito repellent all the time; pregnant women, too. He called bug sprays safe for pregnant women to use.Thompson noted the same Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry Zika transmit West Nile virus, a major concern to local health officials. Five mosquito pools tested positive for the virus so far this year, Thompson said. ""We still feel that West Nile's public enemy No. 1.""Editor's Note: This article has been updated with additional information., a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16975","zika",881
"By Tom MilesGENEVA (Reuters) - Tests show an outbreak of Zika virus on the African island chain of Cape Verde is of the same strain as the one blamed for birth abnormalities in Brazil, the World Health Organization said on Friday.""The findings are of concern because it is further proof that the outbreak is spreading beyond South America and is on the doorstep of Africa,"" said WHO's Africa director Matshidiso Moeti.""This information will help African countries to re-evaluate their level of risk and adapt and increase their levels of preparedness,"" she said.Zika was first discovered in Africa in 1947 and until the past year it was thought to cause only mild symptoms with no known link with brain or birth disorders. Researchers identified two distinct lineages in 2012, African and Asian.As of May 8, there had been 7,557 suspected cases in Cape Verde, an Atlantic archipelago around 570 km (350 miles) west of Senegal, which has historic ties to Brazil.Until the virus was sequenced by the Institut Pasteur in Senegal, it was not certain if the outbreak was caused by the African or Asian type, which has hit Brazil and other Latin American countries.Moeti said she would not recommend strict travel restrictions to try to stop the spread of the disease further into Africa, but advocated efforts to control mosquito numbers and stop people being bitten.Bruce Aylward, head of outbreaks and health emergencies at WHO, said it remained to be seen if African populations would have some immunity to the virus which could mitigate the impact of aZika outbreak on the continent.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.The WHO has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last year in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,300 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.Cape Verde has reported three cases of microcephaly, and a mother thought to have caught Zika there later delivered a microcephalic baby in the United States. Cape Verde has not reported any cases of Guillain-Barre, WHO said.(Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Andrew Roche)","huffingtonpost","left","16941","zika",427
"A 24-year-old Brazilian journalist says she is a ""fulfilled, happy woman"" despite her lifelong struggle with microcephaly, and that she has ""taken personally"" the promotion of abortions in cases like hers from leftist groups, following the discovery of a link between microcephaly and the pervasive Zika virus.""When I read a report about the project by the [Brazilian] Supreme Federal Court to allow abortion in microcephaly cases, I took it personally,"" Ana Carolina Caceres told the BBC. ""I felt attacked and offended.""Caceres says her parents did not know she would have microcephaly until she was born. They were told ""I wouldn't walk, I wouldn't talk and, with time, I would enter a vegetative state until I died."" Caceres underwent five operations to protect her brain, one nine days after her birth. ""I grew up, went to school, graduated, and went to university,"" she says. ""Now I am a journalist and write for a blog."" Caceres notes that she sees her role in life as one of ""giving a voice"" to those with microcephaly, and has written a book about her life and the lives of five other adults who struggle with microcephaly.Microcephaly is a condition in which an infant's skull is too small for his or her brain, often crushing or otherwise severely damaging the brain. 85 percent of children with this condition suffer some sort of neurological disability or retardation, and most will suffer convulsions, which Caceres says she now controls with prescription medication. Many children born with microcephaly die young, but experts agree that the possibilities of survival for a child are only fully understood as doctor's monitor the child's development.Medical experts in Brazil have found that a pregnant woman contracting Zika, a virus of African origin spread through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, has a much higher rate of producing a child with microcephaly. The Brazilian government has documented more than 4,000 cases of infants born with microcephaly to mothers with Zika in their bloodstream in the past year, as of January 27.""Those who opt for abortion do not give the child a chance to survive, as happened with me and with many people who work, study, and do normal things the mothers of these people did not choose abortion, and that is why we exist,"" Caceres says.She compares abortion in cases of Zika contamination to abortion children diagnosed with other severe disabilities. ""The right thing would be to invest in treatment and attention for these babies Do we want to now abort children diagnosed with Down Syndrome or other similar syndromes?"" Instead of abortion, Caceres suggests investing in treatment and resources for the parents of children with microcephaly, and advises mothers whose children are affected to seek each other out in their communities or on social media.Leftist organizations have used the Zika virus, which poses a significantly more minor threat to adults than the unborn, to urge Latin America to legalize abortions. The region is home to some of the world's strictest laws protecting the right to life, partially due to centuries of Catholic tradition.Not allowing abortions in Zika cases while governments encourage women to avoid pregnancies - wrote Angélica María Rivas, who works for a Salvadorian group allied with Planned Parenthood this week - creates ""a mental health issue for women."" ""Governments cannot, on the one hand, discourage pregnancy, while at the same time limiting their commitments to and funding for family planning and access to safe and legal abortion,"" Planned Parenthood's Latin America director Dee Redwine added.Leftists in Latin American publications have made similar arguments. The pro-abortin NGO Women's Link Worldwide called warnings against pregnancies in the region ""unrealistic"" without easy access to abortion. ""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,"" sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy writes in O Globo.The push for more abortions appears to be working, as Brazilian officials report an increase in the number of illegal abortions since Zika was first publicized to have a link to microcephaly in December.At least one Brazilian judge has stated he would grant legal abortions to women testing positive for Zika who can prove with a doctor's note that experts believe their child would die at birth.In addition to those who support the right to life, at least one expert believes that legalized abortions may have played a role in how slowly the world has reacted to the threat of the Zika virus. Gubio Soares, the researcher who first identified the presence of Zika in Brazil in April 2015, said in a lecture that, as one of the regions first affected by Zika allows legal abortions, many children who would have been born with microcephaly were aborted, distorting the data regarding the number of microcephaly cases linked to Zika. Only when Zika hit in a nation that does not allow abortions in most circumstances (Brazil), could scientists see a clear pattern between the presence of the virus and the occurrence of microcephaly. ""It is necessary to review the number of abortions in French Polynesia,"" he said, citing the region in question.","breitbart","right","16834","zika",876
"US health officials have concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women causes birth defect microcephaly and other brain abnormalities in babies.""It is now clear that Zika virus does cause microcephaly,"" said Tom Frieden, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe first U.S. Zika-related death was confirmed by health officials in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The man who was in his seventies died due to a rare Zika complication known as Thrombocytopenic purpura, an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the blood cells known as platelets instead of the Zika virus-killing the host.The Caribbean island has reported 683 confirmed cases of Zika, including 65 pregnant women with symptoms of the virus, according to the CDC<U+200B>.Of the confirmed cases, five patients developed Guillain-Barre syndrome and were hospitalized. Zika first began spreading in Puerto Rico in December.The New York Times reports on why Puerto Rico is so vulnerable to Zika.The outbreak is expected to be worse here than anywhere else in the country. The island, a warm, wet paradise veined with gritty poverty, is the ideal environment for the mosquitoes carrying the virus. The landscape is littered with abandoned houses and discarded tires that are perfect breeding grounds for the insects. Some homes and schools lack window screens and air-conditioning, exposing residents to almost constant bites.The economy is in shambles, and thousands of civic workers needed to fight mosquitoes have been laid off. The chemical most often used against the adult pests no longer works, and the one needed to control their larvae has been pulled from the market by regulators.A quarter of the island's 3.5 million people will probably get the Zika virus within a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and eventually 80 percent or more may be infected.""I'm very concerned,"" Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C. director, said in an interview after a recent three-day visit to Puerto Rico. ""There could be thousands of infections of pregnant women this year.""The poor in Puerto Rico live in housing that often does not have window screening. A looming disaster will unfold as mosquitos will have easy access to human blood.Cuba has reported its first case, and mosquitos infected with the virus will now begin to transmit the virus to the population.Havana is 90 miles from Key West and Florida Governor Rick Scott has declared a state of emergency in four counties with confirmed cases. Like San Juan, Key West, Miami and Fort Lauderdale all have open doors and windows in restaurants and bars during the tourist season when the weather is pleasant. Unlike the poor in the Caribbean and South America, window screening and air conditioning are readily available during the steamy and rainy months.The Gulf Coast, a region of 60 million people, could find itself unprepared and at ground zero for a  mosquito-borne Zika epidemic. The CDC is very concerned and believes that May, June, and into the summer months is when we could start seeing Zika transmission on the Gulf Coast. And it could be very bad. Dr. Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D., dean of the Baylor College of Medicine National School of Tropical Medicine-who believes that the island of Haiti will be decimated as well as many poor areas in the Gulf coast-explains.Poverty is important because of the fact that people live in poor-quality dwellings without window screens, or holes in the window screens - I think that is a big one.  I think another big one is the fact that it is not just the window screens but the immediate environment around the house in these poor areas - you see environmental degradation, you see uncollected garbage, you see standing bodies of water such as undrained ditches as well as in containers, discarded tires along the side of the road - and so these are the reasons, because all of them are perfect for harboring the Aedes aegypti mosquito.So it is the poor areas I am most concerned about, which includes Haiti, for instance. I think Haiti is going to get decimated.  I am very worried about Haiti.  I'm worried about the whole region, but especially about places like Haiti, for the same reasons I am worried about the Gulf Coast, especially the poor areas. Some of the historic wards of Houston - like the 5th ward,  Sunnyside - all these places are vulnerable, and that is part of the conversation that you are not really hearing. You are hearing mostly that the West, particularly the U.S., is wealthy, and therefore we don't have to worry, but I put an asterisk on that and say yes, but the Gulf Coast has an extreme level of poverty that we don't see in many other parts of the country, and that is uniquely vulnerable to Zika.In Brazil, a study in Brazil that suggests that Zika can cause paralysis.Meanwhile, doctors are also looking into whether Zika caused of a spike in Guillain-Barre cases that occurred in Brazil during Zika outbreaks.  Guillain-Barre syndrome is an unusual illness in which a person's immune system damages peripheral nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. Most cases are in adults. Symptoms usually start in the legs and can last a few weeks or several months. Most people fully recover, but some have permanent damage. An estimated 1 in 20 people with the condition die, usually when the paralysis affects muscles that control breathing.  The CDC<U+200B> reports on a case of male-to-male sexual transmission of the Zika Virus in Texas.In January 2016, after notification from a local health care provider, an investigation by Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) identified a case of sexual transmission of Zika virus between a man with recent travel to an area of active Zika virus transmission (patient A) and his nontraveling male partner (patient B). At this time, there had been one prior case report of sexual transmission of Zika virus (1). The present case report indicates Zika virus can be transmitted through anal sex, as well as vaginal sex. Identification and investigation of cases of sexual transmission of Zika virus in nonendemic areas present valuable opportunities to inform recommendations to prevent sexual transmission of Zika virus.The sports world is beginning to cancel events in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in Latin America.Major League Baseball<U+200B> and the players' association has cancelled games that were set to be played in San Juan between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Miami Marlins. Players from both teams had expressed fear in traveling to the island.The Knicks, Carmelo<U+200B> Anthony who is expected to be the first American basketball athlete to win 3 gold medals in Rio this summer, had a eye popping moment when he was asked whether he will go to the games.""I don't even know what a Zika Virus is, but I'll tell you what: it scares me when I hear about it. But I'll see pictures and you just talked about it. With Brazil, they're trying to impeach their president. There's so much that goes into that decisionSafety is foremost.""The US National Soccer<U+200B> Team has fears of traveling to Puerto Rico and may cancel their participation in the pre-Copa America Centenario.The Brazilian government has hired more than 200,000 people to help educate the population and assist them by cleaning areas of stagnant water. But in the midst of an epidemic, people throughout the world will be reassessing their decision to travel to the 2016 games. The athletes, most of whom are in their teens, twenties and thirties are or will be planning families, they have every reason to be fearful.xYouTube VideoAccuweather<U+200B> reports on what to expect on the weather conditions during July and August in Rio.""Humidity levels are slightly lower than in the summer, but it's still considered a tropical climate, and therefore it can still be classified as being humid most days,"" Miller said.However, even though it will be Brazil's winter, temperatures will remain high enough for mosquitoes to complete development, according to Brown.Even the smallest amounts of water can still bring mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti larvae can complete development in less than a teaspoon of water, experts say.Miller said that rainfall is at a minimum in July in Rio and only slightly higher in August, typically increasing toward the end of the month.""Rainfall averages only about 3.5-4 inches (approximately 90-100 mm) during those two months combined,"" Miller said.","dailykos","left","16930","zika",1416
"WASHINGTON -- A spending bill that included cash to combat the Zika virus failed in the Senate Tuesday, mired in partisan add-ons that targeted women's health service providers and sought to allow the flying of the Confederate flag.The $1.1 billion in funding for the nation's Zika response was attached to a larger funding bill that would pay for military construction and veterans affairs.That measure had passed in the Senate on a bipartisan vote earlier in the year, but it differed from the version that passed the House, which had less money for combatting the disease.To align the separate measures, Republicans in both chambers working in a conference committee wrote a new version of the bill that excluded Democrats' concerns. It passed on a party line with no hearings or debate in the House last week while Democrats staged a sit-in there over guns.The GOP bill would pay for the Zika response with $750 million in cuts elsewhere, including taking more than $100 million from the Ebola response, and more than $500 million from an Affordable Care Act fund.It also bars the money from going to contraceptive services for women in Zika-afflicted areas, and to groups such as Planned Parenthood. Zika is most threatening to pregnant women, whose babies can suffer from microcephaly and other irreversible problems while they are in the womb. There are nearly 2,700 people infected with the virus in the United States and its territories, including nearly 500 pregnant women. The GOP version of the bill also eliminates a rule that bars the flying of Confederate flags at veterans' cemeteries. Further, it waives environmental rules to allow the increased spraying of pesticides in waterways, although Zika-carrying mosquitoes do not breed in moving rivers and ponds. They prefer stagnant water, such as in old tires, cans or bottle caps.The bill needed 60 votes to advance, but only got 52. No Democrats voted for it. Two Republicans, Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and James Lankford (Okla.), also voted against the bill.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) expressed outrage at the failed vote.""Here we are in an utterly absurd position, of playing political games, as this public health crisis mounts in our country,"" McConnell said, adding that he will bring the bill back after the July 4 break. ""I hope that our Democratic friends, upon reflection ... will come back with a different attitude.""The bill is also $800 million short of the $1.9 billion the White House asked for in February.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) countered McConnell by saying that the Democrats had tried repeatedly to pass Zika funding, but Republicans objected five times, including once when they tried to use Zika to extract cuts to Obamacare.""I don't know what universe my friend is living in. What does he think, we're all stupid, the American people are dumb? They're not, they understand what's going on here,"" Reid said, arguing that Republicans were trying to extract as many partisan concessions for their base as they could.""I've been here a long time. I don't ever remember anything as outrageous, as shameful as this piece of legislation,"" Reid said.","huffingtonpost","left","16980","zika",542
"Modern biology needs tools.  One of the most controversial of those tools has proven to be crucial to explaining how the Zika virus causes brain damage in newborns.Zika is poised to dwarf the threat of Ebola, which was never a significant danger to the United States in spite of the cable news-induced hysteria.  But Zika is a different story.  Public health officials expect the virus to spread in the southern states this spring partly owing to extensive travel to and from South America.  It is already a serious problem in Puerto Rico.  With the disease-carrying mosquito likely to be seen in the U.S. mainland soon, the White House will hold a one-day summit on the problem this spring.Understanding the mechanism of Zika could open a pathway to preventing the condition in infants.  Working together in an important experiment, scientists at several universities have found that the virus attacks stem cells early in pregnancy.  Some of these stem cells will become neurons and form the cortex, the outer layer of the brain.  It seems that the virus invades these cells, killing some and preventing others from dividing, which they must do to populate the fetal brain.  The cells that the scientists used to achieve this understanding would not have been available just ten years ago.  In 2007 a Japanese team found that it was possible to turn adult cells into highly potent stem cells that resemble embryonic stem cells, which have the ability to turn into all of the more than-200 kinds of cell in the adult human.  These induced pluripotent stem cells were the essential ingredients in the Zika virus experiment.But the debt to stem cell biology goes back still further, to 1998 when American scientists isolated human embryonic stem cells in the laboratory for the first time.  These embryonic stem cells then became the gold standard that allowed later investigators to see what they were aiming for in creating cells that did not need to be taken from an embryo.  Although the lab-grown cells don't seem to be perfectly similar to the ones from embryos, they have made it easier to do a wide range of experiments.Unfortunately, the road to the science behind the pluripotent cells was a painful one.  Before they were developed, the fact that a six-day old embryo was destroyed in the course of obtaining its stem cells led to a furious ethical and political battle.  Advocates noted that the few embryos required were in fertility clinics and were donated by couples who would never have used them.  Opponents found such reasoning grotesquely utilitarian and disrespectful of incipient human life.  This esoteric laboratory technique became a political issue in several presidential campaigns and numerous congressional races.Emotions on both sides ran high as the issue symbolized a struggle between the freedom of scientific inquiry and the value of even the smallest human being.  At the time it was easy to miss the fact that support for at least some stem cell research was bipartisan.  President Bill Clinton was in favor of it before his term ended.  President George W. Bush continued to fund embryonic stem cell research, albeit with severe limitations, and Senator John McCain refused to disavow it when he ran for president, which probably cost him the votes of some social conservatives.  Then President Obama expanded the list of stem cells that could be used in federally supported studies.  With some distance from that controversy it is possible to acknowledge both that induced pluripotent stem cells were an advance and that cells from embryos made it possible to get there.   No one could have predicted that stem cells would be so important for a crisis like this. If the recent experiments do lead to a treatment for the brain damage caused by the Zika virus, we will have learned an important lesson about the way that modern biology needs to progress.","huffingtonpost","left","16875","zika",672
"Health authorities in Brazil are warning couples to delay pregnancies as they treat thousands of cases of infant brain damage experts believe could be linked to the rare African Zika virus. Some suggest the virus made its appearance in Brazil through the high influx of tourists following the 2014 World Cup.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Pernambuco, told CNN. Officials have recorded over 2,400 cases of microcephaly, a disorder in infants in which the size of the brain is abnormally small, this year; for comparison, doctors recorded only 147 cases of microcephaly in 2014. 29 of the infants diagnosed with microcephaly in 2015 have died.Rocha tells CNN that ""a generation of babies"" is being affected in Pernambuco, the hardest-hit region of Brazil. Six states have declared a state of emergency over the matter. One of the infants was found to be carrying the Zika virus in their blood during an autopsy, and a number of the mothers reported symptoms characteristic of carrying the virus.According to Brazil's federal association of Obstetrician/Gynecologists, the symptoms of Zika contamination are ""like dengue fever, but less aggressive,"" and ""70 to 80 percent of patients are asymptomatic."" The Wall Street Journal notes that most adults who contract the Zika virus recover in about a week through ""bed rest and liquids,"" and symptoms include ""fever, rashes, headaches, joint aches and vomiting.""The similarities to diseases like dengue could lead to a number of patients not being recorded, receiving treatment for dengue fever instead and recovering. CNN notes the similarities in the symptoms are no coincidence: Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya virus are all the product of interactions with Aedes aegypti, a species of mosquito. Aedes aegypti lives in the southern areas of the United States, particularly Texas, where the crippling Chikungunya virus has been found.Zika virus, CNN notes, first surfaced in Uganda more than half a century ago, but was only identified in Brazil in early 2015, leading to the conclusion that tourists visiting for the 2014 World Cup were responsible for carrying it into a new continent. In addition to appearing in one of the infants diagnosed with microcephaly, Brazilian newspaper O Globo reports of an adult case of Zika being transmitted through a blood transfusion in Sao Paolo state. Brazilian hospitals screen blood donors for major diseases, like various forms of hepatitis and HIV, but have no way of testing for Zika. Officials confirmed with the newspaper that ""there is not currently a commercial test to identify the virus commercially available for use on a large scale."" This leaves open the possibility that a pregnant woman could receive the virus through a blood transfusion should she need one during the course of the pregnancy.Due to the El Niño weather phenomenon, O Globo warns that 2016 could bring the ""summer of Zika."" Temperatures are expected to be milder and more humid, which meteorologist Francisco de Assis Diniz described as ""music to a mosquito's ears.""Brazilians have taken the matter into their own hands, seeking more information on the virus. Matheus Pizão and Tatiana Viana, an expecting couple, have started the Twitter hashtag #SemZika (""without Zika"") to use as a resource for sharing information about identifying and avoiding Zika. ""Tatiana and I waited ten years to have our first child and we were horrified,"" Pizão explains to the newspaper. ""We doubled our precautions. But we also began to talk about what we could be doing so that others may take care, as well, not just those expecting.""There is currently no vaccine against Zika virus.","breitbart","right","16793","zika",613
"Dear Senator Rubio, Senator Cruz, and Mr. Trump,The growing public health crisis posed by the spread of the Zika virus demands the urgent attention of leaders at all levels of government, including those who seek our nation's highest office. As the clear frontrunners for the Republican presidential nomination, you each have a responsibility to help advance a nationwide dialogue on how best to respond to this global health emergency. This response must acknowledge that women across America--from both political parties--are rightfully concerned about the safety and advisability of becoming pregnant during a viral pandemic that has been linked to a rare and potentially deadly neurological disorder in infants. That is why I am asking you to put aside your ideological objections and support universal contraceptive coverage until we better understand the Zika virus and can control its outbreak.While I implore you to take action during this public health emergency, I understand that we may have very serious disagreements about how to improve the lives of women and families more broadly. NARAL Pro-Choice America believes that without access to the full range of reproductive health care and family planning services--especially contraception and abortion--millions of American women would be hamstrung and left without the tools to raise a happy and healthy family and to have a chance at achieving economic success. As candidates and lawmakers, you have attacked efforts to provide universal access to contraceptive coverage and stood against commonsense policies that empower women to make their own health decisions[1]. But the deadly reality of the Zika outbreak requires leaders to take bold action in the face of this public health crisis.As you know, some pregnant women diagnosed with Zika have been bearing children with microcephaly, a medical complication that can be fatal within the first few months of a child's life. Every parent deserves the chance to put their family's health first and to choose when and how they want to raise their children. Unfortunately, right now millions of American women don't know whether it would be healthy to become pregnant with the spread of the Zika virus, and they deserve to have the ability to delay a healthy pregnancy.While you have attacked universal contraceptive coverage in the past, I implore you to drop your opposition amidst this public health crisis so that women have the option to delay their pregnancy if they choose while we learn more about the threat posed by the Zika epidemic and how to contain it. I know that asking someone to re-examine their positions, no matter how ill-informed and dangerous they are, is a difficult ask. But I've seen it happen before in the face of a public health emergency. When the HIV/AIDS epidemic hit Indiana last spring, Governor Mike Pence dropped his long-held opposition to needle exchange because he knew he faced a public health crisis that could only be solved if he allowed this critical program to exist in the state. We're asking you to similarly put public health above partisan ideology and to take action to protect the health and safety of women and families across our country.Without universal access to contraception, women lack a critical tool for planning a healthy pregnancy. That's why it's critical for  you, as leaders in your party who each come from states where the Zika virus has been detected, to support universal contraceptive coverage for all women, at least until we learn more about this deadly virus and how to contain its spread. I hope that you will join me in standing up for American families as we grapple with this public health crisis.Ilyse HoguePresident, NARAL Pro-Choice AmericaView original letter here.","huffingtonpost","left","16836","zika",642
"Florida Gov. Rick Scott pleaded with President Obama on Wednesday to provide his state with mosquito traps, insecticide and other gear they need to fight the Zika virus, saying it is ""profoundly disappointing"" that Congress failed to pass a funding package before the start of hurricane season.Zika causes serious birth defects, and the Republican governor said his state's hot-and-wet climate is about to get a lot worse, allowing disease-carrying insects to flourish.""Despite repeated calls for action, Congress has failed to act and now they are on vacation,"" Mr. Scott wrote in a letter to Mr. Obama.Congress skipped town for a Memorial Day recess that will stretch into next week without reconciling competing measures to fund efforts to develop a better diagnostic test and vaccine for Zika and boost local mosquito efforts.The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to spend $1.1 billion in emergency money, with no corresponding cuts elsewhere, meaning the money is tacked onto the deficit. In the House, Republicans won passage of a bill to spend only a little more than $600 million through Sept. 30, with the money coming from elsewhere in the president's health budget.Mr. Obama wants $1.9 billion in emergency money, though GOP leaders say he needs far less and that he should be willing to cut elsewhere in the budget to pay for it.

"Jamaican authorities, in response to the mosquito-borne Zika virus, are urging young women to delay becoming pregnant for the next six to 12 months, but their advice is falling on deaf ears.Many Jamaican women of fertility age are ignoring the message, reports the Jamaica Observer, citing Dr. Sandra Knight, chair of the National Family Planning Board (NFPB).""I'm going to be honest with you. I don't think the message has hit home hard yet, because when I listen to the comment of the ladies, they are more like 'Wow, what? An advisory? That sounds extreme.' Those are the comments I am hearing, so I'm not getting the feeling that they are taking it as serious as they ought to and I think they should,"" declared Dr. Knight.""I have not seen an increase in the anxiety of mothers. I'm not saying there isn't, but I really have not seen it. Not even in my private practice do I get the feeling that women are a bit more anxious about having babies, and women who are attending our clinical services, I don't find that they are more anxious,"" the NFPB chair added.The first case of Zika virus was confirmed by the Jamaica Ministry of Health (MOH) last Friday afternoon, but the country has not been added to the list of ""Areas with Zika"" maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).A four-year-old Jamaican child contracted the disease, but has since recovered, reports CTV News. The child traveled to Texas prior to showing symptoms on January 17, adds the report.""Authorities are investigating the case in hopes of determining the source of infection,"" notes the news outlet. Both Texas and Jamaica are home to the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries Zika, among other diseases.Jamaican authorities are reportedly stepping up prevention efforts in the Portmore, St. Catherine area where the child resides.Despite the first Zika case being confirmed, many women of fertility age are ignoring warnings to take precautions against the dangerous disease.Dr. Daryl Daly, an obstetrician-gynecologist (Ob/gyn), is quoted by the Jamaica Observer as saying, ""Heeding the advice of the MOH will not be easy for many women.""The Jamaica Observer sounded the alarm reporting, ""When the virus comes it will be pandemonium and people may then, with the help of public education, understand its full implications.""Jamaica Observer notes:Dr. Daly, the Ob/gyn, pointed out that the reaction to the ministry's advisory varies by socioeconomic status.""The virus is relatively new, and what I find is that the five or six patients with advanced pregnancies who I see in my private practice have been calling me and asking about the Zika virus and what effect it will have on them, but in the public system it seems to me that a lot of the women are approaching it in a laissez-faire manner,"" Dr Daley said.""Today (Friday) I was seeing a patient at the hospital and she said, 'Doctor, I don't care about any CHIKV, ZIKV or 'dickv'.

So it's kind of interesting how the variations in caution are across the different classes,"" he added.The Jamaica Observer visited on clinic in Kingston.""Some pregnant mothers gave mixed reactions to the pending Zika virus and said while they are indeed worried, the most they can do is hope to give birth before the virus comes to the island."" it reports.A few said they are not worried. Meanwhile, ""Others confessed that though fearful, they did not fully understand the problems associated with getting pregnant within the next six to 12 months.""""At a post-Cabinet press briefing at Jamaica House last week, Health Minister Horace Dalley stated that there is a link between ZIKV and microcephaly, which has been observed in more cases of women being infected during the first months of pregnancy,"" notes the Jamaica Observer. ""He further stated that babies who develop the condition in the womb may not live full term, may be born prematurely, may be still born, or may survive but with lifelong disability.""There is no vaccine or preventing drug to combat the virus, according to the CDC, which shows that the Zika virus has spread to 24 countries and territories, including 8 in the Caribbean alone.The 24 countries and territories are: Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Samoa, Suriname, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Venezuela.""Zika virus is spread to people through mosquito bites.

"Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of Zika virus.<U+200B>The Zika virus (ZIKV), is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has spread like wildfire to 30 countries in the Americas. In the USA, Puerto Rico's<U+200B> poor are beginning to succumb to the virus and pregnant women are transmitting the virus to the developing fetus causing a horrible brain defect called microcephaly. Harmful ""pregnancy outcomes include fetal brain abnormalities and microcephaly, a condition characterized by a reduction in head circumference that is often associated with delayed brain development in the fetus"".The American gulf<U+200B> coast is predicted to be ground zero for the virus this summer. Cities such as Houston, New Orleans and Miami are beginning to experience the rainy season with increasing heat (exacerbated by climate change) creating a favorable environment for the Aedes aegypti mosquito to replicate rapidly. Those bitten by an infected mosquito can expect illness with symptoms of fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis.The CDC has warned that Zika is transmitted through several routes, including mosquito bites, sexual contact (heterosexual and homosexual), and blood transfusions.In the case of pregnant women, scientists have discovered how the Zika virus can infect and replicate in immune cells from the placenta, without killing them. Results have been published 5- 27-16 in Cell<U+200B> Host & Microbe.<U+200B>MedicalExpress reports:""Our results substantiate the limited evidence from pathology case reports,"" says senior author Mehul Suthar, PhD, assistant professor of pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine.. ""It was known that the virus was getting into the placenta. But little was known about where the virus was replicating and in what cell type.""Scientists led by Suthar and pediatric infectious disease specialist Rana Chakraborty, MD found that Zika virus could infect placental macrophages, called Hofbauer cells, in cell culture. The virus could also infect another type of placental cell, called cytotrophoblasts, but only after a couple days delay and not as readily. Other researchers recently reported that syncytiotrophoblasts, a more differentiated type of placental cell than cytotrophoblasts, are resistant to Zika infection.The cells for the experiments were derived from full-term placentae, obtained from healthy volunteers who delivered by Cesarean section. The level of viral replication varied markedly from donor to donor, which hints that some women's placentae may be more susceptible to viral infection than others.""Not every pregnant woman who is infected by Zika transmits the virus to her fetus,"" Suthar says. ""Host genetics and non-viral factors, including nutrition and microbiota, as well as timing may be influencing infectivity. A better understanding of these factors could allow the design of preventive measures, and eventually antiviral therapies.""From the study. ( see text for references )The mechanism by which ZIKV crosses the placenta to establish infection in the developing fetus is not well understood. Recent studies have identified ZIKV RNA in amniotic fluid and fetal and newborn brain tissue and ZIKV-specific IgM antibodies have been detected in newborn cerebrospinal fluid<U+200B>. Additionally, ZIKV antigen was found in the chronic villi of a human placenta from a mother who gave birth to an infant with microcephaly, and ZIKV RNA has been isolated from placental tissue of mice infected with ZIKV<U+200B>. Finally, a recent study detected ZIKV antigen in placental tissue from a mother diagnosed with ZIKV disease. In particular, ZIKV antigen was detected in placental macrophages and histiocytes in the intervillous space.Vertical transmission of ZIKV from an infected mother to the developing fetus in utero reflects tropism for placental cells. This organ is a target for a number of viruses by direct and contiguous infection of the cell layers, virion passage through a breach, or cell-associated transport. Examples include rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, HIV-1, hepatitis B and C virus, and parvovirus B19. The placenta is characterized by contact between the maternal blood and fetal chorionic villi. Each villus is lined by trophoblasts, which encase the fetal blood supply and placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells [HCs]). Several studies have confirmed HCs are targets of viral infection in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, syncytiotrophoblasts (differentiated cytotrophoblasts [CTBs]) have been shown to be resistant to infection by a wide range of viruses. A recent study showed that syncytiotrophoblasts also appear to be resistant to infection by phylogenetically related, historic ZIKV strains at early times following infection (24 and 48 hr post-infection [hpi]).It is important to note that, unfortunately, the GOP refuses to act on the funding request that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says they need to research, prevent and control the Zika virus with the hope of discovering antiviral therapies. They just took yet another vacation without acting. Shame on them.The study concludes:These findings stress the importance of developing antiviral therapies directed against ZIKV replication within placental cells as a means to reduce vertical transmission in the mother-infant dyad and the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal abnormalities.xYouTube Video","dailykos","left","16948","zika",808

WHO also reported mounting evidence for the connection between Zika, birth defects, and neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome.The announcements came after a meeting of WHO's emergency committee, which considered evidence from 31 countries experiencing Zika outbreaks.The Associated Press quotes WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan saying, ""reports and investigations in several countries strongly suggest that sexual transmission of the virus is more common than previously assumed.""Over a dozen such cases are currently under investigation in the United States. Another World Health Organization doctor, Bruce Aylward, noted the number of sexual transmissions was still very minor compared to infections from mosquito bites.""The mosquito is undoubtedly still the main driver of transmission,"" Dr. Aylward said.The link between Zika and birth defects such as microcephaly, as well as neurological responses in victims from all age groups, is still considered circumstantial rather than definitively established, but the circumstantial evidence is growing. Nine countries have reported cases of potentially deadly Guillain-Barre syndrome that might be linked to Zika, while microcephaly in newborns has been reported in Brazil, French Polynesia, and possibly Colombia.""Microcephaly is now only one of several documented birth abnormalities associated with Zika infection during pregnancy,"" Dr. Chan warned, while Aylward described the evidence linking the Zika virus to these other disorders was ""really compelling.""A new study from Brazil asserts that Zika is definitely linked to birth defects, and microcephaly may be ""only the tip of the iceberg."" Among the other problems described by the study are calcification of brain tissue, problems with the placenta and amniotic fluid, abnormally small body size, and even stillbirth. Nearly thirty percent of the pregnant women infected with Zika in this study reported some form of abnormality.The World Health Organization reiterated its travel advisory against pregnant women traveling to Zika outbreak regions and advised such women that, if their partners visit such areas, ""they should practice safe sex or abstain from sex for the duration of their pregnancy.""""All of this news is alarming,"" said Dr. Chan.","breitbart","right","16868","zika",366
"Couples returning from areas with the Zika virus should practice safe sex or abstain for eight weeks, instead of just four, to avoid transmitting the disease, the World Health Organization said Tuesday.Zika virus causes birth defects and has been linked to debilitating syndromes. Though it is primarily spread by mosquitoes, there is mounting evidence that sexual transmission ""is possible and more common than previously assumed,"" the WHO said in doubling its recommended abstinence period.The agency said couples planning a pregnancy, while living in or returning from areas affected by Zika, are ""strongly recommended"" to wait at least eight weeks before trying to conceive to make sure the virus has cleared.However, they should wait six months if the male showed symptoms of the virus, because of its ability to persist in semen.WHO said all men who've shown symptoms should practice safe sex or consider abstinence for at least six months and inform their female partners of the situation.A Zika outbreak in Brazil has been linked to a serious uptick in the number of infants born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly, raising concerns about this August's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.The U.S. Olympic Committee plans to offer athletes the right amenities and gear to protect themselves from Zika-carrying mosquitoes, though it will also distribute condoms to ""for use with sexual partners for up to six months following their trip to South America,"" it said in a recent letter to Sen. Barbara Boxer, California Democrat.The Centers for Disease Control has recorded nearly 600 travel-related cases of Zika in the continental U.S., including a handful through sexual transmission.""We did not expect that sexual transmission would be as common as we've seen it,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a recent address to the National Press Club. ""We've had 10 documented cases in the U.S. We've never had sexual transmission of dengue or West Nile, but Zika can spread sexually. That adds a new level of risk and a new message that if your partner is pregnant, and you've been in an area with Zika, use a condom.""So far, 168 pregnant women on the U.S. mainland and 142 in the territories have shown evidence of Zika infection. ","washingtontimes","right","16952","zika",376
"In early May, a rapid, low-cost, freeze-dried, paper-based, strain-specific diagnostic system for detection of the Zika virus was introduced by an international consortium of researchers led by synthetic biologist James Collins of Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. It could soon be used in the field to screen blood, urine or saliva samples.The core of the test kit is a piece of paper that changes color in the presence of Zika virus RNA and produces results in two to three hours, much faster than the PCR test now used, according to Collins, a Wyss Core Faculty member, and Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering & Science and Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT. University of Toronto biochemist Keith Pardee adds that it should cost less than a dollar per test.The team from a number of different institutions came together, and, in a matter of six weeks, developed the new approach to detection and designed a system to deploy in the face of future pandemics. In response to an emerging outbreak, Collins claims, a custom tailored diagnostic system could be ready for use within one week's time. All components of the diagnostic system can be freeze-dried for storage and transport while retaining their efficacy. The ability to pinpoint a strain-specific diagnosis in the field could prove valuable to national and global health organizations for tracking the spread of a viral outbreak in real time and for preparing containment strategies and treatment plans.The work by collaborators from the Wyss Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Broad Institute, Cornell, Arizona State, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Boston University, and Addgene, was described in the May 6 issue of the journal Cell.In this 53-minute podcast, I speak with Collins and Pardee about how a crisis can incite collaboration and innovation.

"Doctors in Brazil say they are shocked by what they perceive as a surge in the number of women raising children with microcephaly alone, after their male partners leave them, blaming the woman for their child's disorder. The number of microcephaly cases in Brazil has increased significantly since the current outbreak of the Zika virus began.""I am surprised by the number of women who are taking care of their baby alone because the father simply decided to abandon the family,"" one pediatrician, who refused to identify herself, told Brazil's Estado de Sao Paulo. Spain's El Mundo notes that, ""while there are no official statistics regarding this, there are many men abandoning pregnant women in Brazil when they learn that their child will be born with microcephaly.""Microcephaly is a disorder in which an infant is born with a skull too small for his or her brain, severely damaging the brain. Brazilian doctors are struggling to understand how a pregnant woman contracting the Zika virus may lead to this deformity in their infant.Adults who contract Zika typically experience mild symptoms of infection, such as conjunctivitis and fever. Eighty percent of patients experience no symptoms at all. A small amount develop a rare nerve disorder, however: Guillain-Barré syndrome, which causes severe muscle pain, paralysis, and death.Angela Rocha, a pediatric infectologist at the Oswaldo Cruz institute in Brazil, tells the Estado that, anecdotally, the cases where she has seen men abandon their children have been those in which the relationship was frayed prior to the Zika diagnosis. ""Typically, men have great difficulty accepting their child's illness,"" she notes, but those who abandon are men ""who had trouble assuming responsibility"" even before knowing of the disease.Carla Silva tells the Estado her husband of nine years left her after her daughter, their third child, was born with microcephaly. ""He blamed me for her birth.  He said the girl was sick because I was a bad person,"" she says. Silva is raising the three children alone now, victim of what El Mundo notes many have begun calling ""male abortion"": when a man does not want his child, he can simply disappear. Silva's husband does not answer phone calls and has blocked her and her family on various messaging applications.Brazilians had already begun to use the phrase ""male abortion"" regarding the widespread practice of abandoning pregnant women should men feel they were unprepared to assume parenting responsibilities. In February 2015, Brazil's National Council of Justice released a report asserting that at least 5.5 million Brazilian children were being raised without a father. ""In Sao Paulo, nearly 700 million children do not have the father's name in the certificate. It is absurd,"" Alvaro Villaça Azevedo, a professor of civil law at the University of Sao Paulo, said at the time.While microcephaly cases may be exacerbating an already prevalent trend, scientists assert they do not yet understand the link between microcephaly and Zika. Brazil has documented more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly suspected of being tied to Zika in the past year. In neighboring Colombia, however, 3,100 pregnant women have been confirmed to carry the virus, but the nation has yet to see a case of microcephaly. Similarly, El Salvador documented 13 healthy births this month by women carrying the Zika virus.Despite the unconfirmed link between the virus and microcephaly, Brazil has recorded a noted increase in the number of illegal abortions in the country. (Abortion is only legal in Brazil if a judge deems it so, for reasons of rape, incest, or threat to the life of the mother.) In many of these cases, expectant mothers may not know whether they are carrying Zika or if their child is at risk for microcephaly but choose not to take the risk. The rise in these abortion cases coincides with a push by the international left, including American advocacy group Planned Parenthood, encouraging Latin American women to abort their children.In cases where a child is born with microcephaly, doctors say there is a possibility of a ""long, healthy, and - why not? - happy"" life. ""It is possible and necessary to have hope.  In the screening, parents are hopeless, no one gives them anything [to be hopeful about]. But, over time, there can be amazing advances,"" one doctor who treats microcephaly patients tells the Estado de Sao Paulo, with the paper noting that experts deem it ""impossible, and even irresponsible, to predict how children with microcephaly will develop, especially in cases derived from the Zika virus.""Ana Carolina Caceres, a Brazilian journalist who has struggled with microcephaly her entire life, said she ""felt attacked and offended"" by the efforts made to encourage women to abort people like her. ""I took it personally,"" she added, noting that she wants to be an example to parents who hope to see their children grow up to live full lives.""My girls wouldn't choose to have microcephaly, but I want to reassure parents their children will be so much stronger than they think,"" said Gwen Hartley, the mother of two daughters with microcephaly. She chose to keep her daughters, despite being told they would not live past age one. They are now 14 and nine years old. ""But they're like any other girls,"" she added. ""They like rap music and watch TV, and they have their own personalities.""","breitbart","right","16839","zika",886
"As Congress prepares for its summer recess, a Republican bill that would provide $1.1 billion in funding to fight the Zika virus continues to be held up by Democrats, largely because it prohibits further taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood and would allow for the application of federally approved pesticides that would kill the mosquitoes that cause the Zika virus.Florida U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney (R) writes in an op-ed at the Palm Beach Post that Democrats are blaming Republicans for the failure of the Zika funding bill in order to advance their radical pro-abortion and environmental agendas.He states:Rooney's comments echo those of Rep. Diane Black (R-TN), a member of the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives. Black explained last year, ""For every one Planned Parenthood facility, there are 20 federally qualified health centers. Planned Parenthood is trying to put a message out there that if they went away, all these women wouldn't have care.""A report on Black's website notes that FQHCs ""provide women with the same preventative services offered by Planned Parenthood, plus the many things they do not offer: mammograms, prenatal care, treatment of diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, depression, etc.""""In states where the state legislature has defunded Planned Parenthood, low-income women are still able to access the same preventative services offered by Planned Parenthood in addition to many others through these FQHCs as well as community health centers,"" the report continues. ""These health care providers far outnumber the number of Planned Parenthood locations, which are primarily located only in urban areas.""Rooney explains the emergency waiver from a redundant Clean Water Act permit that Republicans want states able to have in order to rid areas of the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus:The Zika virus is actually an old problem, one that Brazil successfully fought with the pesticide DDT in the past.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), explained recently that during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil eliminated the mosquito carrying the Zika virus through the use of DDT.Fauci said that Brazil was able to stop the spread of Zika through ""a very aggressive attempt"" to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus and is ""a very difficult mosquito to control and eliminate.""Other experts have urged the government to wipe out the virus completely by lifting a ban on DDT - a pesticide that was wrongly outlawed, they say, by the first head of the EPA - William Ruckelshaus - whose decision went against substantial evidence on DDT's safety and its health benefits in eradicating mosquito-borne diseases.While the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has recently stated the Zika virus causes a serious birth defect known as microcephaly, Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, writes at the Conservative Pundit:""In 1970, the safest and most effective public health weapon in history-DDT-was banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,"" Orient explains. ""In the 1990s, Mexico agreed to abandon its DDT program as a condition of NAFTA. Mosquitoes travel.""""Alarm about Zika will be a public relations exercise, covering the waste of millions of human lives and billions of dollars on ineffective or harmful campaigns, if it does not open a discussion of why diseases on their way out in the 1970s are coming back now,"" she adds.","breitbart","right","16994","zika",567

"BALI, Indonesia -- As the Zika virus continues to cause severe birth deformities in babies whose mothers contract it throughout the Americas, El Salvador has advised women to avoid becoming pregnant for a full two years until the epidemic is eradicated. But women who are already pregnant with the disease are left with few options in a country where abortion is criminalized without exceptions.The virus, which the Aedes aegypti mosquito transmits, is linked to the condition microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and severe developmental delays. Since Brazil confirmed the first case in May 2015, 21 other countries throughout South, Central and North America, including the United States, have since reported occurrences. Nearly 4,000 children have been born with microcephaly in the areas affected. El Savador's government advised women on Monday to delay getting pregnant until 2018 -- an unprecedented recommendation -- while Colombia, Jamaica and Ecuador called for shorter delays. The problem in El Salvador's case is that women who are already pregnant and contract the virus are still subject to the nation's complete ban on abortion, which has already put dozens of women behind bars for murder. Health workers worry the law could drive many desperate women infected with Zika to seek dangerous, back-alley procedures. ""Imagine you're pregnant already, and then you discover you have this virus, and then you discover that this virus causes this condition in the fetus,"" said Anu Kumar, executive vice president of the global abortion rights non-profit IPAS. ""Then you're faced with the decision of, what do you want to do with this?"" Kumar, speaking at the International Conference on Family Planning in Bali, Indonesia, said the Zika situation highlights the public health problems that severely restrictive abortion laws cause. An estimated 47,000 women a year die from unsafe abortion complications.  ""That's exactly why these laws should be liberalized,"" she said, ""because unsafe abortions lead to injury, lead to death, lead to women having unspeakable horror inflicted on them. And why, when we have the technology to do this safely?"" The Center for Reproductive Rights has been lobbying El Salvador's government to change its abortion policy urgently in response to the virus. But a spokesperson for the group said the government has not responded to its petition, nor has it made an effort to increase family planning services to the couples who are being told to avoid pregnancy. ""The government is washing their hands of responsibility,"" said Paula Avila-Guillen, the organization's programs specialist for Latin America. ""These recommendations are really empty words. They aren't going hand in hand with policies to make contraception and emergency contraception available, especially in El Salvador where those things are very inaccessible."" Reproductive rights advocates hope the desperate situation caused by the ZIka epidemic gives El Salvador and other heavily Catholic Latin American countries the impetus to reevaluate their family planning and abortion policies. ""This is an opportunity the government has to change its law and stop this discrimination against women,"" Avila-Guillen said. This story was supported by funding from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.   Also on HuffPost    ","huffingtonpost","left","16826","zika",586
"The parents of babies born with microcephaly caused by the Zika virus are likely facing a lifetime of challenge and commitment.It's quite possible they will end up taking care of their brain-damaged son or daughter for the rest of their lives.In many instances, that adult child may not walk or even talk.""It could become a very complicated life for those parents,"" Dr. Stephen J. Lauer, associate professor and associate chair of pediatrics at the University of Kansas Medical Center, told Healthline. ""It could be a real burden for those families.""That sober reality is now in the spotlight at a New Jersey hospital.Officials at Hackensack University Medical Center confirmed today that a child born there has Zika-linked microcephaly.They said the 31-year-old mother contracted the virus while in Honduras and was admitted to the New Jersey medical center on Friday while visiting the United States.Microcephaly isn't all that rare.There are an estimated 25,000 cases a year in the United States alone. They are caused by a number of factors.Many of these children are born with small heads but have little or no brain damage.However, Lauer pointed out, the severe microcephaly induced by the Zika virus is a far more serious situation.Scientists have determined that the Zika virus attacks a certain type of developing brain cells. That's why it only brings on mild flu-like symptoms in adults and children but causes devastating effects on fetuses whose brains are forming.Lauer explained that in most microcephaly cases the small head is a symptom of the disease and doesn't indicate whether there is any brain damage.In Zika-induced microcephaly, however, the small head occurs because the brain isn't fully developed.The future of the so-called ""Zika babies"" is still an unknown.After all, there are only babies to study right now -- no adults or even older children have the disease.However, Lauer said, the indications are not promising.He said the damage caused in vitro by the Zika virus has stopped or severely curtailed the cognitive development of these infants.He said it's likely the brain-damaged babies will not sit up when normal infants do. They probably won't crawl, walk, or talk when most children do either.Many may be confined to wheelchairs and need to be fed and dressed, even into adulthood.""It's possible their cognitive development will never catch up,"" Lauer said. ""There are a lot of very serious concerns here.""He added children with this condition will require a lot of therapy over the years. They also will probably be more ""medically fragile.""""These type of kids can get very sick,"" he said.Lauer noted the parental burden would be rough in the United States, even with all its medical services.In Brazil, especially in rural areas where health services are limited, the toll on parents could be even tougher.The seriousness of Zika-induced microcephaly prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to change its recommendations this week regarding the virus.WHO officials said they are now encouraging people returning from areas where the Zika virus is prevalent to practice safe sex or abstain from sex for eight weeks.Lauer said even that precaution may not be enough.Scientists are pretty certain how long Zika stays in a person's bloodstream, but Lauer said they still don't know how long it remains in human semen.In addition, a pregnant woman could be infected with the virus but not exhibit any symptoms.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports there are 591 confirmed cases of Zika infection in the United States.All of those are people who traveled abroad.So far, the only case that has resulted in Zika-induced microcephaly is the one reported at the New Jersey hospital today.In Brazil, the number of confirmed and suspected cases of microcephaly since October has now topped 5,000.You can read the original article on Healthline.com.","huffingtonpost","left","16952","zika",680
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Scientists in Brazil have uncovered a new brain disorder associated with Zika infections in adults: an autoimmune syndrome called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or ADEM, that attacks the brain and spinal cord.Zika has already been linked with the autoimmune disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome, which attacks peripheral nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, causing temporary paralysis that can in some cases require patients to rely on respirators for breathing.The new discovery now shows Zika may provoke an immune attack on the central nervous system as well.The findings add to the growing list of neurological damage associated with Zika.According to the World Health Organization, there is a strong scientific consensus that, in addition to Guillain-Barre, Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly, though conclusive proof may take months or years. Microcephaly is defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems.Brazil said it has confirmed more than 940 cases to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating nearly 4,300 additional suspected cases of microcephaly.In addition to autoimmune disease, some researchers also have reported patients with Zika infections developing encephalitis and myelitis - nerve disorders typically caused by direct infections in nerve cells.""Though our study is small, it may provide evidence that in this case, the virus has different effects on the brain than those identified in current studies,"" Dr. Maria Lucia Brito, a neurologist at Restoration Hospital in Recife, Brazil, said in a statement.ADEM typically occurs in the aftermath of an infection, causing intense swelling in the brain and spinal cord that damages myelin, the white protective coating surrounding nerve fibers. It results in weakness, numbness and loss of balance and vision, symptoms similar to multiple sclerosis.Brito presented her findings on Sunday at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in Vancouver. The study involved 151 patients who visited her hospital between December 2014 and June 2015. All had been infected with arboviruses, the family of viruses that includes Zika, dengue and chikungunya.Six of these patients developed symptoms consistent with autoimmune disorders. Of these six, four had Guillain-Barre and two had ADEM. In both ADEM cases, brain scans showed damage to white matter. ADEM symptoms typically last about six months.All six patients tested positive for Zika, and all had lingering effects after being discharged from the hospital, with five patients reporting motor dysfunction, one with vision problems, and one with cognitive decline.At least 13 countries have reported cases of Guillain-Barre linked with outbreaks of Zika, according to the World Health Organization, and WHO believes that Zika likely is the cause.Dr. James Sejvar, a neuroepidemiologist for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the ADEM cases linked with Zika do not appear to be occurring at the same accelerated rate as cases of Guillain-Barre, but said doctors should be on the lookout for ADEM and other central nervous system illnesses.""Of course, the remaining question is 'Why?'"" Sejvar said. ""Why does Zika virus appear to have the strong association with GBS and potential other immune/inflammatory diseases of the nervous system?""Sejvar, who has studied Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) in Brazil and is involved in a major clinical trial of Guillain-Barre in Puerto Rico, said he hopes future studies will shed more light on such questions.","huffingtonpost","left","16902","zika",576
"The World Health Organization said Thursday it will convene an emergency session to fight the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease that is ""spreading explosively"" in the Americas and has been tied to birth defects and other serious health problems, although the link is murky.The situation is particularly urgent, the U.N. agency's chief said, because there are no vaccines, treatments or rapid diagnostic tests for the little-known virus, which is hitting Brazil particularly hard before the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro this August.""The level of alarm is extremely high,"" said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, who scheduled an emergency Monday session in Geneva, Switzerland, to address the surge in infections.Zika virus typically causes mild symptoms, such as fever or rash. But now it has been linked to the birth of babies with abnormally small heads - a condition known as microcephaly - and Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves.Much more research is needed to determine if Zika is causing either condition, even if the data are ""very suggestive"" of a link, said Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Health Security.That's because researchers must determine if additional factors - nutrition or prenatal issues, for instance, or other infections - are playing a role.Underscoring the confusion, Brazil's health ministry this week was able to confirm only 270 cases of microcephaly out of 4,180 suspected cases, according to multiple news reports. It ruled out 462 and is still studying the rest.Zika isn't being transmitted in the continental U.S., but it has been found in returning travelers and is spreading in Puerto Rico, prompting President Obama this week to convene a special meeting with his top health and national security officials.""Our real concern is about this correlation between the Zika virus and a particular birth defect, and that's what we're mindful of, and that's why we're mobilizing the kind of response that we believe is consistent with the threat that's out there,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at Thursday's daily briefing.Members of Congress also got into the act, urging the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health to step up the fight against the disease through research.""With the World Health Organization's recent announcement of the virus 'spreading explosively' and recently reported cases in the United States, it is imperative we take preventative measures to ensure the safety of all Americans,"" Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the Maryland Democrat who is running for an open Senate seat, said in a letter to both agencies.The CDC says pregnant women should postpone travel to nations where Zika transmission is present. If they must travel, they should use insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants and follow other tips to avoid mosquito bites, it said.Several airlines are offering a refund or free rebooking to pregnant women who bought tickets to Zika-affected nations, although some require a doctor's note.The Zika virus was discovered in Uganda in 1947 and had been relatively dormant for decades, mainly affecting monkeys, before it hit the Pacific Islands in 2007, according to the WHO.""The situation today is dramatically different,"" Dr. Chan said. ""Last year the virus was detected in the Americas, where it is now spreading explosively.""Since Brazil reported a case in May 2015, infections have spread to 23 countries and territories in the region. Making matters worse, this year's El Nino weather pattern is expected to allow mosquito populations to proliferate.On Twitter Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said the world needs to declare ""war"" against the Aedes mosquito, which carries Zika virus.The White House said the risk of mosquito-borne illness in the U.S. is relatively low at the moment given January's cool temperatures.""But obviously, that's going to change,"" Mr. Earnest added. ""Eventually, the mercury is going to start to rise, and we need to be mindful of any sort of potential risk here in the United States.""In the meantime, the virus is emerging as the next global health crisis after Ebola killed more than 11,000 in West Africa during a two-year epidemic that ended earlier this month, though flare-ups are still possible.The WHO had been criticized for its slow response to that epidemic. And while the diseases are quite different, the Ebola outbreak ""did concretize the fact that infectious disease emergencies can cause a lot of panic and societal disruption,"" Dr. Adalja noted.That said, there is a wealth of knowledge about the mosquitoes that spread Zika and other diseases, including yellow fever, dengue and the chikungunya virus.""These mosquitoes have been a public health target for quite a while,"" Dr. Adalja said, ""and a lot of knowledge exists on how to diminish their population."" ","washingtontimes","right","16828","zika",799
"Zika virus is the cause of microcephaly and other fetal brain defects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Wednesday.While there isn't yet ""conclusive proof"" that the mosquito-borne virus causes severe birth defects, health officials asserted that the totality of the research thus far clearly shows that there is a causal connection, and that there is good reason for pregnant women and their partners to protect themselves against mosquitoes in regions where Zika virus is spreading locally.""We've now confirmed what mounting evidence has suggested, affirming our early guidance to pregnant women and their partners to take steps to avoid Zika infection and to health care professionals who are talking to patients every day,"" said CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden in a statement. ""We are working to do everything possible to protect the American public.""  The CDC joins scientists from around the world who are also convinced the virus is a cause of microcephaly, as well as the rare neurological disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome. The World Health Organization released a statement about this global scientific consensus back in March, and CDC published their review of the scientific evidence linking Zika virus and microcephaly on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.This causal relationship means that women who contract Zika virus while pregnant have an increased risk of giving birth to a baby with microcephaly and other brain defects. But it doesn't mean that it will happen to all women who get Zika virus while pregnant.More research is needed to establish the relative and absolute risk of having a baby with a birth defect, the CDC's researchers write in their study review. Scientists also need to know the range of defects caused by a prenatal Zika virus infection, as well as explore any other factors that could influence birth defect risk. The CDC will continue to recommend that pregnant women in the U.S. avoid travel in areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. They also recommend that men with pregnant partners either abstain from sex or use a condom always after traveling to a region with Zika virus, as the disease can be transmitted sexually and potentially harm a growing fetus.  For couples living in an area with active Zika transmission, the CDC added a recommendation to seek help from health care providers to carefully plan pregnancies and avoid the risks associated with the virus.Zika virus is spread primarily by the mosquito species Aedes aegypti. The biggest outbreak of the disease is centered in Brazil, where about 7,000 babies with reported microcephaly have been born since 2015. Health officials there have investigated and confirmed that 1,113 babies do indeed have microcephaly or other defects, while so far confirming that 2,066 do not. The rest remain under investigation. The disease is currently spreading locally in 42 countries or territories around the world, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., there are 346 cases of Zika acquired during travel, but zero cases of the virus contracted through a local mosquito bite.However, U.S. health officials are gearing up for the upcoming mosquito season by warning Americans in high-risk areas like southern Florida and southern Texas to use repellant and wear long-sleeved clothes. In January, CDC officials said a small Zika virus outbreak in the U.S. was ""likely.""","huffingtonpost","left","16904","zika",573

It is time we reform our broken criminal justice system. First, we need to reform policing practices, end racial profiling, and eradicate racial disparities in sentencing. Second, we need to promote alternatives to incarceration, particularly for nonviolent and first-time offenders, so families aren't broken up. We need to improve access to high-quality treatment for substance abuse, inside and outside the prison system, because drug and alcohol addiction is a disease, not a crime - and we need to treat it as such.And third, we need to be deliberate about understanding the different paths that can land women in prison, be more attentive to women's unique needs while they are incarcerated, and do more to support women and their families once they are released. I will institute gender-responsive policies in the federal prison system and encourage states to do the same-because women follow different paths to crime than men, and face different risks and challenges both inside and outside the prison walls, and every part of the justice system, from sentencing to the conditions of confinement to re-entry services, should reflect women's unique needs.Research shows that women's relationships, like Tanya's friendship with the man from the basketball court, are often a significant risk factor for becoming involved with the justice system. Most women in prison are there because of nonviolent drug or property crimes. Over 60% of them report drug dependence or abuse in the year before they went to prison. Many of them grew up in abusive households, like Alice, and they are more likely than men in prison to have experienced sexual abuse or trauma in their life before prison.And too often, a woman and her children continue to live with the consequences even after she has served her time and paid her debt to society. Because formerly incarcerated people face limited job opportunities, an entire family is effectively punished by a woman's time in prison.","dailykos","left","16919","zika",389

"As Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, continues to dominate the headlines, world leaders and health organizations warned the public about the virus' spread and offered up resources to fight the disease, which is likely linked to a wave of birth defects in Brazil over the past few months. With the high volume of news about the Zika virus -- check out our full coverage here -- it's tough to stay up-to-date on the most recent developments. Here's the latest information you should know:Four million people could be infected with the virus by the end of 2016, The New York Times reports. Still, experts described the risk of Zika transmission in the United States as very low, because U.S. cities are less crowded than cities in South and Central America, and because the use of window screens and air conditioners in the U.S. is widespread.Areas that are hospitable to mosquitos carrying other tropical diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya, are more likely to be affected by the Zika virus, such as the Gulf Coast of Florida and the southern tip of Texas.The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is the primary carrier of the Zika virus, dengue fever and chikungunya, was nearly eradicated in the 1970s, but a combination of budget cuts, insecticide concerns and a yellow fever vaccine led to a decrease in mosquito-elimination programs, according to The Associated Press. Today the aggressive insect is thriving in Latin America and the Caribbean. Hospitals in Brazil are overwhelmed by the exponential increase in babies born with microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born with underdeveloped brains and small heads.

"The Brazilian government announced that it is considering imposing fines on private landowners who do not allow public health officials on their property to eliminate breeding sites of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito that transmits the Zika virus, according to various news reports.On February 1, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff signed a decree allowing health officials to enter abandoned public and private buildings, by force if necessary, to eradicate mosquito breeding sites, even without authorization from the landowners, reports El Universal.Under the decree, in cases when access to property proves ""essential for disease containment,"" health officials can request the assistance of police authority if the landowner denies them entry.On Monday, Jacques Wagner, a member of the Rousseff administration, told reporters hat the government was considering imposing fines on landowners who deny entrance to health authorities, adding that it would also apply to repeat offenders who continue to keep Aedes aegypti breeding sites on their property, reports Capital Teresina.""It is a fine for irresponsibility in maintaining your property,"" declared Wagner.There is a possibility that the fine would also apply to owners of vacant lots and closed residences, indicated Helder Barbalho, a member of the Rousseff administration.The measure was discussed at a meeting Monday between the Brazilian president and nine ministers.Xinhua Español reports that the proposal came after Brazil deployed more than 220,000 Brazilian troops and 272,000 public health workers to visit nearly 3 million homes in 270 municipalities across the country, in search of possible Aedes Aegypti mosquito breeding grounds, as part of a national campaign against Zika.Of all the properties visited, 295,000 were closed and 15,000 landowners refused entry to health workers, reveals the report.The Brazilian attorney general's office has been charged with weighing whether implementing a fine would constitute an illegal invasion of property since the residences are private lands protected by law.El Universal reports that the legal basis for any fine would be that a person is contributing to the spread of the Zika virus by not allowing health officials to combat the disease.Wagner reportedly indicated that the Rousseff administration is arguing that the fine is necessary because the country is in the midst of Zika virus health emergency. Brazil is the country most affected by Zika with an estimated 1.5 million Brazilians having contracted the virus.At the beginning of this month, the Brazilian government implemented provisional measure that ""allows the forced entry of health workers in abandoned public and private buildings to combat Aedes aegypti, which transmits dengue, chikungunya fever and the Zika virus,"" reports Capital Teresina.In the absence of a vaccine or preventive drug to combat the booming virus, Brazil launched the ""Zero Zika"" campaign, which involves the deployment of tens of thousands of soldiers to millions of homes and businesses across the country to eliminate Aedes Aegypti breeding grounds.Between Monday and Thursday, at least 55,000 Brazilian troops will combat the Aedes aegypti in 270 cities across the country, the government announced.In March, the government will focus on raising awareness of the Zika virus in private and private schools as well as universities, notes Capital Teresina. The Zika virus has been linked to microcephaly, a neurological disorder that causes abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains in newborns. It has also been associated to Guillain-Barré, a rare syndrome that causes the immune system to attack nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis.","breitbart","right","16848","zika",562
"Thirty-five cases of the Zika Virus have been reported in Texas but the virus is expected to spread in the Lone Star State during mosquito season. The threat is especially likely near the Texas-Mexico border and along the Gulf Coast.The cases that have been reported thus far have included thirty-four individuals who traveled to Zika-infected countries, including one of them who was pregnant. One of these had sex with someone who had contacted the Zika virus when they were traveling out of the country. Central America, as reported by Breitbart Texas, has been especially hard hit.Mosquito season is upon us and members of the Texas Senate Committee held an expedited hearing and heard from the experts in the state. One of them, Department of State Health Services Commissioner John Hellerstedt, told the Texas state senators, ""We do believe that Texas will, at some point, likely experience mosquito vector transmission."" As the CBS affiliate in Dallas reported, the commissioner added, ""We don't know when and we don't really know at what level that will occur."" He said that cases have been reported to have been transmitted in Mexico but not on the U.S.-Mexico border.""One of the big advantages that we have over other parts of the world in terms of Zika is our ability to see it coming and prepare for it,"" he was reported to have said during the hearing.As reported by Breitbart Texas in February, Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed an infectious disease task force to prepare for the Zika virus in the Lone Star state. He appointed thirty-one members to the Task Force on Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response. Dr. John Hellerstedt serves as the director.The state senate committee heard from ""some of the best minds at the state and local levels on the Zika response,"" said Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.In a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas, Patrick said that Texas is examining mosquito protection measures, including ways to help eliminate mosquito habitats in homes, and using necessary testing as appropriate.Invited testimony included experts from the following institutes:Another member of Governor Abbott's task force, Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D., is Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. He was reported by CBSDFW to say he was never worried about an Ebola outbreak in the state; however, he is concerned about a Zika virus outbreak in Texas.

"Paul Ryan's and Mitch McConnell's Congress is getting ready for the longest August recess in something like 60 years, one that's going to swallow up half of July and the first week of September. What are the Republicans doing with this very short week? Playing politics, what else? That includes  refusing to work with Democrats to come up with a responsible Zika prevention bill. Meanwhile,Public health experts have warned that the mosquitoes carrying Zika will populate over the summer and exacerbate the spread of the virus, which can cause birth defects.Republicans continue to insist on funding that prevents money from going to birth control by blocking Planned Parenthood from getting any of the funds and on weakening Clean Water Act regulations with suspended pesticide rules. Oh, and underfunding it by stealing money from other public health programs. Like Ebola. You know, the thing they were so terrified by during the last election and which also could run out of funding by October since the government has been forced to borrow from it to pay for Zika while waiting for Congress to provide the money.The party that also has so much respect for ""life"" is also not going to do a damned thing about gun violence. Not even after a month of horrors, because Paul Ryan's ""hands have been tied by conservatives, including the House Freedom Caucus, whose opposition to an anti-terrorism package with modest gun provisions derailed the bill last week."" Those would be the ""modest"" gun provisions approved by the NRA. But Ryan is going to take the time to have an abortion fight this week, blocking a state-California-from requiring all health policies to include abortion coverage. Because state's rights only extends so far.What else?

Democrats are united behind blocking these bills because McConnell refuses to agree to keep poison pills-like defunding Planned Parenthood-out of them.This means another last minute spending fight to keep government open when they return for the short September work period.

"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have confirmed that six infants have been born in U.S. states with birth defects following their mother's infection with the Zika virus. 234 women in the continental United States have tested positive for Zika.In addition to those cases in the continental U.S., the CDC says it has identified 189 cases of Zika virus among pregnant women in U.S. territories, most in Puerto Rico.CDC officials released the number Thursday, though with little more information necessary to understand the danger Zika poses to American women who are or may become pregnant. For example, they did not mention how many of those six born with birth defects were diagnosed with microcephaly - a condition in which an infant's skull is too small for his or her brain, crushing the brain - or other Zika-related conditions. They also did not note how many of those pregnant women had given birth already, leaving many to wonder what percentage of those infants born to mothers with Zika those six cases represent.Of these six cases, three either miscarried or aborted.""We can't provide a lot of information about where these women are in their pregnancy. We don't want to inadvertently disclose information about difficult decisions these women are making about their pregnancies,"" CDC representative Dr. Denise J. Jamieson told the New York Times. Some women who are told they are carrying the Zika virus may choose to abort their children, leaving the outcome of that affected pregnancy a mystery.The CDC did note that a number of the cases in which a child was born with microcephaly to a mother carrying the Zika virus occurred despite the mother not having any Zika symptoms.The Zika virus poses a largely unknown threat in populations in which it circulates widely. In most adults - 80 percent - the virus is completely asymptomatic. In those who suffer Zika symptoms, they may record rashes, mild fevers, conjunctivitis, and mild muscle aching.In a minority of adults, Zika has been linked to the development of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a condition which causes extreme muscle pain, paralysis, and death. GBS is treatable, though many have died in Latin America, particularly Venezuela, due to a lack of access to proper medical treatment.The greatest threat the strain of Zika currently prevalent in Latin America has posed to people has been to the unborn. Scientists have confirmed that Zika can cause microcephaly in infants, as well as a host of other abnormalities, including diminished sight and hearing, among others. Tracking whether a pregnant woman is exposing their child to Zika is difficult, as many women do not exhibit any symptoms of carrying the virus.Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC, has warned that the number of Zika cases in the northern hemisphere are expected to skyrocket as summer arrives. Zika is carried by the aedes aegypti mosquito, which requires hot and humid climates to survive. Frieden predicted on Thursday that ""dozens or hundreds of infants"" may be born with microcephaly in Puerto Rico as its climate is especially appealing to mosquitos. Puerto Rico has already recorded 1,700 cases of Zika infection this year.Experts are warning that Zika may become a global threat following the Summer Olympics, expected to take place this August in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Brazil has registered over 3,000 microcephaly cases and is considered the epicenter of the current Zika epidemic. ""An unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic,"" a letter signed by over 150 medical experts warned. The letter, released in May, demanded the Olympics be postponed or relocated to a lower-risk region, lest tourists spread the virus globally.Olympic officials have denied that Zika is a threat and asserted that the games will take places as planned. The International Olympic Commission is basing its decision on the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation. ""The Committee concluded that there is a very low risk of further international spread of Zika virus as a result of the Olympic and Paralympic Games as Brazil will be hosting the Games during the Brazilian winter,"" the WHO said of the decision this week.","breitbart","right","16969","zika",703
"Sprinter Usain Bolt may not be adding his voice to the growing chorus of athletes and activists expressing concern over the health conditions in Rio de Janeiro as the Summer Olympics inch closer.While a medley of potential crises hover over August's Games, Zika virus -- the mosquito-borne disease known to cause, among other side effects, serious fetal brain defects -- has led athletes from around the globe to become increasingly wary of traveling to Brazil.Their worries are more than understandable. Reuters reported last month that the nation had ""registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2,"" with Rio's region coming in with the most likely cases at 35,505. Moreover, that same report claims there have been 4,908 suspected or confirmed cases nationwide of microcephaly -- one of the Zika-linked birth defects, wherein a baby's head and brain are much smaller than normal.All that is why some have cringed at the nonchalant remark Bolt made during an interview with NBC's Peter Alexander, which aired Wednesday on the ""Today"" show.Asked if he ""worri[es] about Zika"" heading into Rio 2016, Bolt began on steady, safe ground -- ""Hopefully, by the time I get there, they'll have it under control. I'm sure they'll put things in place to sort it out. So I'm not really stressed right now"" -- before some nudging on Alexander's part sparked the more flippant response from the runner.Alexander: ""Your mates on your team tell me that the mosquitoes usually stay away from you. What up with that -- why are the mosquitoes intimidated by Usain Bolt?""Bolt: ""Because I'm fast. They can't catch me.""According to Complex, Bolt runs at a speed close to 28 miles per hour, while a mosquito flies just over one mile per hour. So while he was, technically, correct, the response drew criticism online, as people became upset at the glib take on an anything-but-comic health crisis.Usain Bolt's comments on Zika on NBC's Today Show hard to believe. Clearly meant as joke - but what a stupid, irresponsible thing to say.Bolt undoubtedly meant no offense -- and if he had had the time to think it over, he likely would've never uttered the joke at all. Let's all just hope that not only Bolt but everyone else traveling to and living in Brazil this summer is also able to evade the virus. During a two-week event predicated on international cohesion, one of the last things we need is continual concern over increasing contagion.","huffingtonpost","left","16939","zika",434

"Scientists around the world are frustrated over Brazil's refusal to share data on the country's current Zika outbreak, a policy some say is hindering worldwide collaboration efforts to fight the virus. At the center of the controversy are new policies in Brazil -- signed into law but not yet implemented -- that technically make it illegal for Brazilian researchers to send genetic samples abroad.The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   With the high volume of news about the Zika virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps. Here's the latest information you should know: A man in Campinas, Brazil, who was treated for gunshot wounds became ill with Zika virus after multiple blood transfusions in April 2015, Reuters reports. The patient died of his wounds, not of Zika, but the incident prompted health officials to reinforce the mandate that potential donors refrain from donating blood for 30 days after recovering from a Zika infection.The U.S. Red Cross issued a similar edict, asking donors to delay their donations for 28 days if they have visited a Zika outbreak zone, and to contact the organization if they develop Zika-like symptoms after donating blood.Brazil's president signed news law last year that regulate how researchers use genetic material, but the framework of these laws has yet to be established. The result: scientists are effectively hamstrung and legally prevented from sharing Zika data with the rest of the world.As a result, foreign scientists are forced to study samples from pervious Zika outbreaks, such as the 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia, or to rely on voluntary samples from wealthy Brazilian citizens who want a diagnosis. Researchers around the world are frustrated, and for the most part, helpless. ""If countries don't share, the only repercussions they face are public condemnation,"" Lawrence Gostin, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights at Georgetown University, told the Associated Press.Mexico's health ministry emphasized that the country's Zika outbreaks are far away from the tourism hubs, but acknowledged that the disease will inevitably spread. At last count, the country had 34 confirmed Zika cases, up from 18 a week prior, and is currently on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's watch list of countries with local transmissions. So far, there haven't been any cases of Zika virus in a pregnant woman in Mexico.The CDC currently recommends that pregnant women avoid traveling to countries or territories with ongoing Zika transmissions. United, Delta, Lufthansa and Air France offered employees who are or want to become pregnant the chance for reassignment to areas that haven't been affected by Zika virus.""A small number of crew members have swapped trips to date,"" Morgan Durrant, a Delta spokesman, told Reuters.A health workers union that planned to strike for better working conditions called off their efforts so they could continue helping Brazilians in the face of the country's ongoing Zika outbreak, according to the Associated Press. The union members are among the individuals who have been going door-to-door in Brazil eradicating the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries the Zika virus.","huffingtonpost","left","16835","zika",717
"One nonprofit is making sure some of the most vulnerable members of the community are protected from the Zika virus.On Monday, Metropolitan Ministries in Tampa, Florida began giving out about 150 Zika-prevention kits to homeless individuals, according to Fox News. The kits will help protect homeless families from the mosquito-borne virus by providing them with a net, bug spray, and tablets to put in standing water, reports WFLA.""Hundreds of homeless families across Tampa Bay are living in their cars, tents and in the woods in this extreme summer heat,"" a Metropolitan Ministries blog states. ""The Zika virus is a new threat to the area. For little children, and expectant mothers, these conditions are dangerous.

In February, the governor declared Zika a health emergency in several counties, including Tampa's Hillsborough County. People living in poverty are particularly vulnerable to Zika, according to the Washington Post, as many live without air conditioning or proper window screens. For those who are homeless and living outdoors, the situation is exacerbated: ""I've been in Florida for 10 years and every year I run into a family sleeping in a park, or in the woods,"" Metropolitan Ministries President Tim Marks told WFLA. ""They've all complained about bug bites, and now with Zika, the risk is even higher.""Help us combat the Zika virus.

"The Health Ministry of Brazil has requested that American virologists travel to Zika-affected areas and hold high-level meetings with their medical experts, as they collaborate to find a vaccine to prevent the disease from spreading further.Brazilian Health Minister Marcelo Castro is scheduled to speak with American Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell on Wednesday to propose that the United States send disease control experts to Brazil to cooperate with local medical authorities. Among the topics of discussion will be controlling the mosquito population in Brazil, researching how the virus spreads (particularly to unborn children), and developing a Zika vaccine.The Zika virus is spread through bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which makes its home in all countries of the Western Hemisphere except Chile and Canada. As Brazil is currently in the middle of its summer season, it has become the epicenter of what the National Institutes of Health have deemed a Zika ""pandemic.""Brazilian newspaper O Globo notes that Brazilian and American scholars have already been collaborating on a similar project: a Dengue vaccine. Like Zika, Dengue - along with Chikungunya virus and Yellow Fever - are transmitted through Aedes aegypti bites. ""The idea is to take advantage of an existing partnership between the Butantan Institute and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) studying a vaccine against dengue,"" O Globo reports, adding that at least one Brazilian researcher, Pedro Vasconcelos, met Tuesday with virologists to discuss the response to Zika.Reuters notes that Castro also announced that American technical experts will be landing in Brazil on February 11 ""to hold a high level meeting where they will determine the first steps and timetable for developing this vaccine.""""I bring a word of hope, strength, force. We, Brazilian society, we are able to overcome this mosquito,"" Castro said in remarks Tuesday. His statement varied dramatically in tone from comments made last week, in which he declared Brazil was ""badly losing the battle against the mosquito."" World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman Christian Lindmeier described his attitude as ""fatalistic,"" though the WHO subsequently declared Zika a public health emergency.American medical experts have already made a major contribution to the understanding of Zika: on Tuesday, doctors in Texas confirmed the first known case of a person contracting Zika through sexual contact. The patient in question had not traveled to a Zika-infected area, but had had sexual contact with a person who had recently traveled to Venezuela and had tested positive for Zika. Experts note that medical literature has catalogued only one known case of the presence of Zika in human semen.Venezuela has become a problem spot for the fight against Zika in Latin America due to the government's lack of transparency in documenting cases. While Brazil and Colombia have enhanced efforts to keep track of Zika cases, Venezuelan health officials have not made public their data set on Zika. Colombian Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria has condemned Venezuela for having ""no systematic reporting of the data,"" calling it a ""serious problem."" Venezuela claims to have documented only 4,700 Zika cases, while neighboring Colombia has catalogued over 20,000.Brazil has already reached out to experts from Africa, where researchers have spent the past two years rapidly developing technology to combat the deadly Ebola virus. A team of six researchers from Senegal are currently working in Recife, a town where an estimated 100,000 people have been exposed to Zika. The group is working to modify a portable, 15-minute Ebola test to diagnose Zika, instead. ""Ebola taught us that it is possible to detect the beginning of an epidemic, but not to foresee its end,"" Dr. Amadou Alpha Sall, the head of the team, said.American experts have a vested interest in developing a rapid solution to the blossoming Zika pandemic. Most scientific evidence indicates the virus will find its way to the United States as early as April, when the weather in the southern parts of the country becomes significantly more hot and humid. The Pan-American Health Organization, a regional wing of the WHO, has predicted Zika will surface in every nation of the Americas save the two without significant Aedes populations.""We need to really be on the lookout.  That involves having really good information systems from the CDC. It means training doctors. The last thing we want is a repeat of Ebola, where we saw preventable deaths in the United States and globally,"" Lawrence Gostin, director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, told USA Today. Gostin is the co-author of a paper in which he predicts that Zika has ""explosive pandemic potential"" and urgent action is required to prevent major devastation in the region.","breitbart","right","16834","zika",782
"WASHINGTON -- Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives on Friday tried to jumpstart the stalled emergency funding process to address the threat of Zika virus, and warned House Republicans that they will attempt to force a hearing on the matter.With warm weather and mosquito season imminent, little progress has been made in passing the funding health experts seek to combat the bug-borne menace, which officials warned this week is more dire than previously thought.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) recently declared that his committee was working on the drafting the legislation. But he has also complained that the White House hasn't provided significant information about what it wants to do with the money.From Democrats' perspective, however, the White House has amply explained why it needs $1.9 billion as soon as possible to try to mitigate the Zika threat. Three of them sent Rogers a letter on Friday, noting that committee rules say the chairman has seven business days to call a special meeting if three members demand one, and that the majority of the committee can hold its own if the chairman refuses. They want a meeting on Zika, which they said would allow the administration to explain the requirements.""It is imperative that the Appropriations Committee move quickly on this potential public health catastrophe and that we provide both short- and long-term resources, to properly prepare our public health system,"" wrote Reps. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.).It is unlikely that any Republicans would help them reach the majority needed for a special meeting, and Rogers said in a statement that there was no need for more hearings. What is needed, he said, is more cooperation. ""This isn't about politics or optics or finger pointing. This is about a very real crisis that needs our genuine attention,"" Rogers said. ""As I've said many times, including directly to the President, we want to be partners in the fight to stop this terrible disease before it spreads even further.""Part of the problem is that Republicans don't feel as if the White House has adequately explained what the needs are, how much must be spent right away, what funding is required for longer-term needs and how the spending would be accounted for.The White House announced this week that it was transferring nearly $600 million from the emergency fund Congress passed to combat Ebola, but it still insists the rest of its request needs to be met.The committee aide said rough estimates -- which are rough because the administration hasn't answered the committee's questions -- indicate the White House has about $2 billion available to deal with immediate needs.""The information we are seeking doesn't require hearings, it requires thorough, detailed budget documentation that can be the basis for the responsible spending of taxpayer dollars,"" Rogers said.""Every day counts in the fight against Zika, and so does every penny we spend,"" he added. ""We must ensure that we are using every dollar the right way and at the right time, to save lives and to prevent Zika from becoming an epidemic within our borders.""If the immediate need does look worse after the administration answers the committee's questions, the aide said Rogers would be open to more emergency spending, although the committee chair seemed to favor including new Zika funding in the budget appropriations for next year, which are starting now.Congress did pass a measure this week to spur research on a vaccine -- an accomplishment the White House called ""meager.""""It's akin to passing out umbrellas in the advance of a potential hurricane,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday.  ""An umbrella might come in handy, but it's going to be insufficient to ensure that communities all across the country are protected from a potentially significant impact.""What Congress has done is ""not going to do anything to help local communities across the country ... fight the mosquitoes that carry this virus. It's not going to expand access to diagnostics that would allow people to more easily get tested and get a prompt result from that test about whether or not they have the Zika virus,"" Earnest said. ""All of these are steps that are critical to ensuring that we're protecting pregnant women and their newborn children from a virus that we know has a potentially devastating impact.""","huffingtonpost","left","16906","zika",757
"Pointing up growing fears over the spread of the Zika virus, both the U.S. Congress and the United Nations mobilized Monday on ways to step up the fight against the disease.In Washington, lawmakers pressed the Obama administration Monday if it was doing enough to understand and combat the virus, a mosquito-borne agent that is coming into the U.S. from Latin America and has been linked to a serious birth defect.And in Geneva, the World Health Organization on Monday declared Zika's spread to be a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" a designation that kicks off a concentrated, global fight against the disease.The U.N. health agency convened an emergency meeting of independent experts in Geneva to assess the outbreak after noting a suspicious link between Zika's arrival in Brazil last year and a surge in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, the Associated Press reported.""After a review of the evidence, the committee advised that the clusters of microcephaly and other neurological complications constitute an extraordinary event and public health threat to other parts of the world,"" WHO Director-General Margaret Chan told reporters in Geneva.WHO estimates there could be up to 4 million cases of Zika in the Americas in the next year, but no recommendations were made to restrict travel or trade.On Capitol Hill, the House Energy and Commerce Committee said the U.S. homeland is at great risk as the virus creeps through more than 20 countries in the Americas.The threat of domestic transmission will only increase as temperatures rise, allowing more mosquitoes to breed.""Infectious disease models estimate as many as 200 million people in the U.S. live in areas that might be conductive to the spread of Zika during summer months,"" Committee Chairman Fred Upton, Michigan Republican, the committee's top Democrat, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, and four other members wrote to the Centers for Disease Control.The committee also asked the National Institutes of Health and Health and Human Services Department for an update on Zika - a virus of African origin that hadn't reached the Americas until spring of last year - and promised to hold a hearing in the coming weeks.The emerging threat is reminiscent of the Ebola scare that roiled the global health community and Congress in late 2014.WHO officials were criticized for their slow response to that outbreak, while the Obama administration resisted GOP calls to impose a travel ban on people from the most infected regions overseas.Though the diseases are different - Ebola killed more than 11,000 in West Africa, while Zika typically causes a mild illness - the latter's link to a birth defect has at-risk countries on edge.Though many infected persons do not show symptoms, Brazil and other Latin American countries have reported an uptick in the number of babies born with that abnormally small heads - a condition known as microcephaly.""The experts agreed that a causal relationship between Zika infection during pregnancy and microcephaly is strongly suspected, though not yet scientifically proven,"" Ms. Chan said Tuesday. ""All agreed on the urgent need to coordinate international efforts to investigate and understand this relationship better.""Zika has also been tied to Guillain-Barre, a condition that can lead to temporary paralysis, although that link hasn't been proven, either.Emergency declarations such as the one issued by WHO Monday are meant as an international SOS signal and usually trigger increased money and efforts to stop the outbreak, as well as prompting research into possible treatments and vaccines. WHO officials acknowledged they are under the microscope given the criticism over Ebola.""Of course, the world and the World Health Organization have all learned from the Ebola crisis,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said earlier Monday before the emergency was declared. ""That's why we are trying to bring in the best experts we can gather for this event, to try to establish what steps to take and what the way forward should be.""In Brazil, President Dilma Rousseff on Monday signed a new law allowing health officials access to any building - public or private - to eradicate breeding grounds for a mosquito spreading the Zika virus. Officials can also request backup from police to raid any building suspected of being a mosquito breeding ground, even if the owner is not present.Jimmy Whitworth, an infectious diseases expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the Associated Press it was important for WHO to act quickly, despite the lack of definitive evidence that Zika is responsible for the surge in microcephaly cases.""For situations like this, you have to essentially have a 'no regrets' policy,"" he said. ""Maybe this will be a false alarm when more information is available months later, but it's serious enough on the evidence we have right now that we have to act.""- This article was based in part on wire service reports. ","washingtontimes","right","16832","zika",819
"WASHINGTON -- Congress has so far failed to pass emergency funding to deal with the looming threat of the Zika virus, but the House passed a bill Tuesday that would use the mosquito-borne disease as a justification for rolling back clean water rules.The measure, recently renamed the Zika Vector Control Act, was first proposed in 2011 after court cases forced the Environmental Protection Agency to treat pesticides as pollution under the Clean Water Act when they're sprayed in or near water.The court order and the resulting EPA regulations angered many in the pesticide industry because it forced them to get a new permit to spray in certain circumstances, on top of a more general permit already required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.People in the pesticide industry said this was duplicative, although the court ruling specifically said that the broader pesticide permit fails to take into account whether or not a specific body of water is already polluted by the pesticide in question, which is the purview of the Clean Water Act.The 2011 bill that offered to roll back the new water protections, dubbed the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act, passed the House but never made it out of the Senate.The legislation that passed in the House Tuesday is nearly identical, except it has a sunset date of 2018.That prompted mockery from Democrats who opposed the measure.""What it should be called, perhaps, is the Pesticide Trojan Horse Act, which would be a more apt name for what this bill actually does,"" said Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) during a floor debate.Companies that deal in pesticides spend about $30 million a year lobbying Congress.While eliminating the clean water protections would make life easier for mosquito sprayers in some respects, environmental advocates say the restrictions on spraying are entirely irrelevant to a potential Zika outbreak for several reasons.First among them is that if one particular pesticide has polluted a certain lake or stream, there are other options, said Mae Wu, a policy expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council.""You can use other ones, so you can still tackle the problem you're trying to tackle,"" Wu said.On top of that, the clean water regulations apply only to areas larger than 6,400 acres. And if there is an outbreak, the rules specify that mosquito control authorities can act immediately, and get any needed permits after the fact.""If you want to spray for Zika, you can actually spray first,"" Wu said.Still, House Republicans, who have voted to pass only about a third of the money that the White House wants for Zika control, argued that not relaxing the clean water rules would endanger America.""We get one bite at this apple. We get one bite at Zika control,"" said Rep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.). ""We get one bite at making this a public health risk that does not balloon here in the United States of America. This bill gives us an opportunity to put our best foot forward.""Similarly, the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) posted a statement arguing that ""onerous new EPA regulations have completely hamstrung mosquito control activities.""The bill passed 258-156 Tuesday afternoon, with 23 Democrats voting aye.Some House Democrats tried to counter by offering an alternative that would instead fight Zika by funding the $1.9 billion request the Obama administration made in February. That ploy failed.It's not clear whether the Senate will take up the measure, since it could be blocked there by Democrats.Left unaddressed is how and when Congress will get around to responding to a disease that causes microcephaly in developing fetuses, among other ailments. So far, some 300 pregnant women in the U.S. who contracted the disease abroad or through sexual contact are being monitored for the health effects.The Senate passed a $1.1 billion anti-Zika funding measure last week, but attached it to a spending bill that has no equivalent version in the House.The House has passed a $622 million funding bill that depends on taking money from Ebola research, and there is no standalone companion measure to that legislation in the Senate.Asked Tuesday what the path forward is on combating the virus, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) offered no specifics, but said it was a priority to pass something quickly.""We're negotiating the Zika package as we speak, and we'll let you know how it comes out,"" McConnell said.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) countered that Congress shouldn't be going on another vacation at the end of the week if it can get the Zika funding passed.""We shouldn't leave town for Memorial Day recess unless we get money for the Zika crisis facing America,"" Reid told reporters. ""Under the present program we're not going to get any money for Zika, at our very best, until sometime this fall. That will be a time when lot of mosquitoes are leaving town.""The pesticide bill is not the first attempt by the GOP to leverage the Zika crisis for other purposes. Last week, Republicans tied the Zika issue to a Senate bill that included a rollback of trucking safety rules. And Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) tried to extract cuts to Obamacare in return for passing Zika funding.","huffingtonpost","left","16945","zika",902

In an announcement Monday, the White House said the money would be used to expand mosquito control programs, speed development of a vaccine, develop diagnostic tests and improve support for low-income pregnant women.Zika virus disease is mainly spread by mosquitoes. Most people who catch it experience mild or no symptoms.

Explosives were suspected at first, but there was no evidence of that, just a small crater and a dark blue stone resembling a diamond found at the scene.

They got the name ""buffalo soldiers"" from the Cheyenne and other Plains tribes because Indians saw a resemblance between their dark, curly hair and the matted cushion between the horns of the buffalo. Between 1891 and 1913, the Army was the administrator of Yosemite and Sequoia national parks, helping create a model for park management still used today. Some 500 buffalo soldiers served in the two parks. Their duties included confiscating firearms, curbing poaching of wildlife, suppressing wildfires, ending illegal grazing of livestock on federal lands, stopping timber thieves, building roads, trails, and other infrastructure, tasks they carried amid ferocious racism. In the winter, the soldiers were garrisoned at the Presidio of San Francisco, serving in the Sierra only during the summer. It was a much-loved assignment, and one army officer called the Sierra Nevada the ""Cavalryman's Paradise."" Most of those who served were veterans of the Philippines wars. Their officers were mostly white men, but Charles Young was an exception. He was the third African American graduate of the U.S. military academy at West Point and served as the acting military superintendent of Sequoia National Park in 1903, making him the first black superintendent of any national park.  January Arctic sea ice at lowest ever recorded: High air temperatures and a strong negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation were in evidence for the first three weeks of the month. Arctic sea ice extent during January averaged 5.2 million square miles, 402,000 square miles below the 1981 to 2010 average.

"The Senate is poised to approve $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus - but rejected a move Tuesday to pay for the new spending, after Democrats said there is neither the time nor enough waste to cut elsewhere in the country's $4 trillion budget.Senators voted 68-29 to head off a potential filibuster of the Zika money, clearing the way to attach the spending as part of a bill that will fund transportation and housing agencies next year.President Obama wants far more money - some $1.9 billion - but the Senate rejected that figure.Democratic senators also rejected a GOP-led effort to siphon money from Obamacare to pay for the effort, with the White House saying the mosquito-borne virus is such a danger that the money should be spent immediately, and the price tag tacked onto the debt.""Traditionally, when Congress has been faced with a public health emergency, they haven't wasted a lot of time looking for funding offsets. And that's a pretty dangerous exercise because it delays the needed funding but it also risks gutting other critical priorities,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.Fiscal conservatives say that approach is irresponsible, but the administration and its Democratic allies said they didn't want to search the federal budget for offsets.Mr. Obama submitted his Zika request to Congress about three months ago. He still insists that scientists need almost $2 billion to develop and better diagnostic test and vaccine for Zika, which causes birth defects, while bolstering efforts to kill the mosquitoes that ferry the virus.Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican who negotiated the $1.1 billion compromise, said he axed parts of the president's request that were unnecessary or couldn't be enacted on an emergency basis.The Senate still has to adopt the package as part of the funding bill. Once it has, GOP leaders plan to meld their proposal with a House proposal that uses $352 million in leftover funds from the Ebola fight in West Africa and $270 million from other health accounts to fight Zika.Mr. Obama threatened Tuesday to veto the House bill, saying it and would undermine efforts to stamp out the Ebola and avoid a repeat of the outbreak that killed thousands in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.The administration wants to backfill the $510 million it already took from the Ebola fight, rather than tap that account again.As it stands, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recorded 500 travel-related cases of Zika in the states and the District, a handful of them through sexual transmission, and scientists say the virus could puncture the mainland further once temperatures climb and disease-carrying mosquitoes flourish.Florida has reported about a fifth of the cases so far, prompting Sen. Marco Rubio to break with his GOP colleagues and support the $1.9 billion funding level, though he tried to distance himself from the administration's plan.""Fine, it came from the White House,"" Mr. Rubio, a former presidential candidate, said Tuesday. ""But it's really the scientists' request, the doctors' request, the public health sector's request for how to address this issue.""Three Republicans facing re-election this year - Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Rob Portman of Ohio - joined Mr. Rubio in supporting the $1.9 billion measure, as did Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican whose state is vulnerable to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry Zika.Every Republican who voted Tuesday backed an amendment by Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, to cover Zika costs with prevention and public health funds from the Health and Human Services Department.It failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance, 52-45, after one Senate Democrat blasted the option as ""even dumber"" than the $1.1 billion option that fell $800 million short of Mr. Obama's request.""You heard that right,"" said Sen.

"ANALYSIS/OPINION:This do-nothing Congress has yet to declare war on the Zika virus and its attendant microcephaly manifestations. As usual, both houses feel compelled to play their little money games; the Senate's $1.1-billion proposal is part of a herculean transportation-spending bill, which includes weakening trucker rest regulations favored by the trucking industry. The House's $622 million appropriation is not much better.Congressional types lack even the ability to agree on funding thresholds or proffer stand-alone legislation - even though Zika is an issue that could ultimately threaten the national security of the United States.The travesty of this situation is the fact that these congressional actions should have been implemented last February, when the president offered his first-case funding proposal to fight this viral scourge. Now it may be too late to defend against what assuredly will be Zika's viral visit upon this nation later this summer.Then again, we have Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican, telling us not to worry, that Congress will fund the ""Zika fight."" Anytime a politician says ""Don't worry,"" it's time to worry. ","washingtontimes","right","16961","zika",187
"The Zika virus outbreak in Latin America has governments on the other half of the globe panicking. From Singapore to Taiwan to Russia, governments are taking precautionary measures to stop the virus, which experts have linked to significant neurological defects in infants, from spreading out of tropical regions across the continent.Zika is transmitted through mosquito bites from Aedes Aegypti, a mosquito that lives in warm, humid climates, and transmits Dengue fever, Yellow Fever, and Chikungunya virus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the mosquito can be found worldwide.Several nations in warmer Asian climates have begun to react to the Zika outbreak in Latin America so far, which is believed to have triggered over 4,000 cases of microcephaly in infants. Microcephaly is a condition in which infants' skulls are smaller than their brains, causing severe neurological damage. The island of Singapore, which is striving to eliminate Dengue fever among its population, has begun to introduce new preventative measures to keep pregnant women safe (Zika is not typically considered a fatal illness among adults).""There is a high risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. As such, the virus may become endemic in Singapore,"" Singapore's top health agency announced this week. The government will begin an awareness campaign, discouraging travel to Latin America and educating citizens on how to avoid mosquito bites. Althought minimal evidence exists of human-to-human Zika transmission, Singapore officials will limit contact with those testing positive for the virus at hospitals. One official described the arrival of Zika to the island as ""inevitable.""Asia One notes that officials have documented Zika cases in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand. At least one Thai case has surfaced in Taiwan, where authorities diagnosed a Thai national with Zika on Tuesday after his arrival to Taiwan on a work visa.Elsewhere in Asia, the Maldives has diagnosed at least one case: a Finnish tourist who appeared to have contracted the virus in the Maldives ast year. As he did not exhibit severe symptoms, he returned home. At least one patient contracted the virus in Malaysia in May of last year, as well.An average of 80 percent of Zika patients have no outward symptoms of having contracted the virus. Its ability to live inside human beings undiscovered is particularly dangerous for pregnant women who may not know they have the virus until they give birth to a child with severe neurological defects.Asia's tropical nations are not the only ones working to keep Zika from entering their borders. Speaking on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed his health minister to pay attention to ""some filth spreading from Latin America,"" beginning an awareness campaign for Russian travelers. ""Of course, mosquitoes do not fly across the ocean, but infected people can fly and do. The virus has already appeared in Europe,"" Putin told reporters.The CDC notes that Samoa is also under risk of a Zika outbreak.In response to the outbreak, Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador have warned women to avoid becoming pregnant as much as possible until authorities can conclusively curb the Aedes aegypti population or find a cure for Zika. El Salvador went as far as to caution delaying pregnancy for two years if possible.","breitbart","right","16828","zika",549
"They bite during the day and find humans tastier than the rest of the animal kingdom - and that's exactly what makes the Aedes mosquito so dangerous.Well, that and the fact that it carries the Zika virus, which has terrified the globe.""There is the enemy,"" Dr. Tom Frieden, chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Congress as he projected an image of the bug on screen last week, calling for a massive effort - with a staggering $1.8 billion price tag - to combat the danger.The Zika virus is an obscure agent that festered in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region for decades before it made its way to Brazil by early 2015. Since then, it has been linked to a major uptick in microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with abnormally small heads - raising the stakes around a virus that otherwise typically causes mild symptoms and more often none at all.It also means the Aedes aegypti mosquito is now a primary foe in at least 25 Latin American countries.The U.S. is bracing for a fight of its own, once temperatures climb and mosquitoes proliferate. Aedes aegypti populations tend to be limited to a few Southern states, such as Florida and Texas, and many American homes and businesses employ air conditioning or have screened-in windows, forcing the mosquitoes outside.Scientists say the species thrives on coasts and could expand its northern reach in the summertime.Another mosquito, the Aedes albopictus, is more prevalent in the U.S. and has spread Zika in a laboratory setting.Whether that poses a problem will be become clear in the next few months as Zika pushes north and threatens U.S. shores, said Grayson Brown, a professor of entomology at the University of Kentucky. Mr. Brown said the albopictus is also native to such islands as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.""If albopictus is going to drive an outbreak, we'll see it on those Caribbean islands"" first, he said.For now, it is the aegypti form that is upending federal budgets, travel plans and Rio de Janeiro's hopes of hosting a successful Olympics in August.Lurking in closets and other tight spaces, the wily perpetrators strike at any time of day. Brazil is so fed up that it has declared ""war"" on the bugs, plastering their likeness everywhere - like ""Most Wanted"" posters.Entomologists describe the Aedes aegypti as a highly adaptable menace, shrugging off adverse conditions such as drought while hatching their young in ad hoc delivery rooms - tin cans, birdbaths, tree holes, old tires, flower pots and so on.""It can breed in a bottle cap,"" said Jason Rasgon, associate professor of disease epidemiology at Pennsylvania State University.Scientists say an old-school version of the mosquito lives in tree holes such as those in the Zika Forest of Uganda - the virus' namesake. It has a relatively balanced diet, unlike a domestic version that has developed an affinity for human flesh and tends to makes itself at home among humans instead of flying away.That ability to thrive in human residences limits the ability to wipe out populations with sprays, much less toxic compounds such as DDT.""In many ways, it's an ideal urban mosquito,"" said Michael Kaufman, associate professor of entomology at Michigan State University.A number of triggers attract the mosquitoes to humans, including the carbon dioxide we breathe, body heat and certain compounds in human odors.The females, which do the biting, use blood to nurture their eggs. But the aegypti mosquitoes plaguing Latin America also use blood as a source of nutrition - there isn't enough sugar around to sustain themselves - so they tend to feed more often.""It will sometimes bite four humans in one feeding, and therefore it spreads the disease quickly,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told senators last week.The Obama administration is pleading with Congress to authorize Mr. Obama's request for emergency funds, saying the Zika threat requires a multipronged approach, including development of a vaccine and vector control.Scientists say Aedes populations can be managed as long as everyone in a given community is committed to the fight.""You have to make it socially unacceptable to have mosquitoes, the way you make it socially unacceptable to drive drunk,"" Dr. Brown said.Hoping to set the right tone, the Brazilian Health Ministry moved last month to knock out standing water in federal buildings across the country, saying ""a mosquito is no stronger than a whole country.""For now, U.S. officials have urged pregnant women to defer travel to countries where the virus is spreading. Officials advise those who must go to such areas to wear long sleeves, apply insect repellent and take other measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites.Entomologists say Zika certainly isn't the first mosquito-borne illness to plague humans - the same insects carry yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya - and it won't be the last. Although the fight may be tense, there is no reason to take it personally.""Mosquitoes are just trying to make a living,"" Mr. Rasgon said. ""They're not trying to kill us."" ","washingtontimes","right","16845","zika",859
"The White House budget chief told Congress Monday that President Obama would like to free up some, but not all, of the leftover money from the Ebola fight to combat the Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects in Latin America.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican, told the Office of Management Budget last week that about $2.7 billion of the $5.3 billion Congress set aside to combat Ebola hadn't been used, so the administration should look to that money before asking for nearly $2 billion more to fight Zika, the latest global health scare.OMB Director Shaun Donovan appeared ready to meet the chairman halfway Monday, saying Mr. Obama's $1.9 billion request - formally submitted Monday - asks Congress to free up Ebola funding set aside for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development.""While the Zika supplemental request reflects our best estimate given current information of potential needs to address Zika there remains significant uncertainty around the scope of the Zika challenges we will face.  Being able to use unplanned State/USAID Ebola funds will give us the flexibility to respond to Zika needs beyond what we have so far identified,"" he said in a letter to Mr. Rogers.Mr. Rogers' figures last week put that amount at about $1.3 billion. However, the committee said $1.4 billion to the Health and Human Services Department also hasn't been used, so there is still disagreement between the parties.In his letter, Mr. Donovan said the ""magnitude of the Zika outbreak primarily requires new resources to ensure it is adequately addressed.""""My foremost priority is to protect the health and safety of Americans,"" Mr. Obama said in a letter to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican. ""This request supports the necessary steps to fortify our domestic health system, detect and respond to any potential Zika outbreaks at home, and to limit the spread in other countries.""The administration says efforts to stamp out Ebola aren't complete and will take awhile, as hard-hit countries rebuild their infrastructure and scientists pursue a vaccine against the virus, which killed 11,000 in West Africa from December 2013 to late 2015.""We must remain vigilant and continue to direct resources toward Ebola until we are sure that Ebola will not resurge in West Africa,"" he wrote.The emerging Zika threat is causing alarm across Latin America, where researchers have said the virus' spread coincides with an uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads - a condition known as microcephaly.As it stands, labs have confirmed 84 cases of Zika within the continental U.S. because travelers brought the virus back with them. Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa are reporting local transmission.""Our response to this disease must be immediate, and emergency funding is the most expedient manner to deploy critical resources to respond to Zika virus both domestically and internationally, while continuing our efforts to respond to Ebola,"" Mr. Donovan wrote. ","washingtontimes","right","16853","zika",492
"The House Science, Space and Technology Committee chairman called on the Obama administration Wednesday to raise the alert level for travel to countries with high Zika virus infection rates, despite the potential impact on attendance at the Olympic Games in Brazil.Rep. Lamar Smith, Texas Republican, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a level 2 travel alert for 49 countries and territories, which advises travelers to ""practice enhanced precautions,"" instead of a level 3 alert, which recommends against nonessential travel.""Why has the administration not raised the travel alert level for countries with the highest number of Zika infections, such as Brazil and Colombia?"" Mr. Smith asked in a statement. ""Is the administration so worried about attendance at the Olympics in Brazil this summer that they're willing to endanger American lives by not providing better warnings?""He made the comments after a hearing on the Zika virus with congressional Republicans and the White House locked in a battle over how to stop the spread of the mosquito-borne disease.President Obama has asked for a $1.9 billion emergency appropriation, while House Republicans have countered with a $622 million proposal and the Senate has agreed to allocate $1.1 billion.In a Tuesday op-ed, Sen. James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican, accused Mr. Obama of raiding $500 million from a State Department fund for spending on climate change instead of the Zika virus.

""Congress refused to allocate funding for the U.N. Climate Change Fund last year, so the president used this account designated for international infectious diseases to pay for his priority.""Mr. Smith issued his call for a heightened travel warning after a House committee hearing titled ""Zika Virus: The DNA of an Epidemic,"" which featured specialists on infectious diseases.""At the least, pregnant women should be told to avoid nonessential travel to Brazil and Colombia,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Anything less is putting political correctness ahead of the well-being of American women.""Three witnesses agreed that the Obama administration should raise the travel alert in the case of pregnant women, if not all travelers. The mosquito-born virus has been linked to birth defects in newborns, specifically microcephaly, a rare brain defect.A study released Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine found a ""strong association between the risk of microcephaly in a newborn and the risk of Zika virus infection during the mother's first trimester of pregnancy.""The estimated risk of microcephaly with pregnant women who contract the virus in the first trimester ranges from 1 percent to 14 percent, far higher than the U.S. risk with noninfected women of 0.02 percent to 0.12 percent.""This gave us an appreciation that the risk is substantial,"" Michael Johansson, a CDC biologist and the study's lead author, told The Associated Press.The research was conducted by CDC scientists on about 400 babies with microcephaly from July through February in the Brazilian state of Bahia.""The association in the second and third trimesters was negligible,"" said the study,The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, scheduled for Aug. 5-21, are expected to draw more than 600,000 visitors and athletes to Brazil.The World Health Organization has identified 270,000 suspected cases of the Zika virus across 60 countries, while the CDC has found 544 cases in the continental United States. Almost all those cases were acquired through travel to high-risk areas, and more than 300 of those involved pregnant women, according to the CDC. ","washingtontimes","right","16946","zika",609
"HONOLULU -- Hawaii and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials confirmed Friday that a mother and newborn baby on the island of Oahu tested positive for a past Zika virus infection. The baby was born with microcephaly, a serious birth defect in which a baby is born with an abnormally small head and possible developmental problems.It's the first case of brain damage linked to the virus in the United States.Officials said it is likely the mother contracted the mosquito-borne illness while she was in Brazil last year during the early part of her pregnancy. Brazil saw an outbreak of Zika in 2015, with an estimated 500,000 to 1.5 million residents infected.While the virus is fairly harmless in adults -- symptoms include rash, fever, joint-pain and red eyes -- Brazil's outbreak coincided with a massive spike in microcephaly in babies. While Brazil had an average of 156 babies born each year between 2010 and 2014 with microcephaly, 2015 saw more than 3,000 instances. Although the link is not fully understood, health officials now believe the virus can have considerable effects on unborn fetuses. Hawaii State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park told The Huffington Post the mother had alerted doctors to her bout of Zika, which she recovered from before relocating to Hawaii. She was monitored closely during her pregnancy, which progressed normally. However, the baby's condition was not known until birth. The Hawaii mother and baby are not infectious according to the state's Department of Health, so there is no risk of transmission on the island. But Hawaii's Big Island is currently battling the state's largest outbreak of dengue fever, another mosquito-borne illness, in 50 years. More than 200 cases have been reported between Sept. 2015 and Dec. 2015.Dengue fever, which can violently affect adults, is transmitted by some of the same mosquitoes as Zika, though it is not thought to affect fetuses in the same way.  The pattern of dengue fever in Hawaii is concerning, however, because according to The New York Times, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control ""recently predicted that Zika would follow the same pattern that dengue has, with local transmission during hot weather in tropical parts of the country, including Florida, the Gulf Coast and Hawaii."" According to Dr. Park, Hawaii's current Fight the Bite campaign aims to address all mosquito-borne illnesses, not just dengue.""They all can be combated in the same way,"" Dr. Park told HuffPost, after highlighting the need for a state-wide campaign that raises awareness and educates the public on the dangers of mosquito hot-beds like standing water. Because of the Zika outbreak in Brazil, the CDC released travel warnings on Friday concerning Central America, South America, and some islands in the Caribbean. Travelers to these areas should take special precautions against mosquito bites, including wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants and using insect repellants. Pregnant women should consider avoiding the region all together, the agency urged.The Hawaii newborn ""further emphasizes the importance of the CDC travel recommendations released today,"" Dr. Park said.There is currently no vaccine to prevent Zika or medicine to treat it. ","huffingtonpost","left","16816","zika",532
"An American researcher, who identified the Zika virus as a potential threat in 2009, tells the journal Wired that it would have been impossible to attain funding to research Zika exclusively five years ago, as few believed it had the potential to cause an outbreak as large as that currently underway in Latin America.""Frankly it would have been impossible for me or anyone else to get grant to work on Zika,"" Scott Weaver, a medical entomologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch,"" tells Wired, discussing a grant he and a colleague received to study yellow fever and chikungunya virus in Senegal in 2011. Both yellow fever and chikungunya, along with dengue fever and Zika, are spread through bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Weaver used the opportunity to study Zika as well but deems its presence in his paper an afterthought.One of the potential reasons it took scientists so long to consider Zika a threat appears in Weaver's 2011 paper: African populations appeared to be resistant to the virus. ""A serological study in Nigeria showed that 40% of an urban population had neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV,"" the scientists write. Weaver tells Wired with some surprise that it was ""amazing"" he and colleague William Reisen of UC Davis mentioned Zika as a threat in a 2009 paper. ""You usually get these kinds of things wrong,"" he notes.Robert Tesh, the head of the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch, describes Zika as an ""orphan virus"" in the Wired piece. It generated little interest before the end of 2015 in the scientific community because it posed little threat to humans, or so many medical experts believed.The Zika virus does not trigger any symptoms in 80 percent of humans infected, and only mild symptoms in most who do show them: conjunctivitis, fever, and rashes. It tends to clear up within a week.The rapid spread of Zika through Latin America - particularly Brazil, which has documented 1.5 million cases - has changed the medical community's outlook on the virus. Its prevalence has also revealed the possibility that Zika can cause severe deformities in infants and a crippling muscular ailment in adults. Brazil has recorded over 4,000 cases of microcephaly, a deformity in which a child is born with neurological damage stemming from an undersized skull, in newborns, all suspected of having been triggered by the mother's infection with Zika. In addition, doctors have diagnosed an increasing number of Zika patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, which causes severe muscle aches, paralysis, and death.Weaver's conclusion that it would have been impossible to receive a grant to study Zika in 2011 echoes more recent concerns from the Brazilian virologist largely considered to have discovered the presence of Zika, an African virus, in Brazil. Gubio Soares confirmed the presence of Zika in infants with microcephaly in Brazil in April 2015. His discovery was largely considered inconsequential because of the widespread belief that Zika was not a threat to humans. ""Zika virus is not as serious as Dengue or Chikungunya,"" Soares himself said in April. He confesses to the Mexican outlet Oro Negro this week that he felt ""relief"" at having discovered it because ""reference books said that it was much less aggressive than the viruses that had already been in Brazil.""By January, however, when the threat Zika posed to the unborn had become clear, Soares noted that he could no longer work to understand Zika better because, simply, ""I have no funding."" He protested that ""I've never been invited by any official to develop a research project"" despite his pivotal role in identifying the outbreak.Soares implied to the New York Times on Thursday that he does not believe Brazilians are taking the threat of Zika too seriously, calling the widespread national celebration of Carnival this week ""absurd."" ""It's like Caesar in Rome: He gave the people circus and bread, but in Brazil we only get the circus,"" he lamented.Outside of Latin America, researchers who want to contribute to the fight against Zika have been frustrated by Brazil stringent laws regarding the sharing of physical virus samples. The scientific community worldwide is doing what it can to diminish the barriers that keep researchers from being able to share discoveries. In a statement, 11 journal publishers vowed to make freely available any new research on Zika, and 20 funding organizations vowed that they would contribute to speeding up the process of sharing information among those who receive grants from them. Their efforts do not cover physical samples of Zika, however.""Our source is simply the rich people who want a diagnosis,"" Dr. Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, an expert on mosquito-borne diseases at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, tells Science, noting that the only hope he has for obtaining live Zika is to find a patient that happens to turn to him for help.""It's a very delicate issue, this sharing of samples. Lawyers have to be involved,"" said Dr. Marcos Espinal, director of communicable diseases in the World Health Organization's regional office in Washington, told the Associated Press about obtaining Brazilian samples.This week, Brazilian authorities said that they had found a legal way to share live samples with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). It is not yet known when the CDC will obtain these samples.","breitbart","right","16842","zika",888
"The idea of morality plays a major role in public health from ""sin taxes"" on vices such as alcohol to sexually transmitted diseases.We've seen the effects these moral stands can have, most notably in the stigma attached to people with HIV, which prevented many from getting adequate treatment.How restrictions on women's reproductive rights will play out in the face of the Zika virus has yet to be determined.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 423 pregnant women in the United States and its territories have tested positive for the Zika virus as of June 9.As the United States enters its annual mosquito season, experts are concerned about the potential range of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes capable of spreading diseases like Zika.The areas most impacted by these flying pests are those along the southern border of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and the east coast as far north as Connecticut. States in the Bible Belt may be affected the most.The CDC is quick to point out the projections about how far the mosquitoes could spread are not meant to represent the risk for spread of disease. But the range does include states with some of the harshest restrictions on access to contraceptives and abortion services.Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues associate with the Guttmacher Institute, says these types of restrictions have created unintended consequences, as highlighted by the threat of Zika.""This is a really tough issue,"" she told Healthline. ""It crosses a lot of topics.""The latest battlegroundThe virus, spread through mosquitoes and sexual contact, causes fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, although many infected people may not show symptoms.Most importantly, it can cause birth defects such as microcephaly and other abnormalities that are collectively referred to Congenital Zika Syndrome. A child can be born with a smaller head and smaller brain, preventing proper development.These types of birth defects can be diagnosed via ultrasound around 28 weeks.One major problem is that many states that will be impacted more by the mosquitoes than others outlaw abortion after 20 weeks. Twelve states have already banned abortions at about 20 weeks after fertilization, and others are considering similar bans.Some states, including Indiana and North Dakota, ban abortion in cases of potential inherited genetic defects. While Zika isn't inherited, these laws may have a chilling factor, the Guttmacher Institute review found.""For someone who may seek to terminate their pregnancy because of Zika may have difficulty doing so,"" Nash said.One of the earliest noted cases of Zika involved a pregnant woman in Slovenia, who had worked in Brazil the year prior.While ultrasound showed normal growth at 20 weeks, doctors first noticed fetal abnormalities at 29 weeks. The woman chose to terminate her pregnancy at 32 weeks.Southern factorsAccording to a recent report in the Guttmacher Policy Review, many of the states that may be initially impacted by Zika aren't well equipped to deal with the problems of the disease.These troubles include insurance rates, access to reproductive care, and rates of accidental pregnancies.States in the potential mosquito danger zone also have the highest rate of uninsured women of reproductive age as well as high unintended pregnancy rates. These include Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi.The most potentially unprepared state, the Guttmacher paper found, is Texas. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on an abortion case stemming from Texas regarding access to abortion services in the state.""Texas is emblematic of what's occurring across the South,"" Nash said.Texas state legislators didn't meet this year, so they couldn't even consider the issue. But other states legislatures that meet every year still weren't discussing the potential impact of Zika, which Nash found fascinating.""Zika wasn't on their radars,"" she said. ""Given the high profile of Zika, to see those connections aren't being made is alarming.""The original article can be found on Healthline.com.","huffingtonpost","left","16976","zika",682

But the right-wing Barry Goldwater Institute for Public Policy Research, which normally deals with issues of private property and government regulations, views the ICWA as providing ""separate, unequal, and substandard treatment"" to Indian children and is an attempt to keep tribal numbers high. Virgin Islands AG subpoenas Competitive Enterprise Institute in a widening of the investigations into Exxon and other companies on denier climate change propaganda:The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington, D.C., think tank and one of the fossil fuel industry's most steadfast allies, disclosed on Thursday that the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands is demanding to see records of the group's donors and activities involving climate policy.The subpoena represents a broadening of a multifaceted legal inquiry into whether fossil fuel companies broke any laws as they sought for decades to undermine the scientific consensus and head off forceful action to address the climate crisis. On today's Kagro in the Morning show: an in-depth look at the process of locking down delegates, the role money plays in this inside baseball.

"A new study finds that up to 2.2 billion people worldwide are at risk of contracting the Zika virus, which can cause irreparable damage to unborn children and painful nerve damage.The study adds to the woes looming over Brazil - the epicenter of the Zika outbreak - as the nation prepares to welcome thousands for the 2016 Summer Olympics.The study - published in eLife, a medical journal - uses a different metric than previous studies to find the range where the virus can be expected to spread. Scientists have found two ways of contracting Zika: a bite from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a carrier, or transmission through sexual contact with a person carrying Zika. Previous studies attempted to tie Zika's spread to the range of Aedes aegypti by documenting the spread of other diseases tied to the mosquito, such as Chikungunya, Dengue, or yellow fever.""We are the first to add the very precise geographic and environmental conditions data we have on Zika,"" Dr. Oliver Brady, who worked on the study, told the BBC. The study consists of a map that documents at-risk areas. 2.2 billion people live in the areas cited.""Mosquitoes are just one condition needed for Zika to spread but there's a whole range of other ones. It needs to be warm enough for Zika to replicate inside the mosquito and for there to be a large enough [human] population to transmit it,"" Dr. Brady added.The Zika virus originated in Africa, but the current outbreak began in Brazil, where the government has documented 4,000 cases of microcephaly believed to have been triggered by the Zika virus. Microcephaly is a birth defect in which a child's skull is too small for his or her brain, crushing the brain and severely limiting the child's cognitive abilities. There are few estimates of the number of Zika cases in Brazil in general because of the nature of the virus; up to 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic, and many mothers do not know they have had Zika until they give birth to a baby with microcephaly.Zika panic has been exacerbated in Brazil by weak medical infrastructure. An exposé in the Los Angeles Times found that the Summer Olympics host city, Rio de Janeiro, was forced to limit its services because of a lack of funding, leaving medical workers unpaid and ill-equipped to perform basic services. The Times also witnessed patients waiting for extended periods of time as doctors tried to fix old and faulty machinery.The LA Times notes that doctors there have nonetheless concluded that the cases of microcephaly they have seen linked to Zika are significantly worse than those they see caused by alcohol or drug consumption during a pregnancy. The feature also found that, for mothers of children with Zika-induced microcephaly, among the most painful aspects of raising their child is social curiosity. ""People come up to me and want to look at the size of her head,"" one mother tells the Times. ""They are surprised because they think her head is not that small. They say babies with microcephaly are ugly babies.""Brazil's government has deployed 220,000 soldiers to the hardest-hit areas to help clean potential mosquito nests and raise awareness about how to prevent Zika, as well as convince couples to forgo having children if they can. It is the largest military operation in the history of Brazil.A Brazilian ad agency has also developed a novel way to trap the offending mosquitos: billboards that simulate the smell of human sweat, attracting mosquitos and then trapping them. The billboards have been installed in Rio de Janeiro.Brazilian authorities do appear concerned that some Olympics facilities will not be completed in time. Part of the problem is a massive corruption probe that has ensnared dozens of politicians and involved multiple Olympic venues. On Wednesday, a federal prosecutor confirmed to Reuters that multiple Olympics projects are being investigated.Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, faces impeachment for illegally misrepresenting the state of the Brazilian economy. Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of the House of Representatives responsible for the impeachment push, is being investigated for taking up to $5 million in bribes on infrastructure projects.The scandal has hit the Olympics, as major officials have resigned in disgust. Citing his personal ""shame,"" the official in charge of Olympic security resigned earlier this month. The minister of tourism resigned a week earlier, citing a lack of confidence in the president.","breitbart","right","16913","zika",737
"Last week, the CDC revealed that at least 157 women are infected with Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that can produce miscarriages, stillbirths, and ghastly birth defects. The news comes in the wake of ongoing Republican refusal to provide adequate funding for research and treatment of the disease. Republicans seem determined to create a society in which women and their babies cannot win. They want to ban abortion even for painful and untreatable birth defects, but they also do not want to provide funding for research and treatment that could prevent those birth defects in the first place. The message seems clear: women who choose to have children should be indefinitely punished, even when those children are wanted children conceived within a loving marriage.Zika: What We Know Now A few months ago, a rumor began circulating that Zika was caused by pesticides, not by mosquitoes. We now know that to be completely false, and telling women not to use bug spray actually increases their risk of Zika. Of course, if Zika were caused by pesticides, it would be a lot easier to control. Yet the more we learn, the scarier things get:The rate of microcephaly, which causes a range of disabilities, is 13% in women infected with Zika during pregnancy. Though Zika causes only mild symptoms in most adults, it directly attacks fetal brains. In one recent study, doctors watched as it melted fetal brain cells in utero. Most birth defects affect babies during the first trimester, but there is no safe time for Zika. In one study of women infected with the virus, Zika killed babies as late as 35 weeks gestation. In addition to miscarriage and stillbirth, Zika is linked to a cornucopia of birth defects, such as small brains, development disabilities, seizures, low birth weight, and dozens of other symptoms.Republican Zika Obstructionism Though Zika is present in the US, with 591 reported cases, there are no locally transmitted cases yet. All current Zika cases involve people who contracted the virus while traveling to other countries, or who contracted it after sexual contact with an infected person. This is good news for pregnant women, since their odds of contracting Zika are low unless they travel outside the country. But as Zika cases rise and spring turns to summer, Zika may begin infecting American women. Now is the best time to research options for treating with or preventing the virus, yet Republicans have steadfastly refused to fund research and treatment.President Obama has requested $1.9 billion in funding to research and control Zika, and Republicans have delayed for three months. This month, they suggested drawing funds from other sources first, potentially crippling research and treatment for other diseases, including Ebola. Why Zika Matters in the Abortion DebateConservative politicians have long claimed a moral high ground in the abortion debate, arguing that they are committed to the lives of the unborn. The ongoing fight over Zika funding undermines this claim. Fighting Zika now, before it travels to the US, is the best hope women and their babies have for happy, healthy lives. Given that the virus causes a fetal death rate of 30% or higher, Zika funding now could save the lives of the unborn fetuses Republicans claim to care so much about. It seems they would rather allow women and their babies to suffer, potentially running up a massive health care bill, and subjecting untold thousands of people to indefinite unnecessary suffering.Abortion Clinics Online offers comprehensive, accurate information to women seeking abortions.

"To date, there has not been a single case of the Zika virus contracted in the United States. But experts generally believe it's only a matter of time before there are clusters of the virus spread by mosquitoes here. And given that summer -- i.e. mosquito season -- is upon us, a lot of parents and parents-to-be suddenly feel like they're on high alert about the virus for the first time.Though the disease is usually pretty mild, it can cause rash, fever, and joint pain, plus Zika infection during pregnancy can lead to birth defects, including microcephaly. What repellents are safe to use? Here's what you need to know about keeping yourself, and your family, safe. When in doubt, go with DEET.There is no vaccine to help protect against Zika, so preventing mosquito bites is key. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using an EPA-registered insect repellent, which includes a few different options, but experts like Omar Akbari, an assistant professor in the department of entomology at the University of California, Riverside, really believe DEET is the best.""DEET is the oldest option. It was produced by the military and has been on the market since the gold standard,"" he told The Huffington Post. ""It has gone through the most tests."" People sometimes worry about the potential toxicity of DEET, but the CDC says it is absolutely safe for pregnant and nursing women, as well as children age 2 months or older. Even the Environmental Working Group, which works to improve consumer safety when it comes to potentially harmful personal care products, has concluded that DEET is generally safer than many people think. ""The most effective mosquito repellant with the longest duration of effect is DEET,"" agreed Dr. Ericka Hayes, an infectious disease specialist at St. Louis Children's Hospital, explaining that duration of effect is directly linked to the concentration (so, the higher the concentration, the longer you're protected). The CDC makes it clear that there are no benefits to using a concentration over 50 percent, and Consumer Reports suggests avoiding repellents with concentrations that go above 30 percent. ""For younger children, generally you want to use lower concentrations [of] 10 percent to 30 percent,"" Hayes said. Also, don't let children under the age of 10 apply it themselves. If DEET's not your thing, there are alternative repellents.Picardin is a DEET alternative that has comparable efficacy to low concentrations of DEET, says Hayes -- and it's been pretty well studied. Other EPA-approved alternatives include a chemical called IR3535, as well as oil of lemon eucalyptus. However, parents who are intrigued by the more natural-sounding lemon eucalyptus oil should be aware of a couple things. First, it has been refined so that it's very different from an unprocessed tree oil, EWG points out. And it's not recommended for use in children younger than 3. The question of efficacy is a bit trickier. Just because something's been EPA-approved, doesn't mean it necessarily works all that well. Consumer Reports found that the best repellents for protecting against Aedes mosquitoes, which carry Zika, were a DEET-based option as well as one with 20 percent Picardin. They advised against using most products with natural plant oils because they simply weren't that effective, and some just outright failed.It's important to think beyond repellents. If your baby is 2 months or younger, you shouldn't use a repellant at all. Instead, if you're worried about protecting your infant, the CDC recommends putting mosquito netting over his or her crib, stroller, or carrier and dressing your baby in long clothing to avoid exposed skin. Same goes for anyone who is spending a lot of time outside, but particularly if you're pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant any time soon. And parents can also do simple things around the home to help prevent mosquito bites. ""Make sure that in your house, you have screens that are properly secured so that mosquitoes can't enter,"" said Akbari. If you have a pond or any area with standing water on your property, check to make sure there aren't mosquito larvae and treat it if there are. Even if Zika doesn't necessarily come to your area, these are simple steps parents can take to help keep mosquitoes at bay, he said. ""I think generally,"" Akbari chuckled, ""no one likes being bitten by mosquitoes.""","huffingtonpost","left","16940","zika",743
"Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, is calling an emergency meeting of the Latin American trade bloc Mercosur over the rapid spread of the Zika virus. As the virus spreads throughout the hemisphere, a Mercosur meeting indicates Brazil's concern for the economic repercussions of such an outbreak as much as the medical ones.Rousseff has also called for members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), which includes most Caribbean island nations as well as Colombia, Venezuela, and others on the South and Central American mainland, to participate in the fight against Zika.""In my [call for a meeting] I proposed that we also have a cooperative action in the fight against the Zika virus,"" Rousseff told reporters Wednesday, ""We will have a Mercosur meeting Tuesday in Montevideo [Uruguay] open to all CELAC nations, as well as Unasur [the South American Community of Nations].""Rousseff noted that ""the majority of countries are adopting a model similar to ours of using the armed forces as one of the organizational vectors in the fight to eradicate breeding grounds [for mosquitos] and the elimination of collections of water."" The Zika virus is spread through bites from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, found in every nation on the Western Hemisphere save Chile and Canada.Rousseff deployed 220,000 soldiers to travel to affected areas in a door-to-door campaign, raising awareness about the threats of Zika as well as distributing insect repellant to pregnant women and providing information on how to avoid mosquito bites. On Wednesday evening, the U.S. Pentagon confirmed that it would be involved in American efforts to keep the virus from spreading domestically, alongside the Department of Health and Human Services.The Zika virus causes muscle aches and fever in those affected, though up to 80 percent of patients will not experience any symptoms. To adults, it poses a minor threat. Since late December 2015, however, Brazilian medical authorities have seen an astronomical spike in cases of microcephaly in infants born to women who had contracted Zika while pregnant. Microcephaly is a condition in which the skull of the infant is too small for its brain, causing severe neurological damage.That Rousseff has turned to Mercosur, a trade bloc, suggests she and her administration are increasingly concerned regarding the economic ramifications of the outbreak. Mercosur's founding purpose is to enhance free trade in the region and strengthen national economies. Brazil remains its largest member despite major economic setbacks.As CNN notes, without taking Zika into consideration, Brazil's economic is contracting significantly, expected to shrink 3.5 percent in 2016. The outlet describes the situation as the worst since the 1930s. Many expected a major influx in tourism in August, when Rio de Janeiro will host the 2016 Summer Olympics, to revitalize the economy; the threat of significant harm from the virus may deter thousands from attending.Brazilian authorities have begun large-scale fumigation efforts at Olympic venues, hoping to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito before August. Authorities deployed more than 3,000 workers to clean out the Sambadrome, the central Olympic venue, and are expected to make daily cleaning rounds. August is also a winter month in Brazil, when the nation experiences less rain and becomes less fertile ground for insects.Whether these efforts will succeed remains unknown. Airlines have already begun offering refunds to travelers who no longer wish to risk their health in Latin America. British Airways is offering refunds for pregnant women in particular with tickets to Sao Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, and two cities in Mexico. American Airlines is offering a similar service requiring a doctor's note, and applicable for El Salvador, Honduras, Panama City, and Guatemala City. Other airlines are making similar offers, as well.Another major economic factor in play is the risk that Latin American populations will dwindle faster than anticipated. The governments of Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia have warned women to avoid pregnancies until the virus is contained if at all possible. ""Cautioning entire cohorts of women to put off childbearing for years could impact the demographic trajectories of countries, adversely affecting their economic prospects,"" PBS notes.","breitbart","right","16828","zika",679
"There are many things we don't know about Zika virus, the mosquito-borne disease that may infect three to four million people before the epidemic dies out, according to the World Health Organization. Experts suspect Zika may be responsible for thousands of babies born with birth defects and an increase in neurological disorders, but it's going to be a while before we have clear answers on if, and how, the virus actually causes these problems.On Monday WHO declared that clusters of these birth defects in French Polynesia and Brazil, as well as their possible link to Zika virus, are a public health emergency of international concern. The designation, which the international health agency has only ever applied to three other disease outbreaks, will marshal global resources to help research the virus and its possible connection to the birth defect microcephaly and neurological disorders like Guillain-Barre syndrome. The PHEIC declaration will also help expedite research on creating fast diagnostic tools, vaccines and cures. Complex, long-term studies are underway to assess the virus, WHO officials said. Until then, here's what we know about Zika and its potential causal link to these serious conditions. Zika virus is a disease that can produce mild symptoms such as fever, rash, conjunctivitis and joint pain. The disease is so mild, in fact, that researchers estimate about four out of five people infected with Zika virus won't even know they have it -- and those who do feel symptoms will only experience them for two to seven days.Zika is a type of flavivirus, which means it is closely related to other diseases like chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever. It's transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which also carries the other flaviviruses.The virus is named after the Zika forest in Uganda, where it was first isolated from a rhesus monkey in 1947.Handfuls of cases have popped up across Africa and parts of Asia, but researchers considered it an obscure illness until 2013, when it caused a widespread outbreak in French Polynesia. Eleven percent of the population sought care for symptoms. Then in 2015, the disease began to spread rapidly throughout Brazil, where it's estimated that more than one million people may have contracted the virus. Mosquito bites.Zika virus is a mosquito-borne disease, which means that if a mosquito bites a person infected with Zika virus and then bites a second person, that second person could contract the disease.The fact that Zika virus appears to coincide with Brazil's sharp increase in babies born with microcephaly suggests that pregnant mothers can also pass the virus on to their fetuses.There's also some early lab evidence to support this: Traces of the virus were found in the amniotic fluid samples of two pregnant women from Paraiba, Brazil, whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly via ultrasound, the Pan American Health Organization reported in December. Traces of Zika virus were also found in the blood of a microcephalic baby who died soon after birth.Some preliminary studies also suggest Zika virus could be transmitted sexually. One report from 2011 described how a husband who had traveled through Senegal, where he caught Zika virus, went home to Colorado. There he appears to have sexually transmitted the virus to his wife, who hadn't traveled with him, reports The New York Times. Then in 2013, scientists found traces of the virus in the semen of a man from French Polynesia, despite the fact that there were no more traces of the virus in his blood. The U.S.'s first locally transmitted case of Zika virus appears to confirm this research. Dallas health officials announced Feb. 2 that a resident contracted the disease by having sex with a person who had recently traveled to Venezuela. CDC officials later confirmed the mode of transmission. Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasized that mosquitos are the main mode of transmission for Zika virus in a press conference Jan. 28.""The science is clear to date that Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito,"" she said. Schuchat also pointed out that the virus is in the bloodstream very briefly. Most people who get it will clear it from their bloodstream in about a week.During the 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia, health officials there noted the outbreak coincided with a 20-fold increase in Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurological disorder in which a body's immune system attacks its own nerves. It can result in tingling in the extremities, muscle weakness and temporary paralysis. Most people will make a full recovery, but the syndrome can cause death in some rare cases. But it wasn't until 2015, during Brazil's outbreak, that scientists linked the outbreak to a severe birth defect called microcephaly. Microcephaly is when a baby is born with an abnormally small head, possibly because its brain didn't grow properly in the womb. The birth defect can result in lifelong complications like intellectual disability, developmental disorders and seizures.From 2010 to 2014, Brazil only saw an average of 156 cases of microcephaly per year. But from Oct. 2015 to Jan. 2016, Brazil has recorded over 4,000 reported cases, though they have been able to investigate and discard 462 initial diagnoses according to an update last month. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine or cure for Zika virus.The CDC expects there will be a few local transmissions of Zika virus in the U.S., while the WHO expects Zika virus to touch every country in the Americas except Canada and Chile, as those places aren't good environments for the kind of mosquito that transmits the disease.However, it's important to remember that a Zika outbreak in the U.S. is likely to be limited and short-lived, and that this isn't an issue most Americans should worry about. Generally, if you're not in any of the Latin American or Caribbean destinations with ongoing Zika virus transmission, you're not in any danger of getting bitten by Zika virus-carrying mosquitos. If you're a pregnant woman contemplating travel to these destination, the CDC advises you to postpone your trip. Barring that, all American travelers should follow the strictest mosquito bite prevention protocol while in these areas. They include wearing long sleeves and pants; treating clothing, gear and tents with permethrin; and using repellants with active ingredients like DEET, picaridin and IR3535.Scientists suspect that once you've been infected with Zika virus, it does confer immunity to future infections. However, Schuchat pointed out, they don't know how long this immunity lasts.""This is a fairly new virus in terms of what we understand of it, and so we try to keep an open mind,"" she said.It sure seems like it, but global health experts are reserving judgement on this until scientists gather more evidence.What we know for sure is that Brazil notified WHO about an alarming increase of babies born with microcephaly in Oct. 2015. They then later connected it to the country's ongoing and widespread outbreak of Zika virus, which began spreading dramatically in May of 2015. So far in preliminary tests, scientists have found some correlational evidence for the link between Zika virus and stunted brain development in babies. The CDC published research last week that suggests an association between the virus and the birth defect: among a cohort of 35 babies born with microcephaly in Brazil between Aug. to Oct. 2015, all of their mothers had either lived in or visited a Zika virus-affected area during pregnancy. Twenty-five of the babies had severe microcephaly, which is when the head circumference is more than three standard deviations below average for their age, and 17 had at least one neurological abnormality.Not all researchers think that Brazil's initial count of over 4,000 reported microcephalic infants are cases of true microcephaly, however, suggesting that the numbers may be spiking because more people are aware of the condition and looking for it. Schuchat concedes this may be true. In the press conference, she said microcephaly had a ""looseness"" about it. The condition can also be caused by chromosomal abnormalities, drug and alcohol abuse, severe malnutrition, and infections like German measles, chicken pox, toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus. Initial microcephaly diagnoses need to be double-checked, she said, and researchers have to make sure the condition wasn't caused by any other environmental factor.While a causal link between Zika and the birth defect is still unclear, the initial evidence was enough to prompt governments in Brazil, El Salvador, Colombia, Jamaica and Puerto Rico to advise women against getting pregnant. Zika virus itself is such a mild experience that only one in five people ever feel any symptoms. But we don't yet know whether a pregnant woman needs to experience symptoms for her fetus to be at risk of microcephaly, Schuchat said.In the face of this ambiguity, the CDC advises pregnant women who have just traveled from a Zika virus-affected country to tell their OB/GYN about their travels and monitor their fetus' progress with serial ultrasounds for signs of microcephaly.The jury (of scientists) is still out on this issue, but French Polynesia reported an unusual increase in central nervous system abnormalities in fetuses and infants during 2014 and 2015, around the same time the virus was spreading through the islands. While none of the mothers had experienced Zika symptoms, four tested positive for signs of flavivirus, the genus of viruses that includes Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, this suggests ""a possible asymptomatic [Zika virus] infection."" While scientists suspect that such injury to a fetus' brain occurs in the first trimester, there isn't currently enough information to judge whether or not contracting Zika virus is more or less risky at different stages of pregnancy, said Schuchat.""We do believe that the injury of microcephaly begins in the first trimester, but we don't believe we have sufficient knowledge now to know what, if any, effects infection in the second and third trimester would have,"" she said.Schuchat also said that while more research needs to be conducted, scientists don't believe getting Zika virus will have consequences for future pregnancies.""We believe this is a time-limited infection in women and men and children -- that people have symptoms up to a week, and so we don't think this is one where you have months or years of chronic viral infection that could cause harm to [a future] baby,"" she said.If you experienced any Zika virus symptoms during your travels or for up to two weeks after you get back, immediately alert your doctor, who will then decide whether or not to submit your blood sample for a Zika virus test. These can take up to two weeks to turn around and are conducted by a small number of specialized labs across the U.S.If you're symptomless, tell your OB/GYN about your travel and schedule an ultrasound as soon as possible to detect any brain or skull abnormalities that could reveal microcephaly. Consider scheduling a series of ultrasounds to closely monitor the development of your fetus, advises the CDC, and if your doctor finds evidence of possible microcephaly, consider getting an amniocentesis (which samples the amniotic fluid in the baby's environment) to test for the presence of Zika. This procedure can only be performed after 15 weeks of pregnancy and comes with a small risk of miscarriage.Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can be caused by many different kinds of infections. The CDC notes that two-thirds of those who develop GBS do so after being sick with diarrhea or a respiratory illness. Bacterial and viral infections can also trigger GBS, and in the very rarest of cases, it can also develop after a person receives a vaccination.Because of the sharp increase of Guillain-Barré syndrome in French Polynesia after its 2013 Zika outbreak, as well as the uptick in cases in Brazil, scientists believe Zika virus could be another illness that triggers the disorder.But just like the pregnancy connection, more research needs to be conducted to understand the link between Zika virus and this rare disorder.  Go to your doctor if you have any of these four symptoms: a rash, joint pain, fever or conjunctivitis. Let them know about where you went, and when. Even if it isn't Zika virus, it could be one of many other mosquito-borne diseases that need medical attention, like malaria or dengue fever. To bring down your symptoms, take over the counter drugs like acetaminophen or paracetamol (Tylenol, etc.), but do not take aspirin, ibuprofen or any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Rest and drink plenty of liquids.Perhaps most importantly, take extra care to prevent mosquito bites, as the insects may be able to transfer the virus from you to an uninfected person.This story was updated to include mention of the U.S.'s first locally transmitted case of Zika virus. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story swapped the percentage of people with Zika virus who are likely to be asymptomatic with those who are not. Only about one in 5 people with Zika virus will experience symptoms. ","huffingtonpost","left","16833","zika",2288

"Co-authored by:Kathleen Shears, Senior Science Writer, FHI 360Rose Wilcher, Director, Research Utilization, FHI 360In a statement declaring the clusters of birth defects that appear to be linked to Zika virus infection in Brazil ""a public health emergency of international concern,"" the World Health Organization recommends important measures for tackling this emerging infectious disease threat: improving surveillance, developing better diagnostic tests, intensifying vector control efforts and carrying out other prevention and treatment measures. More remarkable were calls from public health officials in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Jamaica for women to postpone pregnancy until more is known about the association between the Zika virus and microcephaly, a severe birth defect affecting the brains of newborns. Salvadoran health officials have even advised women to delay pregnancy until 2018, when the risk of being infected with Zika may be lower.The spread of Zika in the Americas adds urgency to the need to help all women -- and their male partners -- avoid unintended pregnancies. But, women and couples in countries affected by Zika face formidable barriers to achieving their fertility intentions, including lack of access to contraceptives and other reproductive health services, some of the world's most restrictive abortion laws and high rates of sexual violence.Placing the burden of protecting unborn children from the virus' effects solely on women who have limited reproductive rights and contraceptive options is discriminatory and unsustainable. Expanding access to reproductive health services must be part of a comprehensive response to the Zika virus, and these services should be supported in ways that protect and strengthen the reproductive rights of women and girls.Governments, local and international organizations, and donors can draw on a wealth of evidence about what works in family planning. Here are five ways to effectively integrate rights-based family planning into the response to Zika:1. Expand contraceptive options. Rates of modern contraceptive use in the affected region range from 34 percent in Haiti to 76 percent in Costa Rica. These rates tend to be much lower among women in rural areas and impoverished communities, who are likely to be at highest risk of Zika infection, and not all methods are equally effective. Expanding access to long-acting reversible contraceptives -- intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants -- and permanent methods such as vasectomy and tubal ligation is critical. With typical use, pregnancy rates may be 100 times higher among women who use shorter-acting methods such as oral contraceptives than they are among women choosing long-acting reversible methods.2. Improve access. Countries can expand access to a wider range of family planning services by adopting proven high-impact practices, such as developing an effective system to manage the supply chain for contraceptive commodities, deploying mobile outreach services, and training and supporting community health workers to provide family planning information, services and referrals. Integrating postpartum family planning into routine child immunization services and well-baby visits is another promising practice that could help programs reach women in the first year after they give birth -- a time when many women want to avoid pregnancy but do not use an effective contraceptive method.3. Engage men. Men have an equal stake in protecting their children from the birth defects that may be associated with Zika virus infection and an important role to play in preventing unintended pregnancies. Evidence shows that male involvement in family planning improves the health and survival of women and children. Simply bringing men into family planning clinics is not enough, though that's a good start. The most effective programs promote open communication, equality and shared decision-making between men and women. For example, an evaluation of a project with couples in Malawi found that contraceptive use rose as communication increased.4. Support youth. More than one-third of young women in Latin America and the Caribbean give birth before the age of 20, and almost half of sexually active adolescents in the region have an unmet need for contraception. Young people are often reluctant to seek care at family planning clinics for fear of stigma. However, establishing dedicated clinics or special services for youth has shown mixed results. Instead, experts recommend incorporating proven youth-friendly measures into existing services. The use of mobile phones to provide reproductive health information and link young people to youth-friendly services has also shown promise.5. Change gender norms.  Sexual violence is pervasive in the region (for example, 14 percent of women in Brazil and 47 percent of women in Peru reported ever experiencing sexual violence by an intimate partner), and women can be particularly vulnerable to violence during a crisis. Family planning programs should train counselors to screen clients for sexual violence and provide referrals to organizations that offer care, including emergency contraception and psychosocial support. Policymakers and programs must also address the underlying causes of sexual violence, which are rooted in gender inequality and discrimination against women. Research has shown that changing unequal gender norms at the community level -- not just at the individual level -- can help improve sexual and reproductive health, and efforts are underway to scale up effective approaches.Like other emerging infectious diseases that came before it, Zika has drawn attention to a dangerous gap in essential health services: the limited options available to many women who want to delay or avoid pregnancy. By integrating these five approaches into the response to Zika, we can begin to provide women and couples in the Americas with the family planning services they need to protect the health and well-being of their families.","huffingtonpost","left","16841","zika",930
"WASHINGTON -- Democrats played the baby card Wednesday in their push to get Congress to pass robust funding to combat the impending Zika crisis, bringing mothers, babies and noted pregnancy author Heidi Murkoff to Capitol Hill to make the pitch.With toddlers scrambling around the Lyndon Baines Johnson room just off the Senate floor, Murkoff, the author of What To Expect When You're Expecting, chided the legislative body for inaction in the face of an obvious threat.""I just have to wonder why Congress is not acting promptly and fully to live up to that universal, sacred responsibility of protecting moms and babies, of putting moms and babies before politics,"" Murkoff said.The Obama administration asked Congress for $1.9 billion in February to combat the mosquito-spread disease, which is linked to microcephaly in developing infants, as well as to other frightening ailments.So far, the Senate has passed just $1.1 billion as part of a much larger spending bill for which there is no equivalent measure in the House of Representatives yet. The House has passed only $622 million in a standalone measure that is paid for by taking funds from the effort to combat Ebola.Neither House nor Senate leaders have offered any way of resolving the differences as the Memorial Day vacation looms, despite pleas from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other experts, noted Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.).""We know it's coming to our country, and as the weather is getting warming, our nation's top medical experts say we must pass funding, on an emergency basis,"" Coons said.""I find it extremely difficult to understand how we could just ignore the advice of the CDC and our best medical experts,"" Coons added. ""Unfortunately though, that's what we're dealing with here in the Senate as we go into Memorial Day, which is the official start of summer and the mosquito season.""Chris Zahn, a doctor who is a vice president at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, warned that it was foolish to delay dealing with the Zika threat when it could cost some $10 million to treat each afflicted infant, according to CDC estimates.""As we approach summer and the height of mosquito season, this is going to make a significant impact on us. We need to make responsible investments now,"" Zahn said, adding that there are estimates from the World Health Organization that there will be three to four million cases of Zika in the Western Hemisphere in the next year. There are already some 300 pregnant women infected with disease in the United States and its territories, primarily Puerto Rico.Murkoff said she couldn't fathom why Congress would not act speedily.""Family values should value families,"" she said in a dig at Republicans, especially those in the House who have passed only a third of the funding sought.""We've all seen the photos from Brazil of moms clutching babies with tiny heads and irreversibly damaged brains, and they tug at our hearts. But imagine for a moment that that was you, or that was your wife, or your daughter or your sister in that tragic picture,"" Murkoff said. ""Imagine that unspeakable pain, and now imagine not just one or two ... but imagine hundreds or thousands of moms and their babies suffering the same fate, the same devastating beginning, the same heartbreaking future, one that would almost certainly cost our economy exponentially more than full funding of a comprehensive bill would now.""Democrats at the event also argued that the $1.1 billion passed in last week's appropriations bill was not the starting point for negotiations, but the least that could be accepted. ""We can't go halfway, and underfund Zika,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). ""Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan like to talk about how they get things done. Well, a big part of getting things done is having both chambers work together, not just simply say, 'Oh we did something,' when no result occurs. Unfortunately it's clear when it comes to House Republicans and Senate Republicans, the right hand doesn't know what the far-right hand is doing.""","huffingtonpost","left","16946","zika",706
"Utibe Effiong, University of MichiganIn the last 40 years of mosquito-borne viruses such as malaria, yellow fever and dengue, scientists have introduced myriad interventions to control the population of mosquitoes. This is because controlling mosquitoes has a large effect on controlling the diseases since the mosquito is the vector that carries them.Novel mosquito-control approaches have included everything from deploying sterile male mosquitoes to soaps that could prevent people in high-risk malaria areas from contracting mosquito-borne diseases.Zika, the latest mosquito-borne virus to be declared a global health emergency, has once again propelled innovations to tackle the control of mosquitoes.There is talk of trying to stop Zika by giving mosquitoes a sexually transmitted disease and even injecting plants with a bacterium that would alter the mosquito's genome and eliminate its thirst for blood.Many of these innovations are good ideas but collectively they are only one of the tools in the armament of fighting mosquito-borne diseases. And they should not draw focus away from the tried and tested public health measures to control mosquito-borne diseases. These include environmental sanitation and access to clean water.Making male mosquitoes sterile was one of the first innovations introduced in the 1970s when malaria was considered a problematic disease. This was becase the malaria parasite had become resistant to front line drugs.Several other quick fixes have also been offered. These include fungi, worms and fish that parasitise and kill larval mosquitoes before they transform into adult mosquitoes. But these innovations were all found to be ineffective.Changing the genetic makeup of the mosquito has also been explored. It results in mosquitoes that are not susceptible to the parasite. But this approach is still many years from application in field settings.Having grown up on the banks of a heavily polluted canal in Nigeria and with limited access to potable water, the innovation that most fascinated me is a mosquito-repellent soap.Two African scientists created the soap from natural oils and plants. The hope was that it could successfully prevent mosquito-borne diseases because it is cheap to produce and relies on existing habits such as bathing, cleaning and doing laundry.But there is a catch. People need access to clean water to use the soap. Given that globally more than 700 million people still lack access to safe water, an innovation like a mosquito-repellent soap could become just another quick fix that only serves some but distracts from the complex task of providing more workable solutions.The use of mosquito-repellent soaps is in fact not a new idea. Natural insect repellents have been in use for millennia and soaps containing such ingredients have been available for at least 30 years.But natural mosquito-repellent soaps have been shown to have lower efficacy when compared to soaps containing the synthetic repellent DEET. More so, most of those natural ingredients could be harmful to health. Many of them cause cancer.Some of these innovations have worked on a small scale but are not as effective on a larger scale. And although the innovations focus on mosquito control, this is only one of many factors that result in the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.The reality is that there are many factors responsible for the persistence and global spread of mosquito-borne diseases. These are complex.They include:insecticide and drug resistance;changes in public health policies;emphasis on emergency response;demographic and societal changes; andgenetic changes in pathogens.Climate change is also implicated. Since insects have no internal control over their body temperature, as ambient temperatures rise their distribution may expand through increased reproductive rate, biting behaviour, and survival.Humidity and the availability of water for breeding in areas that are usually dry also promotes vector distribution and longevity. The incubation period of pathogens in vectors is temperature-dependent and becomes shorter in warmer conditions.Unprecedented population growth, mostly in developing countries, has resulted in major movements of people, primarily to urban centres. This unplanned and uncontrolled urbanisation has led to inadequate housing and deteriorating water, sewage, and waste-management systems. These produce ideal conditions for mosquito-borne diseases to be transmitted.My personal experiences and those of the hundreds of patients I treated for recurrent malaria in southern Nigeria are proof of this.So, what is the best way to prevent mosquito-borne diseases?The variation in malaria's epidemiology in and between countries shows that a multi-pronged approach is needed. This includes:providing and improving public health infrastructure;research to develop effective drugs and vaccines; andimproved vector control using proven techniques while taking up new innovations.Research has shown that mosquito control measures built around environmental management are non- toxic, cost-effective, sustainable and highly effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. Those environmental measures including standing water, vegetation and drainage management all rely on access to clean water and sanitation.The impact of adequate access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene go beyond mosquito control. They are essential for human survival. Access to these basic needs has a positive impact on the overall health, wealth and economic development of people and communities around the world.Improving access to water also goes a long way in preventing - and even eliminating - other water and sanitation-related diseases such as cholera, trachoma, schistosomiasis, worm infestations and guinea worm disease.UNICEF estimates that if countries in need were able to get basic, low-cost water and sanitation facilities, the world would save around US$263 billion a year. Those savings would come from obviated health and labour expenses.The threats that mosquito-borne diseases pose to global health are as real as the are complex. The response must be broad and calculated. It must apply proven interventions while trying out new ideas.Public health innovations should be considered as just one tool in our armament. They should not distract us, as they sometimes have, from the complex task of protecting and promoting global health through interventions like improving access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene.Utibe Effiong, Resident Physician at St Mary Mercy Hospital and Research Scientist for the Exposure Research Laboratory, University of MichiganThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

"ANALYSIS/OPINION:Disease, and how to deal with it, is the driving force of human history. It's all the more dreaded when its primary victims are children because without children there is no future. Though plagues and pandemics are largely scourges of the past, pestilence nevertheless persists. Zika, a virus transmitted to humans by a species of mosquito, was barely known by the public a month ago, but it has already been labeled ""a public health emergency of international concern"" by the World Health Organization (WHO). Fortunately, there's an effective solution on the shelf if the environmental ideologues will get out of the way of the lifesavers.DDT, which has saved millions of lives, not only in other lands but in the United States as well, was banned decades ago because environmentalists concluded that it harms birds, fish and certain other wildlife. Nothing developed since has matched DDT's ability to eradicate pests that threaten human lives. Prior to its prohibition, the pesticide had largely knocked out the mosquitoes that carry malaria, a disease often deadly in the tropics and in the Southern states. DDT was banished, but disease was not. Malaria has returned with a vengeance, killing 20 million persons since the ban. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported 627,000 deaths worldwide in 2012 alone.Rachael Carson effectively vilified DDT in her 1962 book, ""Silent Spring,"" stirring an ecological backlash and launching the environmentalist movement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned DDT in 1972 and other nations followed, except for limited use in Africa and Asia. But opposition may be weakening. ""Concern about DDT has to be reconsidered in the public health context,"" says Dr. Lyle R. Petersen, director of the division of vector-borne diseases at the CDC.The Zika virus, named for the Zika Forest in Uganda where it was first identified, produces only mild fever in adults, but scientists believe infected pregnant women can transmit it to the children they are carrying, resulting in microcephaly, a developmental malady causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads. Last week, the CDC further announced a link between the virus and Guillain-Barre, which can cause paralysis. The Zika virus was all but unknown in the West until it arrived in Mexico in 2015. Since then it has spread throughout Central and South America. More than 80 cases have been reported in the United States, all contracted abroad, and the WHO forecasts 3 to 4 million cases throughout the Americas over the next year. President Obama has asked Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funds to combat Zika.Some health officials argue that the spraying of pesticides is a throwback measure unworthy of the 21st century's commitment to ""sustainability,"" and advocate scientific trials of genetically modified mosquitoes whose offspring will die before maturity. Researchers are studying whether mosquito populations can be controlled by using radiation to sterilize males before they mate with female mosquitoes. Certain environmentalists even defend the lives of the infectious bugs, arguing that they play a valuable role in the natural order by making life miserable for humans establishing settlements in the rain forests.Radical environmentalists cling to their belief that DDT holds long-term risks for all living things. Millions of humans, many not yet born, could be saved by DDT. The EPA has saved millions of baby birds by sacrificing uncounted human babies by withholding the solution at hand. DDT should be enlisted in the struggle. Birds and fish are important, but children are, too. ","washingtontimes","right","16854","zika",573
"Senators said Thursday they're close to striking a deal to spend hundreds of millions of dollars fighting the Zika virus, as health officials' warnings and political pressure from Democrats have forced the GOP to the negotiating table.Bipartisan negotiators are working ""diligently"" to figure out how much the government needs to work on a vaccine and try to eradicate the mosquito that carries the virus, said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran.He was mum about the amount of spending, but Sen. Christopher Murphy, Connecticut Democrat, said the starting point appeared to be just over $1 billion, or more than half the $1.9 billion President Obama has said is needed.Senators are not eyeing offsets, meaning the money would be added onto the already-growing deficit.That's likely to be a sticking point with Republicans, who are already fighting for spending cuts elsewhere and who will look askance at any requests for new money.""We must resist the temptation just to treat every unusual expenditure as an emergency that can be not paid for,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, said Thursday.But Democrats are firm in saying they don't want to cut anything else to pay for the Zika money.""I certainly wouldn't support an offset,"" Mr. Murphy said. ""I think this is a classic emergency appropriation, and if we start fighting over offsets, it's just going to delay the resolution.""The White House has already shifted $510 million from the fight against Ebola in West Africa and $89 million from other accounts toward Zika, but Mr. Obama says much more is needed.Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, say he has refused to give them details on his plans, and they are reluctant to cut him a blank check - which they say has delayed the push to get more money out the door.""I believe we're closing in on a number that's the right number,"" said Sen. Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican who oversees the health subcommittee in charge of the request. ""There's never been a debate about whether to do this or not, but to be sure, we did it in the right way.""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 358 cases of travel-related Zika cases in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.It is spreading locally in Latin America and Puerto Rico but could swirl in the states once temperatures climb, allowing disease-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to multiply faster.""It's not like the mosquitoes are coming, the mosquitoes are already here,"" said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, Maryland Democrat. ""The mosquitoes are not going to wait for our motion to proceed, or to do our arrangements and so on.""The administration says the funds would be used to develop a better diagnostic test and a vaccine for Zika, which can cause babies to be born with abnormally small heads.It also wants to bolster mosquito-control efforts before the disease starts to spread on the U.S. mainland, while assisting other countries that are already dealing with the outbreak.Even if senators reach agreement, it is unclear if the package could pass the House, where the partisan divide is deep.GOP leaders there have resisted efforts to spend billions more on Zika, even as Democrats add more to their own wish list.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats will try to add hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Flint, Michigan, to any Zika bill.She also said they'll need to add money to the federal fight against the prescription opioids and heroin epidemic.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican, said he couldn't comment on the Senate's Zika package until it is finalized.""I reserve judgment until we see what it is they're up to,"" he said.Conservatives say they recognize the threat that Zika poses, however.""I do think we're going to need to do something about Zika - no question that it's going to inflict a lot of serious problems, particularly in the South,"" said Rep. John Fleming, Louisiana Republican, whose state could be among the hardest hit. ","washingtontimes","right","16912","zika",683
"California's San Mateo County reported a new case of Zika virus, confirmed publicly on Friday.The infected person became contracted the virus outside of the United States, and has since recovered according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Health officials stressed that there is no further risk of contracting the virus from the infected individual.Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitos are known to transmit Zika and have been found in the U.S. However, cases of Zika in the U.S. have been contracted while the infected individuals were either traveling abroad or due to sexual contact. Typically, the Zika-spreading mosquitos are most prevalent in Central and South American countries.In February of this year, Zika-spreading mosquitos were found infesting an area of Orange County, California. Those mosquitos were not found to be carrying the virus. As of that time, Zika-spreading mosquitos had been discovered in 12 of California's 58 counties.Just last week, the first California case of Zika spread by sexual transmission was reported in the state. The California Department of Public Health instructed:""If your partner has traveled to an area where Zika is present, protecting yourself by abstaining from sex or using condoms during sex is the best way to prevent sexual transmission of the Zika virus,"" said California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Director and State Public Health Officer Dr. Karen Smith. In that case the woman infected was not pregnant.In early March, health officials reported that the virus had reached the Bay Area. As in the San Mateo case, the announcement of the San Francisco case was made only after the patient had recovered. on Twitter  ","breitbart","right","16894","zika",277

"By now, just about everyone has heard of the Zika virus. The mosquito-borne illness found mostly in Central and Latin American countries has been shown to cause serious birth defects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have announced that the Zika virus is more dangerous than initially thought, and scientists predict that it could spread to the southern U.S.While most of the focus of the disease has been on how it's affecting pregnant women and infants, the elderly are also at risk, according to the CDC. If you're a senior or a caregiver for an elderly loved one, it's a good idea to learn more about the Zika virus so you know how best to protect against it.Risk FactorsThe main risk factor for contracting the Zika virus is travel to areas where the infected mosquitoes are. That includes parts of Central and South America (including Mexico), some Pacific Islands, and much of the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As of June 1, all of the 618 reported cases of the virus in the U.S. were travel-related.While most people who contract the Zika virus aren't even aware they have it because they don't show symptoms, common symptoms for adults include fever, body aches, rash and red eyes. How the Virus Affects Elderly PatientsAs with many illnesses, the elderly are at a disadvantage when it comes to the Zika virus since their immune systems are not as strong as they once were, making it tougher to fight off infections. ""The elderly are often more susceptible to many infections and more likely to experience severe symptoms. However, there have been no reports of this being the case with Zika,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a board-certified infectious disease specialist and assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.""It will be an important research question to determine if certain subgroups, including the elderly, are at higher risk for some of the more severe complications such as [paralysis disorder] Guillian-Barré syndrome,"" he said.Some unexplained cases that suggest the potential for more serious effects of the virus in adults include several dozen patients with Zika in French Polynesia who developed Guillain-Barré syndrome and two confirmed cases of Zika-infected adults in the U.S. who developed the disorder.In another case, an 81-year-old man in France tested positive for the virus after a trip to the Pacific Islands and later died of an inflammatory condition called meningoencephalitis. Prevention and Treatment""Although there is no definitive treatment for Zika, seniors who think they may have Zika should seek medical care because supportive care can decrease the length of illness and likelihood of death,"" said Dr. Kate Tulenko of IntraHealth International.Since there's no vaccine to prevent the Zika virus and no medicine developed to treat it, the best course of action is prevention. The CDC has issued travel alerts for the areas where the virus has spread. However, for seniors who must travel to those regions or in the event the virus spreads to the U.S., the next best thing is to avoid exposure to mosquitoes.Some recommended ways to do this include: Using mosquito repellant. Consumer Reports lists some top-rated options. Wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts Install window and door screens if your home does not already have them or use air conditioning rather than opening windows or doors If possible, stay indoors or in a screened-in building during daylight hours, especially mid-morning and early evening Avoid standing water, which tends to attract mosquitoes. (Swimming pools are ok because the chemicals used in the water also keep mosquitoes at bay).Additionally, men who are infected with the virus are able to transmit it through sexual contact, so condom use is another key way to prevent the spread of Zika.If an elderly loved one begins to show signs of the virus, make sure to help them get medical attention immediately.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency, has announced that the United States will not screen arriving travelers for the mosquito-borne Zika virus that is primarily afflicting Latin America and the Caribbean.Nevertheless, new arrivals who exhibit signs of illness are being ""referred to a secondary CBP inspection and may potentially be referred to CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for additional medical evaluation,"" revealed DHS in a statement.""Migrants who exhibit signs of illness when apprehended by CBP attempting to cross the border illegally are separated from healthy people to limit the potential spread of infection,"" it adds. ""Sick migrants are referred, transported, and escorted for appropriate medical attention as needed.""Moreover, pregnant women who are at risk of contracting Zika and have been taken into the custody by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a DHS wing, for violating the nation's immigration laws, are being provided special care.""Pregnant women in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody who originate from areas determined by CDC to have high incidence of Zika virus will be screened for symptoms of Zika virus by ICE medical providers, receive blood testing for Zika virus based on CDC guidance, and be provided prenatal care while in custody,"" noted DHS.In the United States, the efforts to respond to the Zika virus is being led by CDC component of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).Zika transmissions through blood transfusion and sexual contact have been confirmed. The virus has been linked to the neurological disorder known as microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and brains that may not have developed properly. Babies with microcephaly can also suffer from developmental problems and intellectual disabilities.Zika has also been associated with the rare Guillain-Barre syndrome, in which the body's immune system attacks part of the nervous system, causes weakness in the limbs and upper body and can even lead to total paralysis.President Obama is requesting more than $1.8 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds from Congress to combat the virus and address the U.S. government's response efforts.""Based on our current understanding of the virus, enhanced public health entry screening for Zika would not be effective because most people who are infected with Zika are asymptomatic and therefore could not be identified during the screening process,"" said DHS in a statement. ""Accordingly, CDC is not conducting, or recommending that CBP conduct, enhanced entry screening for Zika, such as active symptom monitoring and temperature checks at ports of entry for arriving travelers. CDC and CBP will continue to coordinate on appropriate measures.""Some health officials estimate that up to 80 percent of the people with Zika do not show any symptoms. Currently, there is no preventing drug or vaccine to combat the virus.Active Zika virus transmission cases have spread to 30 countries and territories, including 26 in the Americas, CDC reports.Although there have been travel-associated cases, no local mosquito-borne Zika virus cases have been identified in the continental United States, notes CDC, adding that such cases have been reported in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and America Samoa, all U.S. territories.""As part of standard operations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel observe all travelers entering the United States for general overt signs of illness at all U.S. ports of entry,"" explains DHS. ""This includes all federal inspection services areas at U.S. airports that service international flights, sea ports, and land border ports of entry. CBP officers also observe migrants for overt signs of illness when they are apprehended at U.S. borders while attempting to enter the United States unlawfully.""""We are deploying mosquito control measures at facilities housing individuals in DHS custody in the limited areas of the country where mosquitoes have transmitted the virus. Preparations are also underway in areas where mosquitoes of the same type are present, but where transmission is not known to have occurred,"" it later adds.DHS is also educating its workforce on the risks associated with Zika.""We have issued advisories to inform the DHS workforce about the virus and the risks associated with it, and are ensuring appropriate protective measures such as mosquito abatement are in place for DHS employees in affected areas in line with CDC guidance,"" points out DHS.""We are closely monitoring the Zika virus and its impact, and as we continue to learn more about the virus, the Department's actions and communications with the public and DHS workforce will continue to evolve in line with the overall Federal response,"" it continues.Some experts believe the Gulf Coast region of the United States, home to the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the Zika virus and poverty, is vulnerable to Zika virus transmissions.","breitbart","right","16845","zika",806
"The rapid spread of Zika virus through the Americas, together with the association of infection with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, have propelled this previously ignored virus into the limelight. What is this virus and where did it come from?Zika virus was first identified in 1947 in a sentinel monkey that was being used to monitor for the presence of yellow fever virus in the Zika Forest of Uganda. At this time, cell lines were not available for studying viruses, so serum from the febrile monkey was inoculated intracerebrally into mice. All the mice became sick, and the virus isolated from their brains was called Zika virus. The same virus was subsequently isolated from Aedes africanus mosquitoes in the Zika forest.Serological studies done in the 1950s showed that humans carried antibodies against Zika virus, and the virus was isolated from humans in Nigeria in 1968. Subsequent serological studies revealed evidence of infection in other African countries, including Uganda, Tanzania, Egypt, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone, and Gabon, as well as Asia (India, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia).Zika virus moved outside of Africa and Asia in 2007 and 2013 with outbreaks in Yap Island and French Polynesia, respectively. The first cases in the Americas were detected in Brazil in May 2015. The virus circulating in Brazil is an Asian genotype, possibly imported during the World Cup of 2014. As of this writing Zika virus has spread to 23 countries in the Americas.The virusZika virus is a member of the flavivirus family, which also includes yellow fever virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus. The genome is a ~10.8 kilobase, positive strand RNA enclosed in a capsid and surrounded by a membrane (illustrated; image copyright ASM Press, 2015). The envelope (E) glycoprotein, embedded in the membrane, allows attachment of the virus particle to the host cell receptor to initiate infection. As for other flaviviruses, antibodies against the E glycoprotein are likely important for protection against infection.Zika virus is transmitted among humans by mosquito bites. The virus has been found in various mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, including Aedes africanus, Aedes apicoargenteus, Aedes leuteocephalus, Aedes aegypti, Aedes vitattus, and Aedes furcifer. Aedes albopictus was identified as the primary vector for Zika virus transmission in the Gabon outbreak of 2007. Whether there are non-human reservoirs for Zika virus has not been established.Signs and SymptomsMost individuals infected with Zika virus experience mild or no symptoms. About 25 percent of infected people develop symptoms 2-10 days after infection, including rash, fever, joint pain, red eyes, and headache. Recovery is usually complete and fatalities are rare.Two conditions associated with Zika virus infection have made the outbreak potentially more serious. The first is development of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is progressive muscle weakness due to damage of the peripheral nervous system. The association of Guillain-Barré was first noted in French Polynesia during a 2013 outbreak.Congenital microcephaly has been associated with Zika virus infection in Brazil. While there are other causes of microcephaly, there has been a surge in the number of cases during the Zika virus outbreak in that country. Whether or not Zika virus infection is responsible for this birth defect is not known. One report has questioned the surge in microcephaly, suggesting that it is largely attributed to an 'awareness' effect.  Current epidemiological data are insufficient to prove a link of microcephaly with Zika virus infection. Needed are studies in which pregnant women are monitored to see if Zika virus infection leads to microcephaly.Given the serious nature of Guillain-Barré and microcephaly, it is prudent for pregnant women to either avoid travel to areas that are endemic for Zika virus infection, or to take measures to reduce exposure to mosquitoes.There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines that can be used to treat or prevent infection with Zika virus. We do have a safe and effective vaccine against another flavivirus, yellow fever virus. Substituting the gene encoding the yellow fever E glycoprotein with that from Zika virus might be a good approach to quickly making a Zika vaccine. However testing of such a vaccine candidate might require several years.Mosquito control is the only option for restricting Zika virus infection. Measures such as wearing clothes that cover much of the body, sleeping under a bed net, and making sure that breeding sites for mosquitoes (standing water in pots and used tires) are eliminated. Reducing mosquito populations with insecticides may also help to reduce the risk of infection.Closing thoughtsIt is not surprising that Zika virus has spread extensively throughout the Americas. This area not only harbors mosquito species that can transmit the virus, but there is little population immunity to infection. Infections are likely to continue in these areas, hence it is important to determine whether or not Zika virus infection has serious consequences.Recently Zika virus was identified in multiple states, including Texas, New York, and New Jersey, in international travelers returning to the U.S . Such isolations are likely to continue as long as infections occur elsewhere. Whether or not the virus becomes established in the U.S. is a matter of conjecture. West Nile virus, which is spread by culecine mosquitoes, entered the U.S. in 1999 and rapidly spread across the country. In contrast, Dengue virus, which is spread by Aedes mosquitoes, has not become endemic in the U.S.We recently discussed Zika virus on episode #368 of the science show This Week in Virology. You can be sure that we will revisit this topic very soon.This post originally appeared on Virology.ws.","huffingtonpost","left","16832","zika",945

"Pregnant TV anchor Savannah Guthrie took advantage of NBC Universal's decision not to require employees to attend the Olympics because of the Zika virus to announce on Tuesday that she will pass on the trip to Rio.The Hollywood Reporter described Guthrie as the ""most high profile TV personality"" to back out of the Rio games due to the mosquito-borne disease. For those who contract Zika, the illness is usually mild, with symptoms of fever, rash, and joint pain lasting for several days. Normally, the virus does not require hospitalization and rarely causes death. However, in the case of the virus infecting women during a pregnancy, Zika may cause microcephaly and other developmental problems for the offspring. Guthrie, 44, does not want to risk any complications for her second child in making the trip to South America.Guthrie, speaking on NBC's Today, stated: ""I'm not going to be able to go to Rio, so you'll have to go to beach volleyball without me."" The 44-year-old added, ""I'm looking forward to the campaign season.""Breitbart News reported on Monday that 2012 multiple Olympic gold medal winner Gabby Douglas offered an entirely different perspective on Zika.

"Paralympians in Australia expressed fear and concern over Zika mosquitos in Brazil during the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics.While most people can feel a mosquito bite, paralympians with nerve injuries do not notice the bite or the itch that follows. A brick wall fell and broke wheelchair champion Dani di Toro's spine when she was 14 years old. The injury resulted in a lack of feeling in her legs.""September (in Rio) is a whole different climate,"" said di Toro. ""It's about getting as much information as we can, work out some measures of what we need to do, then go and do those. For me, I'm absolutely thinking about that. I can cover myself up, stay inside as much as I can. It's just being smart about it.""The Paralympics begin on September 7. Brazilian officials have ordered health workers to sterilize Olympic stadiums on a daily basis during the events.Marathon champion Kurt Fearnley ""cannot use his legs, but he can feel them.""""I survived (the) Delhi (Commonwealth Games); crawled through the Kokoda jungle; been in Middle Eastern refugee camps, so I've been up against a few threats,"" he told The Australian. ""It's the wet season there (Brazil) now. As far as I understand, September is a whole new ball game.""Despite the name, the Olympics actually take place during winter in Brazil, so officials hope the cooler weather will kill the mosquitoes and lessen the threat of Zika. Spring formally begins in September.Dr. Art Caplan of the NYU Langone Medical Center is urging the government and Olympic committee to delay the games.""Are you really going to try to run the Olympics this August in the middle of a public health emergency when the country can't afford to finish the buildings, and has got to take on the mosquitos?"" he asked on SiriusXM POTUS's Michael Smerconish Show.The Australian Olympic Committee encouraged its female athletes to educate themselves about Zika and ""consider the risks of competing in the Rio Olympics due to the outbreak of Zika.""""Any team members who are pregnant at the time of the Games need to consider the risks very carefully before deciding whether to proceed with travel to Brazil,"" they said.Athletes will receive mosquito repellent from officials, who also recommend everyone wear long sleeves when possible.""The health and wellbeing of all our team members is paramount, especially those females in the team of child bearing age,"" declared Australian Olympic Team Chef de Mission Kitty Chillier. ""We have a responsibility to ensure that we educate and inform all prospective team members of the potential risks and to put in place whatever mitigating measures we can.""Patients often experience mild symptoms with Zika, but there have been cases linked to the rare Guillan-Barré Syndrome.""Guillain-Barré can be a nightmare for those who have it,"" Dr. Wellington Galvão, a hematologist in the city of Maceió in northeast Brazil, told the New York Times.

"Pregnant women in South and Latin America who contract Zika, a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne virus linked to severe birth defects and deformities in babies, should not have access to abortion, Republican House leaders said Wednesday. ""This push for more abortion access is heartbreaking, especially since there are different degrees of microcephaly,"" Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, said at a hearing about the virus. Microcephaly is a condition strongly linked to the Zika virus that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can lead to developmental problems, including seizures, cognitive delays, motor problems and hearing loss.Some countries where the Zika virus is spreading, including Brazil, El Salvador and Colombia, have recommended that women delay getting pregnant for up to two years. Those countries have some of the strictest abortion laws in the world, and it's difficult for poor women to get contraception. El Salvador, for instance, has no exceptions on its abortion ban and has even jailed women who have had miscarriages. In light of the epidemic, the United States Agency for International Development has recommended that the U.S. offer contraception and family planning services in Latin America to assist affected populations and keep the virus from spreading. Reproductive rights advocates are urging the endemic countries to loosen their abortion laws to accommodate pregnant women who contract Zika. House Democrats also emphasized the importance of increasing birth control access for women at the hearing on Wednesday, since the U.S. has longstanding prohibitions on foreign aid money being used to pay or advocate for abortion.""This isn't about abortion or not abortion,"" said Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.). ""It's about making sure those women who are not planning on pregnancy have the ability to not get pregnant until we know what we're dealing with.""House Republicans running the Zika virus hearing avoided the issue of contraception and family planning access for women in endemic countries and instead urged women to welcome babies born with microcephaly. Duncan acknowledged that ""many women do not have the luxury of simply choosing to wait"" to get pregnant, but added that abortion access is not the answer, because many babies born with microcephaly ""go on to lead very normal lives."" ""Each child is made in the image of God and has inherent worth,"" he said.Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) said the U.S. needs to work harder to ""ensure that any child born with with disabilities from this or any other infection is welcomed, loved and gets the care that he or she needs.""

"The mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics, insisted that the spread of the mosquito-borne Zika virus ""is not a big issue"" days after Brazilian researchers warned the disease has mutated into something ""more dangerous.""Less than a week after NBC News reported the Brazilian researchers' findings, Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes told Sky News that visitors to the Olympic games this summer need not worry.Paes' comments, reported on May 16, also came despite the warnings from prominent Canadian public health professor Amir Attaran, who wrote in the Harvard Public Health Review last week that moving ahead with the Games would pose ""a foreseeable global catastrophe.""""There's not many cases of the Zika virus, especially in the city of Rio,"" claimed the mayor.However, Brazilian government statistics released in late April revealed that the country had documented a staggering 91,387 Zika cases in 2016 alone, less than 1oo days from the start of the Olympics, with more than 7,000 of them linked to pregnant women.At the time, Rio de Janeiro led the number of recorded Zika cases with 25,930. Brazil remains the most Zika-affected country.Nevertheless, Rio Mayor Paes declared, ""There is the issue with pregnant women and this is something we need to take care of, but I don't know anyone who's got the Zika virus, and I know a lot of people, so this is not a big issue.""""Dengue fever, which we have in the summer time every year, is much worse than the Zika virus and nobody talks about Dengue fever,"" he also said. ""It is weird for us when we listen to the news outside. Sometimes I think people think it's like Ebola. You've got to come and enjoy.""The mayor alleged worries about the Olympics in Brazil are no different than in previous host cities.""I remember when I got into London two or three days before the games, the newspapers were saying it was going to be chaos, terrible, everything is going to go wrong,"" he told Sky News.""Things will all go well and the Zika virus is not going to be a big issue,"" he declared.On May 11, NBC News reported that a study by Brazilian researchers published in the journal Nature ""found evidence it may have evolved into a new form that's more likely to damage brain cells and cause birth defects.""""Much more research needs to be done to prove this - but the findings mesh with other findings that show mutations that make the Zika strain now circulating in Latin America and the South Pacific are different from older strains first seen in Africa in the 1940s and 1950s,"" notes the news outlet.Zika has been linked to the neurological disorder known as microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads, and Guillain-Barre, a rare syndrome that causes the immune system to damage nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis.""Our findings support the hypothesis that microcephaly is a distinctive feature of recent Zika virus Asian-lineage virus, which originated in the Pacific and is now spreading in South and Central America,"" Patricia Beltrão-Braga of the University of Sao Paulo and colleagues wrote in the journal Nature.However, the International Olympic Committee has refused to make any changes to the scheduled games.Zika has spread across the world, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a public health emergency, with concerns that the virus can lead to birth defects among pregnant women.The virus has been reported in 47 countries and territories, with Brazil being the country with the most Zika-linked microcephaly cases.More than two billion people worldwide are at risk of contracting the Zika virus, according to a study recently published in eLife, a medical journal.Breitbart News reported:Zika can be contracted from an Aedes aegypti mosquito bite, a carrier, or transmission through sexual contact with a person carrying the virus, according to scientists.""Australian pharmaceutical company Starpharma Holdings Ltd said it is teaming up with world No. 2 condom maker Ansell Ltd to supply Zika virus-proof condoms to the Australian Olympic team ahead of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games,"" reports Reuters.""Starpharma said it is giving the Australian athletes Ansell 'Dual Protect' condoms lubricated with Starpharma's VivaGel product, which it recently said showed near-total antiviral protection against Zika and other viruses in laboratory studies,"" it added.","breitbart","right","16938","zika",742
"Yesterday, the House voted on the Zika Vector Control Act.Did House Republicans suddenly decide that they care about investing in public health measures to combat the Zika virus? Of course not.They just rebranded an old bill (the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2014) designed to deregulate pesticide use:Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2014 which failed the House under suspension of the Rules on July 28, 2014.  That vote can be found here.  House Republicans then put the bill back on the Floor under a Rule on July 31, 2014 and it received even fewer Democratic votes.  That vote can be found here.  The underlying legislation would not help to contain the spread of Zika virus in any way; instead the bill would exempt pesticide spraying near bodies of water from regulation under an existing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) general Clean Water Act permit through September 30, 2018. Nearly 2000 U.S. waterways are contaminated with pesticides, and H.R. 897 would worsen the problem. The existing Clean Water Act permit in no way hinders, delays, or prevents the use of approved pesticides for mosquito control in emergency situations. In fact, the permit provides a specific emergency provision to prevent outbreaks of disease, such as the Zika virus. Under the terms of the permit, pesticide applicators are covered automatically under the permit and any spraying may be performed immediately for any declared pest emergency situations. Instead of trying to deceive the American people by appearing to address the Zika virus while only hurting the environment, House Republicans should take action to provide sufficient emergency supplemental funding to combat the Zika virus and work with Democrats to keep Americans healthy and safe.The vote was 262 to 159.

"People traveling to Central America and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean, should take special precautions against mosquito bites because of an outbreak of Zika virus, a previously rare disease that may be linked to serious birth defects. Pregnant women should consider avoiding the region, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised.The CDC on Friday issued a ""Level 2"" travel notice for Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela and Puerto Rico, as well as the Caribbean islands Haiti and Martinique. A Level 2 notice means that Americans should ""practice enhanced precautions"" while on their trip and that, in this case, pregnant women should consider not going. Zika may be linked to microcephaly, a serious birth defect in which a baby is born with an abnormally small head and possible developmental problems. That's why the travel alert advises pregnant women to consider postponing their trip, or at least talking to their doctor about risks and taking strict measures to avoid mosquito bites. Women who are considering becoming pregnant also were advised to consult with health care providers before traveling and to follow anti-bite measures. These steps include wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants and using insect repellants with active ingredients like DEET, picaridin, and IR3535 (which the CDC said are safe for pregnant women, nursing women and babies older than 2 months). Additionally, travelers are ""strongly urged"" to treat their clothing and gear with a repellant called permethrin and sleep in rooms with screens and air conditioning, according to the CDC.  There's no known vaccine or treatment.Zika is related to dengue fever, another mosquito-borne disease. They're both transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Zika also may be transmitted by Aedes albopictus. Zika was first discovered in 1947, but because it was so rare and its symptoms are usually mild -- fever, joint pain and rash -- the disease wasn't considered much of a threat.But in 2015, Brazil experienced a widespread outbreak, with perhaps as many as 1.3 million cases, which coincided with a sharp increase in babies born with microcephaly, which can cause lifelong intellectual disability, seizures and other complications.Between 2010 and 2014, Brazil had an average of 156 babies born each year with microcephaly. In 2015, that number exceeded 3,000. Because the increase was so pronounced, Brazilian health authorities linked the birth defects to Zika. Health experts in other countries, including the CDC, agree the evidence is strong, but the relationship isn't confirmed yet. ","huffingtonpost","left","16815","zika",428
"May 18 The Zika virus, an infectious disease linked to severe birth defects in babies, may spread into Europe as the weather gets warmer, although the risk is low, health officials said on Wednesday.In its first assessment of the threat Zika poses to the region, the World Health Organization's European office said the overall risk was small to moderate. It is highest in areas where Aedes mosquitoes thrive, in particular on the island of Madeira and the north-eastern coast of the Black Sea.""There is a risk of spread of Zika virus disease in the European Region and ... this risk varies from country to country, said Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO's regional director for Europe.""We call particularly on countries at higher risk to strengthen their national capacities and prioritize the activities that will prevent a large Zika outbreak.""The WHO's European region covers 53 countries and a population of nearly 900 million. It stretches from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south and from the Atlantic in the west to the Pacific in the east.A large and spreading outbreak of Zika that began in Brazil has caused global alarm. The virus has been linked to thousands of cases of a birth defect known as microcephaly in babies of women who become infected with Zika while pregnant.The WHO has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults.The WHO's Geneva headquarters in February declared the Zika outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), warning it was spreading ""explosively"" in the Americas.The WHO's European office said that if no measures are taken to mitigate the threat, the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that can carry the virus mean the likelihood of local Zika transmission is moderate in 18 countries in the region.A further 36 countries have low, very low or no likelihood, the assessment found. Aedes mosquitoes are not found in those countries and their climates would not be suitable for the mosquitoes to establish themselves.Countries with high and moderate risk of Zika should improve vector-control measures to prevent the spread of mosquitoes and reduce their density, WHO Europe said. They also should equip health workers to detect cases early, report them swiftly, and help people at risk - notably pregnant women - protect themselves from infection, it said.The WHO's European risk analysis took in multiple factors, among them the presence of Zika-transmitting mosquitoes, suitable climates for the mosquito, previous history of transmission of dengue or chikungunya, ship and flight connections, and population density and urbanization.It also considered the capacity of the country to contain transmission at an early stage, based on four main factors: vector control, clinical surveillance, laboratory capacity and emergency risk communications.The WHO's regional office is convening a meeting of European health experts in Portugal from June 22-24 to discuss the Zika threat further.(Reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Larry King)","huffingtonpost","left","16939","zika",526

So if you have plans to fly to the Caribbean or Central or South America in the coming month, you may be wondering what to do. In short, you'll want to follow these steps.Most domestic carriers--including Delta, American, and United--are making provisions for concerned travelers. (Find more details about what airlines are doing in our guide to zika virus facts, right here.) Either way, expect red tape: American Airlines, for instance, is only offering cancellations to certain destinations on the CDC watch list, and Delta has a cutoff of February 29 for fee-free itinerary changes. For that reason, talking to a human is the way to go.RELATED: 19 Locations From Your Favorite TV Shows You Can Visit in Real LifeWhereas airlines are enforcing policies company-wide, hotels and operators are largely acting on a case-by-case basis. Some properties outside of the CDC warning destinations are issuing rebooking policies; others inside the alert zones are not. Unfortunately, because the CDC alert is a recommendation rather than a government mandate, they aren't required to offer refunds or cancellation support.Since they have strong relationships with hotels and operators, they may be able to negotiate on your behalf. Even then, agents have been reporting that many clients are still coughing up thousands to cancel their travel plans.Cancel for any reason policies aren't the most commonly chosen among travelers, but if you have one, you'll be in luck. If you're considering taking out a new policy, ask about this style of coverage and triple check (again, with an agent over the phone) that ""change of mind"" is an acceptable reason to cancel your trip. If it is, you can generally get refunded up to 75 percent of your travel costs.RELATED: The Cheapest Places to travel for Each Month of the YearPhil Sylvester, Chief Content and Communications Manager at World Nomads, a top travel insurance provider, offered more solutions. ""Regardless of Zika, if a pregnant woman becomes ill prior to departure and is declared medically unfit to travel, they are covered for cancellation costs,"" he said. Sylvester also clarified that unless there's a government declaration against travel to specific destinations--one that can't be interpreted as a mere suggestion--travel insurance likely won't offer you a bail out.More from Travel + Leisure:World's Best Airlines for In-Flight ServiceWorld's Worst Airlines for In-Flight ServiceBest Places to Travel in 2016","huffingtonpost","left","16832","zika",465
"The news is full of the Zika virus, which is understandable as we await the outcomes of the potential spread of that virus. I hope that we are able to find a prevention strategy for this virus soon. I do find myself wondering, however, why we spend so much time talking about the Zika virus, which thus far has only impacted a handful of pregnancies in this country, yet our airwaves are silent on the topic of another virus that causes 1 in 750 American children to be born with or develop permanent problems due to the virus.  That virus is CMV or Cytomegalovirus. Every hour, one child is permanently disabled by CMV. As a nurse with most of my career spent in obstetrics and pediatrics and also as the mother of three beautiful children, I think that I had begun to imagine that I knew most conditions that could impact a pregnancy and infancy. Currently, as a public health nurse who educates high-risk pregnant clients and mothers of young children, I certainly felt well-informed about pregnancy health. However, the pregnancy of a co-worker -- a nurse herself, made me rethink my knowledge of pregnancy health altogether. Image courtesy of The National CMV Foundation. My co-worker Amanda was in the middle of a planned second pregnancy, with a healthy 2-year-old and a supportive husband at home. At her 20-week ultrasound, however (a turning point for many pregnant mothers at the halfway mark of pregnancy and a time when many learn the gender of their baby) the results of the pregnancy were abnormal with the cerebellum (the part of the brain that coordinates muscle activity) measuring three weeks behind. They were sent to a the perinatologist the next day who performed an amniocintesis. The family endured 10 days of fear in wait of the results, which came back as CMV, also known as Cytomegalovirus. Only 9% of women know about CMV. According to the CDC, 1 in 150 children is born with a congenital(present at birth) CMV infection. And yet, it is a virus that many of us have never heard of -- even as Zika rages through our media and has become a diagnosis that most of us are very familiar with. Graphic courtesy of The National CMV Foundation. What Amanda and her family were now facing is a virus that impacts families around the world every day -- a virus that many of us have no knowledge of.  Amanda, like me, did not recall ever hearing of the virus other than a vague recollection of a brief education in nursing school years ago. The family now had a printout from the CDC in their hands from the doctor and a world of education about the virus to seek out. They were offered the options of an abortion or they could ""wait and see."" The doctor reported that there were no treatments of CMV in pregnancy. The impacts of CMV on the infant can range from very mild to severe and there was no guarantee on which end of the spectrum their baby would be. 400 children die from CMV every year. The family went home and did their research, discovering that the University of Minnesota offered a treatment during pregnancy with immunoglobulin, something that is done more frequently in Europe and a treatment that their doctor had not been aware of. The cost was over $80,000 US and was covered by insurance. They would do 4 treatments during the pregnancy. After the fourth treatment, Amanda realized that her baby was not moving as much as normal. They did a biophysical profile (a test that measures the health of the fetus during pregnancy) and it was determined that they should deliver her early at 34 weeks. This early birth was not due to CMV but a true knot in her cord (and is a helpful reminder to all expecting mamas in their third trimester to count the kicks). Pippa during her NICU stay.Sweet Pippa was born and she spent three weeks in the NICU due to her early birth. She tested positive for CMV in her blood, urine and saliva at birth and also failed her newborn hearing screening. She began an antiviral treatment (Valcyte) which has been shown to improve hearing and neurodevelopmental outcomes, a treatment which she took for six months and tolerated well. 90% of babies born with CMV will appear healthy at birth. At six months old, her parents noticed that she was not developing typically. Pippa had an MRI and it showed polymicrogyria (a condition characterized by abnormal development of the brain before birth) in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Pippa is now 8 months old. She is just now starting to roll over(a four month-old developmental skill) and she does not make many sounds. Her family take her to physical therapy weekly and occupational therapy every other week. Her life is punctuated by doctor and specialist visits and her parents are told that she will likely have difficulty with speech and language and possibly cognitive issues. She will need physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and maybe special education. Her future is unknown as issues can arise many years into a child's life.  Paul, Amanda, Atticus and Pippa today. I asked Amanda what her family wanted people to know about CMV. She wants everyone to know that it is common, preventable and treatable. OB doctors in this country are not routinely educating soon-to-be parents about the disease but everyone has a right to know how to prevent transmission of the virus during pregnancy. CMV is more common than all of the newborn screening disorders COMBINED. Yes, combined. And, yet we still are not having a conversation about this virus that has an impact on so many on a daily basis. They also want other families that are dealing with the complications of CMV to know that they are not alone. During her tough moments, Amanda often goes to the Facebook page of the National CMV Foundation to read the stories of other beautiful children like Pippa and their families that rally around them each day. She also hopes that families dealing with a new CMV diagnosis would see if the antiviral therapy that was right for Pippa may be right for their child as well. PippaToday Pippa is a happy baby that brings joy to her family every day. Her family sometimes wonders what life may have been like for Pippa if they had known about CMV before the pregnancy and were able to prevent the consequences of this virus. They also are often reminded that Pippa could have been one of the 400 that die each year from CMV and this fact makes them hold her a little closer in gratitude that she is here. If you are considering becoming pregnant or are currently pregnant, we ask that you go to the National CMV Foundation for more information and to start a conversation with your OB about CMV prevention. You can be tested for CMV prior to pregnancy and can take steps during pregnancy to prevent transmission(most likely from a young child) to you and the baby.  My hope and the hope of Pippa's family is that we will someday have a world where this common,preventable and treatable virus is no longer negatively impacting pregnancies and children. That dream can only happen when we begin to talk about CMV and ensure that every family has the information that they need to prevent the detrimental impact of this virus. Together, we can make that happen. This article was originally published on The Zen RN.","huffingtonpost","left","16972","zika",1294
"The Zika virus, linked to babies with tiny brains, has the same mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, (range in dark green) as the chikungunya virus which has already spread into Florida.  A five fold jump in microcephaly has been seen since the Zika outbreak began in Brazil.Since this May, when the first reports of cases of the Zika virus were seen in Brazil at least half a million people have been infected. For most people the symptoms are relatively mild, rashes, joint pain and low grade fever. However, since the outbreak began public health officials have reported 2782 cases of infant microcephaly. Microcephaly is a condition where a baby has a tiny head associated with incomplete brain development.  The occurrence rate is five times higher than it was before May.Scientists haven't yet firmly established that Zika has caused microcephaly but they are building solid evidence.  Brazilian officials officially reported a link between Zika and microencepahly after Zika Virus was found on autopsy in the tissues of the brain of the baby of an infected mother. How Zika might cause microcephaly is unknown, but expectant parents in Brazil are near panic.In 33 years of practice, Rio de Janeiro obstetrician and gynecologist Isabella Tartari Proenca has helped countless expectant mothers through the anxieties of pregnancy and childbirth. But ever since an exotic virus called Zika hit Brazil a few months ago, she's run out of assurances. ""I get calls and text messages all day long,"" Tartari told me. ""My patients are terrified.""Who could blame them? Since May, when the national health ministry confirmed the first cases of Zika virus, the mosquito-borne disease has swept the country, infecting at least half a million people. While most victims escape with a low-grade fever, skin rashes and achy joints, some dire complications have ensued. Suspected to be among them is microcephaly, a condition that leads to exceptionally small infant head size, which causes lasting neurological damage and can lead to death.Zika is a disease that was first seen in Uganda in 1940. It became endemic to Africa and recently spread to the south Pacific. Since reaching South America, apparently from the south Pacific or Asia, it has spread rapidly because the mosquito that carries the virus, Aedes aegypti, is well adapted to cities and warm humid tropical and subtropical environments. The natural range of this mosquito includes the southern United States. Chikungunya, a virus that also arose in Africa spread by Aedes aegypti, recently reached Florida from the Caribbean. Chikungunya has proven to be less of a problem in the U.S. than feared but Zika has the same vector.Yellow fever epidemics once reached the southern U.S. through this mosquito vector. Successful campaigns reduced the vector and yellow fever epidemics ended in the south. The success against yellow fever led to reduced efforts to control mosquitoes. Now Aedes aegypti is back. Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito, is back in the southern U.S. It's the vector for Zika virus.The combination of climate change, human populations expanding into African jungles, and modern human mobility is expanding the ranges of viruses once limited to Africa. Morevoer, as the climate warms, mosquitoes that once lived only near the Gulf of Mexico may expand into the swamps of east coast's coastal plain and up the Mississippi river valley,Now that Zika has reached south America it could follow a similar path to Florida and the Gulf Coast states as the chikungunya virus which spread from Africa to the Caribbean to Florida. Both viruses originated in Africa and have found their way to the new world by means of modern travel. The viruses share the vector Aedes aegypti. There is no vaccine or cure for either virus at this time. If the Aedes aegypti mosquito is established in an area there may be no way to stop outbreaks of either virus. Our luck keeping out chikununya virus ran out in 2014. Our luck in keeping out Zika will run out soon if we don't control Aedes aegypti. (Please note that this conclusion is mine alone. I am not aware of any reports about the spread of Zika virus to the United States. This is an original analysis made by the author of this post.)A second surprise came in 2013 when chikungunya showed up on the sun-splashed Caribbean island of Saint Martin. A traveler - from the Far East according to genetic characteristics of the virus - apparently arrived in Saint Martin carrying the virus and was bitten by a local mosquito, which then spread it to other people, says Ann Powers, a molecular virologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort Collins, Colo. This launched the epidemic in the West.""Our luck ran out,"" Weaver says. In the ensuing year and a half, chikungunya established a foothold in the Americas that it may never relinquish. Florida had 11 cases in 2014 transmitted by local mosquitoes. The warm Gulf Coast may be at risk since the tropical Ae. aegypti,which appears to be driving the epidemic, can live there, says Higgs.And the summer Olympics are coming to Brazil in 2016.","dailykos","left","16797","zika",852
"President Barack Obama attempted to allay fears about the mosquito-borne Zika virus in an interview aired Monday, reminding people that the virus is not deadly.""The good news is, this is not like Ebola,"" he told CBS News' Gayle King before the Super Bowl on Sunday. ""People don't die of Zika, people get it and they don't know they have it.""The virus is a serious issue, he noted, for pregnant women. ""There appears to be some significant risk for pregnant women or women who are thinking about getting pregnant,"" he said.Zika has been linked to birth defects, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised that pregnant women consider postponing travel to places where there is an active outbreak.Adding to concern, the CDC also announced last week that the first-ever transmission of Zika in the U.S. resulted from sexual contact. New interim federal guidelines now mandate that pregnant couples in which a male partner may have been exposed to Zika should use condoms during vaginal, anal and oral sex or practice abstinence.Obama told King that his administration is submitting a proposal to Congress that will dedicate resources to vaccine research and strengthening public health systems.""But there shouldn't be panic on this. This is not something where people are going to die from it,"" he said. ","huffingtonpost","left","16839","zika",251
"The Zika virus has reached Canada in the form of four Canadian travelers confirmed to have contracted it by visiting Central America, South America, and the Caribbean.The announcement came from Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Gregory Taylor, on Friday. CBC News reports two of the cases are in British Columbia, one in Alberta, and one in Quebec.According to Quebec's public health director, the case in his region involves a woman who was not pregnant, but showed some Zika symptoms before recovering. The symptoms in adults are relatively mild - including fever, rash, pink-eye, or joint and muscle pain for a few days - and even those symptoms only manifest in 20 to 25 percent of patients.However, some adult patients have reported far more severe reactions to the virus, and there is a suspected correlation between Zika and birth defects, including paralysis and microcephaly.CBC reported the growing Zika panic did not seem to be changing the travel plans of many Canadians. The recent weakness of the Canadian dollar in the U.S. prompted many vacationers to choose Caribbean destinations instead, and travel agents report few cancellations since news of the Zika virus began spreading.""People are just wanting to be more informed about it, but they're not backing away from going away, or cancelling,"" Mary Jane Hiebert of the Canada One Travel agency told CBC, describing a lone cancellation from a woman who discovered she was pregnant after booking a trip to the Caribbean. Several vacation companies said they would offer cancellation or reschedule options for pregnant women but have reported few takers so far.An important factor in Canadians' reaction to the Zika outbreak mentioned by CBC is that Brazil and Costa Rica, at the center of the epidemic, are not popular travel destinations for Canadians. They prefer Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba. Also, winter travelers have confidence in the ability of the resorts they prefer to control mosquito populations, which are the transmission system for Zika.The Canadian government has, however, joined the United States in issuing a travel warning for the outbreak area, recommending that ""pregnant women and those considering becoming pregnant discuss their travel plans with their health care provider to assess their risk and consider postponing travel to areas where the Zika virus is circulating in the Americas.""Those who insist on traveling to the Caribbean are encouraged by the Public Health Agency of Canada to follow ""strict mosquito bite prevention measures,"" and reminded there is not yet a ""vaccine or medication that protects against Zika virus infection.""","breitbart","right","16832","zika",425

""is allowing his party to undermine the ability of family planning providers like Planned Parenthood to do what we do best in the midst of this rapidly spreading Zika virus, a public health crisis that directly targets women and children. This is shameful.""The Senate has three days this week, following the July 4 break, to pass the measure that would fund anti-Zika efforts. Otherwise, the issue will not be addressed until September, after the summer recess.As Breitbart News has reported, Planned Parenthood has been taking advantage of fears surrounding the Zika virus and the birth defect known as microcephaly that is linked with the virus.

""Half a billion taxpayer dollars annually already flow to Planned Parenthood, which runs the nations largest chain of abortion centers.""Ferguson adds:As Roll Call reports, President Barack Obama - a big supporter of Planned Parenthood - demanded Congress delay its summer recess in order to pass his $1.9 billion proposal to fight the Zika virus.""This is actually something that we could reduce the risks if Congress does the right thing and allocates the dollars that are needed right now to get it done,"" Obama said. ""The problem right now is the money is stuck in Congress and we have not seen the House and the Senate come together in a sensible [way] to put forward the dollars that we have requested  to get the job done.

"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its diagnostic testing guidelines for the Zika virus on Tuesday, based on early data showing that it can be found at higher levels or last longer in urine than in blood.The agency now recommends that its preferred diagnostic test, called Zika virus RT-PCR, be conducted on urine collected less than 14 days after the individual suspected of having the disease starts experiencing symptoms. (1.usa.gov/27bd489)The test should be performed in conjunction with blood testing if the specimens are collected less than seven days after the onset of symptoms, the CDC said.A positive result in either case provides adequate evidence of infection, the agency said.The CDC recommendations for Zika testing though blood and other procedures remain unchanged.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Zika outbreak an international health emergency on Feb. 1.The outbreak is affecting large parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, with Brazil the hardest hit so far.U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.

"As the research community gears up to address Zika virus, one common question has been why, if we've known about Zika since 1947, are we only starting these efforts in 2016?As Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted, the disease is uncharted territory.""We, prior to this time, have really not spent anything on Zika,"" he said during a press conference Thursday. Currently, there is no cure and no vaccine for the disease, and diagnosing the disease takes up to two weeks in specialized labs. To ramp up research on the Zika virus threat, the NIAID, the arm of the National Institutes of Health that conducts and supports research on infectious diseases, is now alerting the research community in the U.S. that they are interested in funding Zika research -- from diagnostic tools, treatments and vaccines to basic research on how the virus works and the biology of the mosquito that carries it.For the approximately 4,000 Brazilian babies born in the last four months with microcephaly -- the birth defect that may be linked to Zika virus -- these efforts may seem to be too little, too late.But there is a good reason for this lack of research: Zika was not considered a serious health threat until 2013, when a large outbreak in French Polynesia coincided with a 20-fold increase there in the neurological disorder Guillian-Barre syndrome. The connection between the virus and the disorder is still being confirmed.Then, in 2015, Brazil experienced the widest outbreak of Zika virus to date, and up to 1.5 million people contracted the virus. Only then did scientists begin to connect the mild, mostly symptomless mosquito-borne disease to debilitating birth defects.Zika virus' symptoms -- fever, conjunctivitis, joint pain and rash -- are short-lived, mild, and pale in comparison to its mosquito-borne brother, dengue or ""breakbone"" fever. Most people who contract Zika virus don't even know that they have it, as only one in five become sick.  And similar to the Ebola virus, which until 2014 had only infected less than 2,000 people over 50 years, there's no good way to test a vaccine to see if it works on any virus until it infects a large swath of the population.""Zika virus was this obscure disease in parts of Africa and South Pacific, and it wasn't a priority on anyone's radar screen,"" said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""Now with the clear evidence of microcephaly, this is a big deal.""Taking all this into context, Osterholm said it makes sense that global health researchers would prioritize other, more wide-ranging diseases than Zika.""I could argue, why don't we have better flu vaccines? Why don't we have better pertussis vaccines?"" said Osterholm. ""We need a vaccine against AIDS; we need a vaccine against malaria that's effective.""Luckily, the NIAID has already spent nearly $100 million on researching flaviviruses, the family of viruses that includes Zika, along with West Nile, dengue and yellow fever. Because these viruses are closely related, previous work on West Nile and dengue vaccines could prove to be a platform for an eventual Zika virus vaccine, he said. A vaccine for West Nile virus successfully produced neutralizing antibodies to the disease in healthy adults in a 2011 clinical trial. Fauci said researchers may be able to substitute the West Nile virus gene for the Zika virus gene in the same vaccine. If that is successful, the vaccine could be tested in a small group of people by the end of 2016. However, he warned that it would be a while before a safe, effective Zika virus vaccine became widely available.""While these approaches are promising, it is important to understand that we will not have a widely available safe and effective vaccine this year and probably not even in the next few years,"" he said.","huffingtonpost","left","16829","zika",741
"Three babies born in the U.S. had birth defects that can be traced to the Zika virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its first-ever update on how the disease is affecting pregnancy outcomes.The CDC also recorded three instances of pregnancy loss - such as miscarriages or abortion - in which the fetus had birth defects.The new data is an outgrowth of Zika-related pregnancy figures the CDC began to compile earlier this year.So far, 234 pregnant women in the states and D.C. and 189 in the U.S. territories have shown lab evidence of the mosquito-borne illness, which is causing some babies of infected mothers to be born with abnormally small heads or other problems.CDC is reporting pregnancy cases weekly, and Thursday's report marked the first time it documented instances of birth defects.The CDC is not linking each case to specific states because of privacy concerns.However, there have been two widely known cases of microcephaly in U.S.-born infants - one to a mother who lived in Brazil before giving birth in Hawaii, and one to a Honduran women who gave birth at a northern New Jersey hospital in late May.The CDC has recorded more than 750 travel-related cases of Zika in the 50 states and D.C. overall, a handful of them through sexual transmission, though experts say the virus could puncture the mainland further once mosquito season ramps up. ","washingtontimes","right","16968","zika",237
"Some U.S. national pro-life groups are denouncing the left's promotion of abortion as a solution to the Zika virus pandemic that is spreading throughout the Americas.""It is shameful that the abortion industry is trying to capitalize on a health crisis by pushing abortion rather than addressing the actual cause of a real problem,"" said Americans United for Life President and CEO Dr. Charmaine Yoest in a statement to Breitbart News.Yoest continued:As Breitbart News reported January 29, Planned Parenthood has taken advantage of fears surrounding the Zika crisis in Brazil to promote the expansion of unrestricted abortion throughout Latin America. The abortion business has especially targeted those Latin American countries with restrictive abortion laws, such as El Salvador, in hopes of using the crisis to ease existing abortion legislation.As Breitbart News also previously reported, sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy echoed the perspective associated with United Nations groups - which view abortion as a human right - when she wrote in an editorial, ""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not.""Similarly, in an editorial published by online news outlet El Faro, which covers Latin America, Laura Aguirre, a sociology doctoral student at the Institute of Latin American Studies at the Free University of Berlin, condemned the suggestion by the government of El Salvador that women abstain from getting pregnant until 2017. ""Don't be ridiculous,"" she says in her headline, of the suggesting that avoiding pregnancy will limit damage to an unborn child. Aguirre suggests instead that women in El Salvador be granted access to abortion instead.Zika was first discovered in 1947 in an ape. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first human case of the virus was recorded in 1968. Though ignored for many years, its possible ties to microcephaly - a birth defect that causes babies to be born with smaller heads than normal and to often have developmental problems - have now captured the attention of world health officials.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned pregnant American women and females of childbearing age who may become pregnant against traveling to most countries in the Americas where the Zika virus has spread.On Tuesday, the Israeli Health Ministry also advised women visiting countries afflicted with the Zika virus to refrain from becoming pregnant while there and until they are out of those countries for a four-week period.Canada has reported four Zika cases in travelers to Latin America. In the United States, California health officials say six people who were infected with the virus abroad have been diagnosed since 2013.Dallas County, Texas health officials have also confirmed its first sexually transmitted case of the Zika virus.""Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,"" said Zachary Thompson, Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) director. ""Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any sexually-transmitted infections.""Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) - the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List - tells Breitbart News the Zika pandemic and its use by the left to promote abortion is an urgent topic.""The Charlotte Lozier Institute joins public health officials in expressing great concern over the spread of the Zika virus,"" Donovan said in a statement to Breitbart News. ""We support the expansion of public health measures to check and ultimately eradicate this mosquito-borne disease and to identify and assist potentially infected individuals.""""As we monitor scientific and policy developments regarding this new threat, we must hold in mind the overarching responsibility of medicine to respect the sanctity of every human life, including the vulnerable unborn,"" he added.","breitbart","right","16834","zika",649
"WASHINGTON -- The threat posed by the spreading Zika virus has been alarming health officials across the Americas since last year. Republicans in Congress on Wednesday finally started show signs they were getting concerned. At least, some of them.Emerging from a weekly meeting with fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives, several members said House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) mentioned that a top priority was dealing with the virus that causes birth defects and other ailments.Still, none of them were willing to embrace the emergency request for $1.9 billion that the Obama administration made in February to support research and slow a disease that's already claimed at least one American life. As of May 4, the number of Americans who got the virus while traveling had reached 472. ""There is no easy solution here,"" said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.). ""Throwing money at it is not the ultimate solution. The debate you are hearing now is that the president and the Senate say let's throw $2 billion at it, but at the House, we are more mindful of our budget, saying where is it going? And at the end what does it accomplish?"" Health officials have told Congress that what they want to do is ramp up research on prevention and a vaccine, as well as build out robust response teams, all while figuring out better ways to control the mosquitoes, and educate doctors and the public -- all enormous tasks.Last month, the Obama administration announced that it would shift $600 million from fighting Ebola and other programs to Zika to cover the gaps while Congress argues over funding.The shift has not been without cost, Thomas Frieden, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a March briefing.""From the CDC standpoint we are scraping together every dime we can to respond to this,"" Frieden said. ""It's not an easy thing to do that and it makes the response much more complex and much less smooth because there are different administrative challenges using different sources of funding.""Health officials have warned that some 30 states are at risk for becoming home to Zika-carrying mosquitoes, and that the best way to stem the spread is to act sooner, rather than later in the warmer months. Experts predict that the virus could spread to all Western countries except for Canada and Chile, where the the virus' main carrier, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is not present. There is no vaccine against the virus, and no medication that can effectively eliminate it from a person's system. The mosquito is also growing increasingly resistant to pesticides.Some Republicans hadn't bothered to pay much attention to the crisis.""It's not my issue,"" said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho). ""You know what? I'm not an expert on the mosquitoes,"" said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) ""All I know is it's got the attention of leadership, and they're putting forward a plan.""Others seemed only partially convinced, and were hoping to hear more about the threats before acting.""I'm not sure we need to be jumping into the pool until we know what temperature the water is,"" said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.).""We are moving ahead wisely but very cautiously,""  said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.). ""That's one of reasons we are bringing people in, to make sure we are informed with all the details of the disease. We want to know the potentiality of the spread, as opposed to reading this article, hearing from this organization. We want to bring the top people in to tell us what is the potential problem.""Frieden and other officials from the CDC have testified about Zika and other medical threats to the nation at least seven times since February. The World Health Organization also declared Zika a public health emergency of international concern in February.There were signs Republicans were warming up to taking more aggressive measures.Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) told reporters funding could be boosted next week. Blunt said $1.1 billion of the president's request was on the table. Dent said an unspecified amount could be added to a spending bill in the House, as well.""We will probably pass a supplemental [funding bill] to top the money the administration has got,"" said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), referring to the money moved from Ebola to Zika. ""And we will deal with it in the rest of the appropriations bills for next year. In the meantime, what the administration says it wants to do is react without paying for any of it -- basically it's an emergency, so we don't have to cut spending anywhere. If we are saying this is the priority, so what is less of a priority?""The disease, which was first discovered in Uganda in the 1947, was considered rare until the early 2000s. Last year, Zika struck a number of countries in South America, especially Brazil. As of April 26, the country's health ministry reported that 1,326 babies had been born with microcephaly or brain defects. The WHO estimates Brazil will see more than 2,500 babies born with malformations as a result of the virus. Even though the symptoms can be mild for a healthy adult -- and most people don't even know when they have the disease -- pregnant women are at grave risk. In April, CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat advised women not to travel to areas where Zika is spreading. Frieden has warned that caring for infected babies that could otherwise have been spared could dramatically raise costs.""We know the cost of caring for one infant with a birth defect can be up to $10 million or more,"" urged Frieden during a news conference in March. Still, Republicans did not want to be pushed any faster.""To try and create a sense of a crisis when we ought to be thoughtful and marshaling the resources, I think, is a mistake,"" Cole said.","huffingtonpost","left","16932","zika",1013
"The Zika virus attracted many headlines this winter, but a recent admission by the chief medical officer at a leading vaccine manufacturer -- that the world is ill-prepared to deal with pandemic outbreaks -- underscores a fundamental problem. To ensure safety and efficacy, the federal government's regulatory approval process for new vaccines may extend development timelines for years. So when The New York Times reports that ""eighteen organizations are working on developing a vaccine for the Zika virus,"" it is likely that those companies will labor for a very long time.Vaccinations rightly require strict federal approval processes to ensure the safety and the efficacy of a new vaccination. But when pandemic viruses like Zika spread quickly and unexpectedly, the world realizes there is little that can practically and immediately be done other than to implement strict infection control measures up to and including quarantines. This has been true for prior pandemics such as the swine flu, avian flu, SARS and Ebola.That reality speaks to the need for a new approach to pandemic viruses, including influenza. The good news with Zika is that it is a fairly stable virus, unlike other frequently mutating viruses such as the influenza virus. During the Zika epidemic in Brazil, reported microcephaly cases rocketed to 2,700 in 2015 and at least 40 babies died. By comparison, there were only 147 reported microcephaly cases in Brazil altogether in 2014. In 60 to 80 percent of cases, Zika is asymptomatic and when symptoms do appear, they tend to be mild, such as joint pain, rash, and/or fever. All of this helps to explain why it hasn't been studied much even though it was first identified nearly 70 years ago. Based on our current knowledge, outside of a lengthy approval process we don't expect a major scientific challenge in developing a Zika vaccine.Indeed, thanks to herd immunity, acute infections caused by relatively stable viruses often quickly disappear. By the time there's a vaccine for Zika, the U.S. population may well be largely immune to Zika.But what can be done to improve the hurry-up-and-wait reality of vaccination approval when it comes to more dangerous pandemics? For example, the flu kills up to 500,000 people each year, making it exponentially more damaging than Zika.For starters, more education is needed about the ineffectiveness of seasonal flu vaccinations. Last year's vaccine effectiveness was only 23 percent and as low as 9 percent in people over 65 years old. Flu vaccines are largely inadequate because the flu virus is constantly mutating, resulting in a flawed attempt to guess which vaccine will work best in any given flu season. While this current ""estimation"" approach is the best presently available, there is clearly much room to improve.The situation is even more complex for pandemic flu outbreaks as we never know when, where, and what pandemic flu strain will hit. All we know is that it happens every few years, involving a flu strain new to mankind and therefore potentially much more dangerous than the seasonal flu strains. In addition, approved flu and pandemic vaccine manufacturing processes are more than 70 years old. These processes require four to six months of lead time, primarily because they are produced in poultry eggs.  Modernization of the production cycle clearly can help. More support and resources should be dedicated to potential vaccines that target all flu strains -- seasonal, pandemic and future. Is this a fantasy? Scientists across the world, including those at my company, are hard at work on game-changing 'universal' flu vaccines, including those that act against a denominator common to every influenza strain. It is clear that the existing ""educated guess"" approach to flu vaccinations is inefficient and largely ineffective against viruses that frequently and unpredictably mutate. Some next generation universal flu vaccines, currently under development, aim to encourage the body to use its own immune system against conserved elements of seasonal or pandemic flu viruses, leading to broad and long-lasting protection. On a societal level, with enough people taking such universal flu vaccines, ultimately we can even hope to eradicate the flu. Ron Babecoff is the CEO of BiondVax (www.biondvax.com), a publicly traded biopharma (NASDAQ: BVXV).  BiondVax is one of several life science companies researching new therapies to provide a 'universal' vaccine with the potential to protect against pandemic and seasonal flu.","huffingtonpost","left","16903","zika",731
"President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil delivered a national primetime address on Wednesday night on the Zika virus pandemic that has hit the South American nation with particular severity, detailing how the Brazilian military has begun awareness and fumigation operations nationwide.Unfortunately, in at least four major cities, residents would be hard-pressed to hear Rousseff's address on their televisions over the cacophony of kitchenware being banged in protest out what appeared to be hundreds of windows in each location. The ""panelaços,"" as the protests are called, are intended to demand Rousseff step down from the presidency over an explosive corruption scandal that swept her administration last year.Before assuming the presidency, Rousseff was in charge of the nation's state-run oil corporation, Petrobras. During her tenure, a senior member of Petrobras' corporate leadership was arrested and confessed to a money laundering scheme in which Petrobras would award contracts to corporations friendly to the ruling leftist Workers' Party, in exchange for a 3 percent kickback for political campaigns. Rousseff was cleared of all wrongdoing, but many in Brazil believe it is impossible for her to not have known of this activity while in charge of the organization.""Tonight, I will not talk about politics or economics,"" Rousseff said on Wednesday, before updating the public on the various measures her government is taking to contain the Zika virus. As the Folha de Sao Paulo notes, her urging for the public to keep politics out of her speech last night was ""to no avail.""Hours before her speech, opponents on Twitter urged the public to ""get the pots ready"" to drown Rousseff's speech out with noise.""Dilma will appear on TV to talk about the Zika virus - you all know what to do!"" the above poster reads.For those too lazy to bang a pot, protesters provided a YouTube video to play out their windows, instead:Residents in Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, and Rio de Janeiro - one of the cities most strongly affected by the Zika virus, as it is scheduled to be home to the 2016 Summer Olympics - recorded the sounds of protests from their windows. Below, footage from all four cities, respectively:Some recorded their own personal protests at home while watching Rousseff's address:O Globo notes that, in Sao Paulo, people in traffic joined the protests by honking their horns. ""Drivers stopped the cars in the street, especially in middle-class neighborhoods to protest,"" the newspaper notes. While O Globo estimates the protests in Rio de Janeiro were more tame than during previous presidential addresses, Sao Paulo's protests ""repeated their intensity.""The newspaper notes that, during her address, Rousseff asserted the Brazilian government had dispatched ""a large army of peace and health"" to raise awareness in Zika-affected neighborhoods, and gave ""a special word of comfort"" to the mothers of children affected by Zika: ""We will do everything, absolutely everything that is in our power to protect them. We will do everything, absolutely everything, to support children affected by microcephaly and their families.""Brazil has dispatched over 200,000 members of the military to Zika-affected areas to distribute insect repellant and teach locals how to prevent mosquito spawning nests from surfacing in their neighborhoods. The virus is spread through bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is prevalent throughout the continent; only Chile and Canada do not boast significant populations. While most Zika patients experience mild symptoms - up to 80 percent are asymptomatic - Brazilian researchers have found that a pregnant woman who contracts Zika has a far greater risk of delivering a child with microcephaly, a disorder in which an infant is born with a skull too small for his or her brain. Brazil has registered more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly suspected to have ties to Zika. Rio de Janeiro has begun recording a new cases of Zika every half hour.A large number of people have the virus with no symptoms, so the situation is more serious than we can imagine,"" Brazilian health minister Marcelo Castro told Reuters. ""Our big hope is finding a vaccine.""Brazilians have nonetheless appeared determined to continue with their daily lives. Thursday marks the official beginning of Carnaval, an annual parade festival that, while affected by the Zika pandemic, has not been canceled. Over the weekend, parade-goers used the event to raise awareness regarding how to avoid Zika, with a parade of Olympic gods singing for the Zika virus to go away.Some have already begun to make light of the Zika virus, with one parody site joking that Wednesday's panelaço ""killed 127,000 mosquitos.""","breitbart","right","16835","zika",769
"The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with this birth defect have smaller heads and sometimes brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean, and with the high volume of news about the virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.Here are five updates, opinions and developments to know about now:  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report Friday with details surrounding nine pregnant U.S. travelers with lab-confirmed Zika virus. Of the nine women, two had early pregnancy losses, two had abortions, two remain pregnant, and three gave birth.At least one of the miscarried fetuses tested positive for Zika virus when researchers analyzed expelled tissue. Frieden pointed out, however, that because about 20 percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage, there's no way to know whether Zika virus caused the miscarriage. One of the two aborted fetuses was diagnosed with brain abnormalities via ultrasound, while no information was given on the second. Of the three live births, one infant was born with severe microcephaly, while the other two babies appear to be healthy. The remaining two pregnancies appear to be healthy and without complication.In a press conference to discuss the findings, CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said Friday that scientists may not know for years whether apparently healthy babies who were exposed to Zika virus in the womb will grow up to have other health problems. He also said that scientists don't yet know which stage of the pregnancy, if any, is most vulnerable for a fetus exposed to Zika virus.Brazilian researchers have detailed a single case in which a mother, infected with Zika virus but asymptomatic, had a late-term stillbirth. While it's unclear if Zika virus caused the stillbirth, doctors said the fetus had severe microcephaly and its brain was completely absent, reports Reuters. The skull, as well as parts of the lungs and abdomen, were filled with fluid. They also found that the fetus may have had arthrogryposis, a condition in which joints are stuck in place and can't move.While it is just one case, the researchers noted it was unusual, and that other doctors should watch out for stillbirth as a possible consequence of Zika virus infection. The mother tested negative for other known causes of microcephaly. A woman in Argentina tested positive for Zika virus, despite the fact that she had not traveled to an area with ongoing and active transmission, reports Reuters. Health officials in the country say it could be yet another apparent case of sexual transmission, as the country is not experiencing locally-acquired Zika virus cases. A group of 14 Brazilian and American researchers published a letter Wednesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine that said Brazil's government is being too presumptive about the link between Zika virus and microcephaly, and that their approach to the health crisis is creating a global panic, reports the Associated Press. Some of the complaints in the letter include the fact that Brazil may have been severely underreporting microcephaly cases before the Zika virus epidemic, which means there's no reliable way to tell if microcephaly numbers truly spiked after the disease broke out in Brazil. The group also points out that because the microcephalic births are highly concentrated in the country's poor northeast region, there may be some underlying co-factor or accomplice responsible for these severe birth defects, in addition to or instead of Zika virus.U.S. experts at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, as well as global experts with the World Health Organization, concede that no causal relationship has been proven yet, but that evidence is mounting about the link between Zika virus and microcephaly. Among that evidence: an autopsy of a fetus that suggested the virus was replicating in its brain, as well as the presence of the virus in the amniotic fluid of pregnancies where the fetuses were diagnosed with microcephaly via ultrasound. Brazil is set to host the 2016 Summer Olympics this August, as well as the Paralympic Games in September. But because of the country's ongoing Zika virus epidemic, as well as the disease's potential causal link to severe birth defects, the CDC recommends that pregnant women consider not attending the games. Pregnant women who must go to the Olympics should discuss the travel with their doctor first, and then follow strict mosquito bite prevention protocol throughout the trip. If the male partner in a pregnant couple is going to the Olympics, the couple should use condoms consistently and correctly every time, or practice abstinence during pregnancy. The virus can remain in semen for an unknown amount of time, and U.S. health officials are now investigating several cases of sexual transmission of the disease. Couples who are trying to become pregnant while visiting Brazil during the Olympics should discuss plans with their doctor and be vigilant against mosquito bites.","huffingtonpost","left","16857","zika",878
"Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is asking the White House to appoint a ""Zika czar.""CBS News in Albany reports Schumer saying the Zika czar would ""coordinate between federal agencies and foreign governments to prevent the spread of the virus.""President Barack Obama has already asked for $1.8 billion from Congress for Zika, so the office Schumer envisions would be very well-funded. He encouraged creating the position before mosquito season gets underway in the United States.That would be a very short timetable, as mosquito season will begin fairly soon across much of the southern United States.""With dozens of Zika cases now in America, it's time for the feds to step in and appoint a lead person who can rein in the outbreak before it spreads even further,"" said Schumer, as quoted by the New York Daily News.Syracuse.com notes there have been 11 positive cases of Zika infection among residents of New York State, all of them travelers who visited countries where Zika is spreading.","breitbart","right","16845","zika",167
"SYDNEY, May 16 (Reuters) - Australian pharmaceutical company Starpharma Holdings Ltd said it is teaming up with world No. 2 condom maker Ansell Ltd to supply Zika virus-proof condoms to the Australian Olympic team ahead of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games.Starpharma said it is giving the Australian athletes Ansell ""Dual Protect"" condoms lubricated with Starpharma's VivaGel product, which it recently said showed near-total antiviral protection against Zika and other viruses in laboratory studies.""Given sexual transmission of Zika virus is of increasing importance, the potent activity of Starpharma's VivaGel against Zika could prove very significant,"" said Starpharma Chief Executive Officer Jackie Fairley in a statement.The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said the Starpharma condoms would be in addition to condoms already shipped to the Olympic village, which will also have free dispensing machines on every block supplying 350,000 male condoms and 100,000 female condoms to athletes.The AOC dismissed suggestions that athletes returning from Rio should undergo compulsory blood testing.

"On SiriusXM POTUS's Michael Smerconish Show Thursday, Dr. Art Caplan of the NYU Langone Medical Center urged the Brazilian government and International Olympic Committee to delay the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, warning that tourists will not attend the events due to Latin America's Zika virus pandemic.""Are you really going to try to run the Olympics this August in the middle of a public health emergency when the country can't afford to finish the buildings, and has got to take on the mosquitos?"" Caplan asks, adding the question of what family will say, ""Let's round up the kids and go watch discus in the Zika epidemic?""Such a proposition would be like a family saying, ""Let's visit Chernobyl to enjoy the Olympics!"" he adds.In a Forbes column co-authored with Lee H. Igel, Caplan calls hosting the games in Rio de Janeiro aware of the Zika risk ""irresponsible,"" noting that several athletes have already begun taking precautionary measures against the mosquitos. ""The IOC needs to either move the Games, postpone them, or cancel them. Prevention is the best course in the face of a serious threat to humanity,"" they write.The Brazilian government has not made any indication it is considering postponing the games. Instead, officials have announced a number of precautionary measures to keep venues safe. Last week, over 3,000 health workers fumigated the Sambadrome, the venue that will host most of the Olympic Games' major events, and officials have vowed to execute daily inspections for mosquito nests at all venues. The medical director of the event, Dr. Joao Grangeiro, urged nations not to keep their athletes from participating.""The athletes are not at risk We will not have an epidemic or pandemic situation. We can't say we won't have any cases (during the games) but we see this as a minimal risk,"" he said.""We remain confident that there will be a safe environment for successful and enjoyable Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro,"" the International Olympic Committee said in a statement, echoing Brazilian officials.Brazil has also not canceled other major tourist attractions, like this week's Carnaval. Carnaval is a week of street festivals known for its extravagant outfits and loud music. While some have launched Zika awareness campaigns in the midst of Carnaval events, most major cities have not canceled their events.The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of Zika in the Western Hemisphere a ""public health emergency."" Experts at the National Institutes of Health have deemed the virus outbreak a ""pandemic.""While 80 percent of Zika patients are asymptomatic, and adults with Zika often experience only mild symptoms, researchers have found the virus to have a devastating effect on fetuses when a pregnant mother contracts it. Brazilian Health Minister Marcelo Castro has said there is ""no doubt"" that Zika is tied to microcephaly, a condition in which an infant's skull is too small for his or her brain, causing severe neurological defects. Brazil has recorded over 4,000 cases of microcephaly since medical experts confirmed the presence of the virus in April 2015.","breitbart","right","16835","zika",512
"On the 14th January 2016, the World Health Organisation declared an end of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Less than a day later, a new case in Sierra Leone was detected, indicating that the path to eradication must be paved with vigilance and patience. Indeed, Nigeria -- my home country -- was among the first West African nations to contain the recent Ebola outbreak, as a result of rapid action, resilience and resources, and widespread health education. Lessons from our fight against Ebola can be applied to the recent outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria, which has already claimed 40 lives, with almost 100 reported cases in at least 10 states. The Wellbeing Foundation Africa (WBFA) and I have taken rapid steps to elevate awareness of this deadly disease and its prevention, in line with our health education efforts across Nigeria. Our strong health education platform, #MaternalMonday, is designed to engage and empower individuals on a range of health issues related to health. In light of warnings from the World Health Organisation, WBFA and I have taken steps to educate women globally about Zika Virus and the risks that the virus poses to their health and the health of their children through our #MaternalMonday campaign. We believe that through health education and rapid awareness efforts, we can prevent an outbreak from turning into an epidemic. An acute hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus, Lassa fever can be transmitted through contact with an infected rodent or contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, including mother-to-child transmission and consumption of infected food items. Pregnant women, especially those in the third trimester of pregnancy face a higher risk of contracting the disease -- which causes mortality in 95% of cases. As studies have indicated, the increased likelihood of mortality at this stage of pregnancy is due to immunosuppression associated with the third trimester of pregnancy. To prevent Lassa fever, WBFA have produced an infographic on the importance of hand-washing and rodent control, while warning against contact with infected bodily fluids. In light of the prodigious threat posed by Lassa fever to an already fragile public healthcare system, WBFA and I will also facilitate capacity building for healthcare workers, especially in the areas of reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH), in order to minimize morbidities and mortalities resulting from the disease, especially among vulnerable women and children. Moreover, we will be folding in Lassa fever prevention tips into our #MaternalMonday antenatal health education classes, delivered to expectant mothers across Nigeria to encourage rapid action, awareness, and behavior change amongst patients, so as to stem the spread of disease. Through our Alaafia Universal Health Coverage Fund (AUHCF), we are scaling up access to primary healthcare and building an effective infrastructure for the provision of primary health services, as a solution to containing and preventing future epidemics.

"There have not been any cases of the Zika pandemic reported in India yet, but health authorities are nervous for several reasons, not least of which is that India has already dealt with Zika in the past, logging some of the oldest known cases of infection.The current outbreak is emanating from South America, which makes the threat to India seem relatively remote. The BBC notes that ""so far, Asia is reckoned to be Zika-free,"" with all samples taken from screenings of the Indian population by the National Institute of Virology in Pune testing negative for the virus.But Zika was one of the viruses the National Institute of Virology was founded to combat in 1952, long before it seemed like a serious threat to anyone. The origins of the virus lie with monkeys in the Zika jungles of Uganda, hence the name. Tests by the Institute in 1952 found ""significant numbers"" of people in India had been exposed. The Indian medical community published a paper on Zika the year before the first officially-recognized human case was recorded in Nigeria in 1954.As with other regions affected by the outbreak, Zika in India was formerly regarded as a very minor problem, because its symptoms were so mild. Today, Indian health authorities are worried that it might actually remain ""endemic"" in the population, as the BBC puts it, because it often goes undetected. Only today, in the current outbreak, have doctors learned Zika can cause birth defects when pregnant women are infected, or a devastating reaction in a small percentage of infected adults.India's concerns are exacerbated by recent outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya, spread by the same mosquitoes that carry Zika. As if a dengue outbreak is not bad enough on its own, health experts warn that Zika may follow in dengue's footsteps, with dengue survivors exceptionally vulnerable to Zika infection.The Economic Times of India worries that poor public hygiene in India gives the infection-carrying mosquito ample breeding grounds, and the Indian medical community is not well-prepared to deal with Zika. There are few testing facilities, no screening procedures in place for travelers, and no action plan for handling an outbreak. India's doctors are reportedly preparing themselves by chatting online with experienced Zika-fighters.The Indian medical community seems divided on the Zika threat, with some doctors quoted by the Economic Times dismissing it as a remote problem they can control if it appears, while others say the dangerous strain will ""definitely"" be brought back by Indian travelers to South America eventually, and complaining about inadequate preparations.""We've known mosquitoes are responsible for chikungunya and dengue but are cavalier in tackling their breeding pools. Now, Zika joins this list and we seem clueless how to tackle it,"" writes the Economic Times.One sign of unease in India comes from automaker Tata Motors, which felt obliged to change the name of its heavily-promoted new model, the Zica. The decision came too late for the Auto Expo in New Delhi this week, but a new name is expected to be announced shortly.","breitbart","right","16833","zika",514
"One of two remaining holdouts against Zika on the Western Hemisphere has confirmed its first locally acquired case of the enigmatic virus. The government of Chile has confirmed that a Zika patient contracted the disease from a sexual partner who had been to Haiti.With Chile documenting its first locally acquired case, Canada remains the only country in the Western Hemisphere devoid of Zika.Chile's Health Ministry described the patient as a 46-year-old woman whose partner had traveled to Haiti and contracted Zika, then transmitted it sexually to her. While the Chilean government has confirmed individuals with Zika to have entered the country in the past, these were not considered local cases, as they had been exposed to the virus abroad and posed little to no risk of transmitting it to others within Chile. Ten individuals, confirmed to have traveled to Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil, are the previously monitored cases.""Despite the confirmation of these cases, this is not a health risk for the population, since continental Chile does not have the mosquito that transmits the disease,"" Chile's Health Minister Gisela Alarcon said last week, before the latest case was confirmed.Chile does not have a population of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito known to carry dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya, as well as Zika. Without the mosquito, the only known way for Zika to enter a human bloodstream is through sexual contact. Authorities in the United States suggest that men who have contracted Zika wait at least six months before attempting to conceive a child, while women are advised to wait two months.Conceiving children is a paramount concern for those who contract Zika. While its symptoms  - fever, fatigue, and conjunctivitis in some cases - are mild, and up to 80 percent of those affected are asymptomatic, scientists in Brazil have found a link between the Zika virus and a birth defect known as microcephaly, in which an infant is born with a skull too small for his or her brain, crushing the brain and causing significant brain damage. Brazil has documented 6,480 cases of microcephaly suspected of having ties to Zika as of last week, with authorities at the World Health Organization (WHO) expecting at least 2,500 of those to be confirmed as Zika-related.The government of Panama has confirmed one case of Zika-related microcephaly, while Colombia is currently investigating 41 cases. Scientists have yet to explain why the Zika virus appears so much more likely to cause microcephaly in pregnant women in Brazil than other affected areas.Brazil and Colombia are considered the hardest-hit nations in this particular Zika outbreak. Many suspect Venezuela also boasts thousands of cases, but due to the collapsing infrastructure of its socialist healthcare system, documentation regarding Zika cases in Venezuela is limited. Colombian officials have also accused Venezuelan government officials of intentionally avoiding documenting Zika.The microcephaly cases have triggered a push by leftist politicians and organizations to reconsider Latin America's strict pro-life laws and allow women to abort their children if they are found to have Zika. In Brazil, abortions are allowed to save the life of the mother, and all abortions must be approved by a judge. Abortionist organizations have, nonetheless, promoted the termination of pregnancies in cases of Zika, even when no evidence exists that the child will develop a neurological disorder. The Brazilian government has also had to struggle with illegal smuggling of abortion drugs into the country from pro-abortion organizations working internationally. Amid protests from pro-abortion groups that the government should not intervene when said groups ship illegal drugs into the country, Brazilian authorities have emphasized their ""duty"" to uphold the law.The Latin American tourism industry has raised concerns that the notoriety of the Zika virus will hurt the industry significantly, as many reconsider their vacations in the region, particularly if they are expecting a child. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States has issued travel warnings for the affected areas, and a number of hotel chains reported a small spike in cancellations. The impact remains small; however, some wonder whether tourism to one event in particular - the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro - will suffer amid Zika concerns.","breitbart","right","16888","zika",698
"Operations to help curb the spread of the Zika virus are well underway in Virginia and Maryland, where a total of 32 people have been reported as being infected by the mosquito-borne disease.As of Thursday, 15 people had been infected in Virginia, where Gov. Terry McAuliffe has formed a task force that coordinates public outreach and distribution of Zika prevention kits.In addition, Virginia has launched several other prevention campaigns, including 450,000 door hangers, a TV public service announcement and radio spots, The Associated Press reported.""This is a community challenge, not just a health department or a doctor's challenge. It is everybody's challenge to reduce the risk of mosquito bites,"" said Dr. Stephen Haering, health director for the city of Alexandria. He said the city is providing resources through its health department website and plans to distribute information via homeowners associations and public schools.Both Virginia and Maryland have collaborated with their local jurisdictions in prevention and preparation programs. Each state has funded the creation and distribution of 10,000 Zika prevention kits - packs of mosquito repellent, larvae spray, educational materials and condoms - to the localities, which then distribute them to obstetricians/gynecologists and clinics.In Maryland, the number of reported cases of Zika have more than doubled in just a month and a half, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Eight people in the state were infected with Zika at the beginning of April; last week, that number jumped to 17.The CDC has reported that as many as 544 people have been infected by Zika, whose symptoms can include fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes.Mary Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, said county officials have begun several campaigns since Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan proclaimed the last week in April as ""Zika Virus Awareness Week."" County residents can expect to receive informational mailers and see posters about the virus in county buildings and Ride On buses, she said.""We don't know if we will have locally acquired cases of Zika, but we have to prepare people with information and concrete steps,"" Ms. Anderson said. ""And if we don't [have local cases], people are still doing something to get rid of mosquitoes because [they] are a nuisance - whether they carry West Nile virus or Zika or are just a plain old summer nuisance.""Zika is spread primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, but also can be transmitted through pregnancy and sex. Almost all 544 domestic cases of Zika were brought to the U.S. from people who had visited affected areas in South America and the Caribbean. According to the CDC, there are no reported cases of mosquito transmission in the U.S., but there have been cases of sexual transmission.Though the illness is usually mild - with 80 percent of infected individuals showing no symptoms - Zika poses a considerable threat for pregnant women. The CDC has confirmed a link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and microcephaly, a condition in which fetuses experience decreased head growth, abnormal brain development and other birth defects. As of last week, 157 of the reported U.S. cases are pregnant women.The CDC alerted its emergency operations center about the outbreak in late January. Just over two weeks later, the CDC raised Zika to the highest level of emergency activation, calling the outbreak a major event.The first report of sexually transmitted Zika - one of only 10 such cases in the U.S. - was reported in early February.The virus has been active for decades but resurfaced in headlines last year, when Brazil confirmed its first case. This news has caused a stir in the international community as people debate whether Brazil should host the Summer Olympics this year, given the potential danger for pregnant women. ","washingtontimes","right","16944","zika",631
"Scientists think a type of genetically modified mosquito could help stop the march of Zika virus, a disease that's spreading in 37 countries and territories around the world.The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector for Zika virus, and making genetic tweaks to the population could one day either stop the mosquitoes from reproducing or prevent them from carrying diseases that threaten human beings. Preliminary findings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration indicate that using genetically modified mosquitos to fight Zika virus shouldn't have a significant impact on the environment, Reuters reports. Those findings are in line with the environmental assessment submitted by Oxitec, the British biotechnology company that developed the modified mosquito.Before the threat of Zika, Oxitec was having trouble getting FDA approval to test its GMO mosquitos in the Florida Keys, the Associated Press reports. Zika virus could change that.""The data seems to be promising in terms of reducing the mosquito populations in those small field trials, but we need to go through our process, and we are greatly expediting the process,"" said FDA assistant commissioner Dr. Luciana Borio at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on Zika preparedness earlier this month. So far, genetically modified mosquitos have been tested in several forms. Oxitec reported exciting success in the field with its ""self-limiting strain"" -- a male mosquito that reproduces baby mosquitoes that never make it past the pupae stage. Releasing this male, non-biting mosquito in the Cayman Islands in 2010 led to an 80 percent suppression of the Aedes aegypti in the test region, and releasing it again in the suburb of Juazeiro, Bahia, Brazil in 2011 resulted in an 81 to 95 percent suppression.Scientists are also working on breeding mosquitos that are genetically resistant to diseases like dengue, malaria and -- in the future -- Zika virus. ""Aedes is generally an invasive species, so removing an invasive species shouldn't have any negative ecological implications in terms of the environment,"" Omar Akbari, an assistant professor at the University of California's Center for Disease Vector Research, told The Huffington Post.The Aedes aegypti most likely originated in Africa and spread throughout the world via trade and shipping activities, according to the CDC.""I don't think removing the species would be harmful in any way, and [the species] doesn't serve any positive benefit in these areas where it's invasive to,"" Akbari said, noting that climate change has increased the Aedes' habitable territory.""This places many more countries now at risk of diseases transmitted by this vector, including Zika and dengue fever, than ever before,"" he said.Many such methods are in use already. To combat its ongoing Zika outbreak, Brazil deployed national army troops to go door-to-door to hunt down mosquito breeding sites and raise awareness about mosquito bite prevention. Public health experts are advising Brazilians to make sure they're dumping excess water from their flower pots. Other traditional mosquito control measures include repellant fogging, breeding mosquito-eating fish in stagnant water, and many kinds of poisons that address every stage of the insect's life cycle. Unfortunately, that's not enough. In order to stop the spread of Zika virus, as well as make sure a widespread outbreak like it never happens again, Brazil is going to have to think bigger: total mosquito eradication. The South American country achieved mosquito eradication once before. In the 1950s, malaria and yellow fever prompted Brazil and several other nations to launch a campaign to kill mosquitoes with DDT, a toxic chemical that's really good at killing insects, but, unfortunately, also good at killing birds and fish. The eradication campaign became less urgent with its apparent success, coupled with increasing concern over the environmental effects of DDT and the advent of the yellow fever vaccine. Pockets of the mosquitos became resistant to DDT, and the population roared back in the absence of this scorched earth approach, explained Akbari.Because of DDT's affect on the environment, as well as emerging evidence that the chemical and its byproducts are linked to cancer, decreased fertility, miscarriage and other health complications, DDT is no longer a realistic option for Brazil's new war against mosquitos and Zika virus, Akbari said. Instead, the future of mosquito eradication means pitting mosquitoes against themselves. Yes. Oxitec has previously tested genetically modified pink bollworms, designed to reduce cotton pests in Arizona, the Associated Press reports. The company also has plans in the works for field trials of diamondback moths in upstate New York.Despite the fact that genetically modified insects haven't been proven safe, Akbari is on board with experimentation in the field. ""I think the future is leaning toward genetic control,"" he said.

"Senate Democrats pleaded with Republican leaders Monday to take up President Obama's $1.9 billion request to combat the Zika virus ""as soon as possible,"" saying the mosquito-borne illness poses a real threat to pregnant women.The Obama administration recently shifted $510 million from the largely successful fight against Ebola in West Africa to the new threat, which has been directly tied to serious birth defects and other problems.Forty Senate Democrats and two independents said that was a stopgap measure, so new money is still needed.""Although [the transfer] was necessary in the face of congressional inaction and the growing and rapidly changing public health threat posed by Zika, it would be shortsighted and dangerous for Congress not to act quickly to give the administration the resources it needs to fully fight the Zika virus and protect Americans,"" their letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.The White House has ratcheted up its own rhetoric in recent days, accusing the GOP of sleepwalking while Zika threatens its shores.House appropriators say they are ready to disburse funds as needed, but want more detailed information about how the money would be used.Democrats said the request cannot wait. Researchers have confirmed a link between the Zika epidemic and an uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, and they are investigating its ties to a syndrome that can cause paralysis.The U.S. territories have reported 471 locally acquired Zika cases, most of them in Puerto Rico.While it isn't circulating on the U.S. mainland, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 358 cases that were brought back by travelers to the hot zone and a handful of sexually transmitted cases.Health officials said they expect locally transmitted cases when temperatures rise, making the climate more hospitable to the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus.Democrats said it isn't clear how far north those mosquitoes will travel, raising the stakes in the fight.""We cannot delay approving critical resources to assist in the Zika response,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""We must act now to pass the president's request for supplemental funding."" ","washingtontimes","right","16909","zika",354
"Health officials of the United States and United Nations are complaining that Brazil is not providing enough data and fresh samples to help them combat the Zika viral outbreak.The Associated Press cites sources who said that ""having so little to work with is hampering their ability to track the virus' evolution."" The AP cites reports claiming that Brazil has provided fewer than twenty samples during the current outbreak.""Laboratories in the United States and Europe are being forced to work with samples from previous outbreaks, and is frustrating efforts to develop diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines,"" the AP adds.America's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is reportedly working with a Zika strain taken from a 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia, as are the French, while the U.K. is using samples from an even older Micronesian outbreak in 2007.Surprisingly, the obstacle appears to be mostly legal in nature: Brazil has laws that prevent its researchers from sharing genetic material, including blood samples. The relevant Brazilian laws were implemented fairly recently, so the necessary regulatory framework remains largely unwritten. The American and Brazilian governments are said to be working on removing these legal obstacles.Several scientists quoted by the Associated Press are debating the consequences of such a limited supply. Some believe the sample scarcity was not a serious obstacle yet, because there is no effective vaccine awaiting production. Others expressed frustration at the difficulty of developing diagnostic routines, or studying the link between Zika and suspected birth defects, without an adequate supply of current material. One researcher spoke of essentially smuggling samples out of Brazil, courtesy of wealthy patients with the will and means to defy the law.Although scientists quoted by the AP universally stressed the importance of sharing samples and data, it is also noted that Brazil is not the only country that makes it difficult, and this is not the first time research into an epidemic has been hampered by legal hassles or government interference. ""More than a decade ago, WHO faced a similar problem when Indonesia refused to hand over bird flu samples, arguing that Western scientists would use them to make drugs and vaccines the country couldn't afford,"" the AP recalls.On Friday afternoon, a follow-up report from the Associated Press said that Brazilian officials have agreed to send a set of Zika samples to the United States. The earlier AP report, which touched off ""a flurry of messages acknowledging that existing data-sharing mechanisms were deficient"" from World Health Organization officials, was credited with convincing Brazil to provide more research material.","breitbart","right","16839","zika",428
"Gennady Onishchenko, former head of the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection (Rospotrebnadzor) and former chief sanitary doctor of Russia, told the BBC he believes the United States is involved in the widespread presence of Zika virus worldwide.""Why am I still worried about the Abkhazian coast, which houses the mosquito?"" asked Onishchenko. ""It worries me because somewhere the 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the place where this mosquito lives today is a military microbiology laboratory of the United States Army."" The laboratory was built to help combat measles, a reasoning Onishchenko rejects.He added: ""The presence of American laboratories and the presence of the mosquito, I am concerned about in terms of deliberate interference in the natural course of epidemic process. It dramatically increases the possibility that mosquitoes may be deliberately contaminated.""The U.S. Defense Threat Agency (DTRA) built the labs in 2011. The Pentagon gave the laboratory to the Georgian National Center for Disease Control in 2013.Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that Onishchenko ""showed a fondness for conspiracy theories"" when he held office as sanitary doctor and head on the watchdog group. He commanded ""several politically charged bans on foreign products,"" including wines from Georgia and Moldova and the import ban of produce from the European Union.Russia documented its first case of Zika after an unnamed woman returned from a trip to the Dominican Republic.""The person with the virus is currently at an infectious diseases hospital, her condition is satisfactory,"" declared Rospotrebnadzor, the Russian consumer watchdog group. ""Medical observation of family members was established, no clinical manifestations of the virus were registered among them, and they tested negative for the Zika virus.""Onishchenko did not say if the government should ban travel to the Dominican Republic or other areas with the Zika virus.""Well, was it really necessary to travel to the Dominican Republic? Probably not,"" he answered.Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry Zika virus. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations in the Western Hemisphere - Chile and Canada - have recorded populations of the mosquito species living there. Researchers found the mosquito in Sochi, located on the Black Sea. The scientists recommended the country implement control measures ""to reduce the possible risks of importing exotic vector-borne infections, such as dengue and chikungunya.""In late January, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian scientists to develop a vaccine for the virus. The scientists hope to patent one by March.Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the country wants the vaccine because officials desire ""a full inventory of vaccines"" and to ship it to countries impacted by Zika.Experts believe a fully legalized vaccine is still a decade away. Researchers hope, though, to have an emergency vaccine by the end of the year.""This vaccine is easy to produce. It could be cranked to very high levels in a really short time,"" said Canadian scientist Gary Kobinger.Two groups currently working on the vaccines want to begin human testing in August. Kobinger anticipates the human tests will be good enough for governments to ""allow the use of it in emergency situations.""On Friday, Brazil and the University of Texas signed an agreement to develop a Zika vaccine.

"An expert in pediatric infectious diseases told reporters in Dallas that people in Texas who are infected with the Zika virus could infect mosquitoes and start a new ""transmission cycle"" in Texas.Dr. Jeffrey Kahn is the chief of pediatric infectious diseases for the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. He also serves a director of infectious diseases at Children's Medical Center. In an interview with NBCDFW in Dallas on Tuesday, Dr. Kahn said, ""As we head towards springtime, if we have a lot of people infected with Zika, either because they are imported cases or sexually acquired cases, that may trigger the mosquitoes to get infected with the virus and start that transmission cycle. And, once that occurs, it's almost impossible to get the virus out of the population.""The doctor's comment came following the first reported case in Texas of the Zika virus being transmitted by sexual contact, as reported by Breitbart Texas' Merrill Hope. A patient who had contracted the disease while travelling to a country where the Zika virus is active passed the virus along to their partner via sexual contact.""Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,"" said Zachary Thompson, Dallas County Health and Human Services director. ""Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any sexually-transmitted infections.""Dallas County officials told NBCDFW they know there are already mosquitoes in the Dallas area that are the type that can carry the virus. They are now attempting to trap mosquitoes to get a count of how many of that particular type are in the area.So far, there have been no cases reported where a person became infected without either traveling to a foreign country where the virus is active in mosquitoes or by having sexual contact with an infected person.Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and is a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

"County health officials in Texas are taking precautions and using diligence in protecting Texans from the Zika virus. State officials have already confirmed six travel-related cases of the virus and are using caution to both protect and warn Texans about the dangers of the virus.The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) confirmed as of late Friday, that six Texans have contacted the virus, as reported by Breitbart Texas' Merrill Hope. There are four more suspected cases. All of these individuals contacted the virus when they were out of the United States.County officials are checking mosquito traps daily, reported the Dallas Morning News. The county has fortunately not found one mosquito that has tested positive for the Zika virus.Dr. Mustapha Debboun, director of the Dallas County health department's mosquito control division was reported to say, ""With nature, you never know. But we'll be prepared.""An infectious disease epidemiologist at the UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston, Dr. Catherine Troisi, was reported by the Dallas news outlet to have said, ""We will see [locally-acquired] cases, I can guarantee we will.""Two women in Houston have been reported to have contacted the virus when they were in Columbia and El Salvador. The Houston area is home to about 104,000 El Salvadorans, 21,000 Columbians, and 3,300 Brazilians, reported the Morning News. Of course, some of these individuals travel back to their homeland for visits and are placing themselves at risk to contract the disease.The TDSHS reports as of Monday morning that there has been no reported local transmission of the disease in the continental United States. However, as reported by Breitbart Texas' Merrill Hope, the Texas Gulf Coast could be the ""hardest hit"" in any outbreak of the virus.Mosquitoes are rampant in the spring and outbreaks of any disease are more likely at that time. Economically depressed areas in Texas are potential dangerous breeding grounds.The danger of the virus in Texas and the states initially comes from travel to, or from those who have been in El Salvador, Brazil, and Columbia. These countries in particular have seen a huge outbreak of the virus.Breitbart News reported that Brazil launched a door-to-door campaign using 220,000 soldiers. There has been 4,000 fetus affected cases and approximately 200 more are diagnosed every week.Brazilian authorities ordered health workers to sterilize Rio de Janeiro's Sambadrome. It will serve as the center of the 2016 Summer Olympics and officials are doing this to combat spread of the Zika virus, reported Breitbart News.Pregnant women and their unborn children are the most susceptible to the virus, as reported by Breitbart Texas.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a travel advisory and have warned pregnant women to not travel to Latin and Central America - areas that have been hit hard by the disease.Health authorities also ask that those returning from areas that have had an outbreak of the virus, be careful not to be bitten by mosquitoes even if they do not have symptoms, reported the Morning News.As Merrill Hope reported, the virus is spread by the same two kinds of Aedes mosquitoes that carry Dengue fever which is prevalent on the Texas-Mexico border. These mosquitoes also carry Chikungunya which was first reported in Texas in 2014. As reported by Breitbart Texas, there were more cases reported last year.Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told the Morning News that the Pan American Health Organization has been effective in addressing public health campaigns in the past. The organization serving the Americas has been effective in mosquito eradication programs by getting rid of freestanding water and by using chemicals that kill the insects and their eggs.As reported by Breitbart Texas and Breitbart News, Planned Parenthood and elected officials have used the virus as an opportunity to promote, and grant women the ability to have an abortion. Abortion is illegal in many Latin American countries. As reported by Breitbart News' Edwin Mora, leftist groups and government officials are pushing pregnant women in the Americas to abort their children affected with brain deformities connected with the virus.The signs and symptoms of the Zika virus include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, reports the Texas coastal region's Galveston County Health District. The symptoms generally begin three to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Severe consequences to a non-pregnant individual is uncommon. Those infected generally suffer mild symptoms and recover after several days or a week.The Galveston County Health District has advised those who have to travel to Brazil, Columbia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico, to prevent themselves from mosquito bites. Travelers are cautioned to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants and use insect repellents containing DEET.In order to curb spread of the disease and prevent any outbreak, the Texas Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Act requires health officials, dentists, and veterinarians to report any patient suspected of having the disease.The Center for Disease Control has a link that addresses the most commonly asked questions about the Zika virus.There have been two suspected cases of sexual transmission of the Zika virus, as reported by Breitbart News.Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

"One more uphill battle for an embattled leader of a country in crisisThe epicenter of the Zika virus epidemic, Brazil has launched a major offensive against the mosquito born disease that has contaminated more than 1.5 million people in the country in less than a year and could infect an estimated 4 million in the Americas, including in the United States, in the next twelve months. The World Health Organization declared Zika a global health emergency on February 1st. Although it is asymptomatic in most cases, the rapid spread of the virus has alarmed health officials after the birth of hundreds of babies with abnormal small heads in the Brazilian Northeastern region. Scientists have yet to fully establish and explain the connection between Zika and microcephaly. Marcelo Castro, Brazil's Health minister, said last week that he "" is absolutely sure"" that the virus is the cause of the condition in at least 41 of 3,800 cases under study. The WHO is not so certain. ""The experts agreed that a causal relationship between Zika infection during pregnancy and microcephaly is strongly suspected, though not yet scientifically proven,"" said WHO General Director Dr. Margaret Chan. Biologist Fernando Reinarch, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, agrees with the cautious approach taken so far by international health experts. He says that microcephaly is not new and that the recent explosion in the number of cases may be explained in part by a change in the reporting criteria in Brazil, which became mandatory only last year, after doctors and health officials started to see in the state of Pernambuco an unusual number of babies born with brains smaller than the 33 centimeters in diameter considered normal. In his February 6th column for the daily Estado de S.Paulo, Reinach noted that Brazil and the US use the same definition for microcephaly. In the US, some 25,000 babies, or 0,6% percent of the 3 million newborns every year, are reported to have the condition, from various causes. Using the same percentage, Reinach estimated in 19,250 the number of children born with microcephaly in Brazil per year. The change to mandatory reporting of microcephaly, not Zika, may explain the sudden increase in the number of cases. A ""war"" against the virus Wearing tee-shirt and hat proclaiming that the mosquito that spreads Zika ""is not stronger than an entire nation,"" president Dilma Rousseff led an unprecedented national mobilization against the disease on Saturday February 13th. All members of her cabinet and hundreds of senior officials, including the president of the Central Bank and the number two at the ministry of Foreign Affairs, joined 200,000 soldiers who were dispatched to 350 cities to raise awareness and share information about the use of insect repellent and ways to prevent accumulation of stagnant water in abandoned tires and discarded small plastic containers in or near homes -- preferred breeding grounds for the Aedes aegypti, the virus vector.""In the past, we won the war against yellow fever, and we are going to win the war against Zika"", Rousseff said in Rio de Janeiro. ""We are trying to catch up after decades of abandonment in terms of sanitation,"" added the president, whose Workers Party has been in power for the past thirteen years. The former capital of Brazil, Rio is thousands of miles from the region most affected by Zika. But it was chosen as the starting point of national mobilization for a good reason. The city will host this year's Summer Olympics, in August, and local and federal officials fear the event could become a global public relations nightmare if they fail to convince athletes and hundreds of thousands of Brazilian and foreign tourists expected to attend that the situation is under control and chances of contamination by Zika are minimal. Since the games will take place during the Southern hemisphere winter, when mosquitoes' populations are smaller and less active, the government campaign will likely succeed and avoid adding an Olympic fiasco to its many problems: a deep economic recession, now in its second year, a major corruption scandal still unraveling and a severe political crisis that has produced a yet unresolved impeachment process against the embattled Rousseff. It is uncertain, however, whether a high profile offensive to contain Zika virus will help the president regain the political credibility she needs to govern and start moving the country away from its unhealthy current path.Brazil's ambassador to Washington, Luis Alberto Figueiredo Machado, wrote recently that Brazil is doing its part in many fronts in the global fight against Zika and had deployed 300,000 health workers to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds before last week's national mobilization. The complexity of the epidemic and the government's poor crisis management record suggest the challenge posed by Zika and microcephaly is one more uphill battle for the president. On the positive side, Brazilian doctors, scientists and public health officials working on the frontlines of the campaign against the virus are respected by their peers worldwide and have been praised for their response to the epidemic. A recent PBS NewsHour report on Zika highlighted the dedication of doctors such as obstetrician Adriana Scavuzzi and neurologist Ana Van der Linden in Recife, the capital of the state of Pernambuco which is ground zero of the epidemic and has seen most cases of microcephaly reported so far. Both doctors have been working incessantly on the problem with epidemiologists and other public health professionals in Brazil and abroad since April of last year, when the first cases were confirmed.  Brazil and US working on vaccineDr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, highlighted the ongoing cooperation with their Brazilian counterparts at a hearing jointly held on February 10 by three House Subcommittees. Dr. Fauci highlighted the agreement reached with the São Paulo-based Instituto Butantã to develop a vaccine against Zika within five years. The head of Brazil's Health Ministry Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance, Dr. Claudio Maierovitch Pessanha Henriques, shared valuable information on the work the country's health officials are conducting in collaboration with colleagues in the US and in neighboring countries in South America during a telephone conference organized by the Council on Foreign Relations on February 5th. President Barack Obama has requested a $1.8 billion supplemental budget to the combat and prevention of Zika. Finance minister Nelson Barbosa said the government will not reduce funds for the fight against Zika.Providing the resources public health officials and researchers need to conduct their work is key to ensure the continuity of their efforts to understand and contain the spread of the virus, expected to reach Southern parts of the United States in the Summer, according to Laurie Garret, Senior Fellow for Global Health at the CFR. These were key ingredients of the successful strategy Brazil developed against the pandemic of HIV-AIDS virus in the 1990, in collaboration with the US and France, which later benefited countries in Latin America and Africa.In the toxic political environment prevailing in Brazil, however, it would be naïve to underestimate the negative implications of attempts by the government or the opposition to use the Zika virus crisis to score political points. Senator Marta Suplicy, a founding member of the president's Workers Party and a former minister of her cabinet turned adversary, described the government offensive against Zika as too little too late in a newspaper article last Friday. ""The red flags were already there,"" wrote Suplicy, who left the Rousseff's party last year and is likely to run later this year for mayor of São Paulo, a position she once held. ""The federal government is sending the Armed Forces to assist in the fight against the mosquito that transmits the virus. Very good. But the issue is deeper: if we don't tackle the structural problems, we will continue to suffer setbacks,"" added the senator, referring to problems such as lack of access to safe drinking water and sewer services that still affects 17 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, of Brazil's 200 million people. Unguarded statements can also complicate the campaign to contain the virus. On February 1st, the day the WHO declared the epidemic ""a health emergency of international concern,"" minister of Health Castro made a brutally candid assessment of the country's chances to contain the spread of Zika, saying Brazil was ""badly losing"" the battle against the Aedes aegypti. Suplicy and Castro statements were factually correct. But in the current circumstances they are meaningless and only compound the sense of frustration and hopelessness that the Zika epidemic added to the country's many challenges.","huffingtonpost","left","16853","zika",1455
"HOUSTON, Texas - Officials in Harris County (Houston) are partnering with technology-giant Microsoft to test a new trap designed to only capture the type of mosquitoes that can carry the Zika virus. The Houston area will be the first community in the U.S. to use this technology.Harris County officials announced ""Project Premonition"" on Wednesday in partnership with Microsoft. The new mosquito trap device observes distinctive profiles to determine the species of the insect before capturing it. It uses profiling techniques to monitor characteristics like how the mosquito flaps its wings to determine its species, the Houston Chronicle reported.""With Harris County's deep, long-running expertise in mosquito surveillance and mosquito-borne diseases, they're really an ideal partner,"" Microsoft researcher Ethan Jackson told the local newspaper. ""They can tell us that this is the right way to use this data for public health purposes.""The project will also use sophisticated drones to determine areas that host certain mosquitoes in the county.Ten traps will be deployed across Harris County to track and monitor the Zika-prone mosquitoes. They measure the time of day the particular mosquitoes are out, the temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity. Three of the traps have already been placed in the county. The balance will be deployed over the next few weeks.Harris County officials said this project is a giant leap forward in technology to track disease-carrying mosquitoes, Microsoft reported in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. ""It's really 1,000 times better,"" said Mustapha Debboun, the director of Harris County Public Health's mosquito control division.""For a scientist this a dream come true,"" Debboun told Microsoft.The devices have technology to determine and capture only the specific types of mosquitoes researchers want to monitor, the statement revealed. ""In a county with this size and scope, we don't have the resources to just cover the county and spray, spray, spray,"" said Les Becker, the deputy director and director of operations for Harris County Public Health. ""We've got to figure out how to do it as efficiently as possible.""""Project Premonition"" was first carried out in Grenada in 2015 after an outbreak of the Chikungunya virus in that country. That virus is also transmitted by mosquitoes to humans.Microsoft is providing the equipment at no cost to Harris County taxpayers.The trap uses 64 ""smart cells"" and can capture that number of mosquitoes during a 14 to 16-hour testing cycle, the Houston Chronicle reported. Some of the data is transmitted wirelessly to a data collection center. Additional data is saved on the device's internal memory card.While no mosquitoes have yet to be found carrying the Zika virus, Microsoft is already obtaining valuable data. ""The data that we're seeing from even this first week is interesting. We can already see that the traps can distinguish between certain species of mosquitoes in real time,"" Jackson told the Houston news outlet. ""If you want to monitor Zika vectors or you want to monitor West Nile vectors, the trap can actually tell them apart and only capture the ones you're interested in studying.""He said Harris County was picked as the U.S. test site because of the outstanding reputation of the Harris County Mosquito Control Program.

Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican who is leading bipartisan negotiations. Their tentative plan calls for $1.1 billion in emergency funding, but he said they're unlikely to finalize the bill before the Senate takes a break next week.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada told the GOP to work faster, warning Zika is ""already upon us"" in Puerto Rico and will puncture the mainland as temperatures climb.He said the Senate shouldn't take its vacation next week if it hasn't passed a bill.Meanwhile the White House said Republicans' demands for more information are an excuse to delay.

""And I don't think their constituents are going to find it an acceptable response, when there is a widespread media freakout about the Zika virus, that Republicans haven't acted because they didn't get their questions answered.""Tuesday's war of words escalated a series of spending fights that are unfolding in a topsy-turvy election year.From the opioids epidemic to the lead-tainted water crisis in Flint, Michigan, Democrats have urged Republican leaders to ""do their job"" and post billions in emergency spending to stamp out the crises, before they incur even greater costs down the road.While Senate Democrats cheered a water resources bill that includes tens of millions for Flint and other communities affected by lead-tainted drinking water, Democrats on the other side of the Capitol said House bills to combat opioids addiction required more funding to actually work.Republicans are leery of new spending, however, saying they do not want to burden taxpayers if there is untapped money sitting in government accounts.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told Democrats not to use the debate over Zika money to sour the chances for Congress to pass the dozen annual appropriations bills required to keep the government open.""Don't trying try to use the Zika crisis to hold hostage our ability to do our regular appropriation work,"" the Texas Republican said. ""It's too important.""The Centers for Disease Control has recorded nearly 400 travel-related cases of Zika in the states and D.C., including some instances of sexual transmission, but say the virus will swirl on its own with the proliferation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito this summer.Indeed, Senate Republicans have acknowledged that Zika poses a real threat. But they also know that any deal would have to win approval from the fractious House GOP caucus, where conservatives are already upset about spending hikes the parties agreed to last fall.An influential conservative group, Heritage Action, urged GOP leaders last week to offset any new money to combat the virus with budget cuts elsewhere.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the White House already shifted nearly $600 million, including $510 million from the Ebola fight in West Africa, to the Zika fight.""There is enough money there, especially to deal with this year,"" the California Republican said Tuesday. ""So we'll go through the appropriations process for next year. It's the best place to handle it. It's the best place to get the answers, and this will be a bipartisan solution.""Undeterred, House Democrats filed a bill Monday to fully fund Mr. Obama's nearly $2 billion request for emergency spending, which Congress would tack onto the deficit rather than searching for offsets to pay for them.The White House says that money is needed to pursue better diagnostic tests and a vaccine, while boosting mosquito-control efforts. ","washingtontimes","right","16917","zika",700

"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Tuesday issued interim guidelines for health care professionals in the United States caring for infants born to mothers who traveled or lived in an area with Zika virus transmission during pregnancy.The guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call for pediatricians to work closely with obstetricians caring for pregnant women exposed to the virus during pregnancy, monitoring fetal ultrasounds and testing infants with signs of a birth defect called microcephaly marked by small head size.The guidelines come after thousands of infants in Brazil were born with microcephaly, which was believed to be linked to Zika infections. In studies of the current outbreak in Brazil, genetic material from the Zika virus has been identified in studies of brain tissue, placenta and amniotic fluid from several infants with microcephaly and from miscarried fetuses from women infected with the virus.Although Zika transmission has not yet been reported in the United States, mosquitoes that carry the infection are endemic to specific regions of the United States, and experts believe transmission is likely in the coming months as the weather heats up.In the interim guidelines for pediatricians, the CDC recommends that infants with microcephaly born to women exposed to Zika while pregnant should be tested for the virus. For infants without microcephaly but whose mothers received a positive or inconclusive test for the virus, the guidelines call for the child to be tested for possible Zika infection.The guidance also informs U.S. doctors that Zika is a nationally notifiable condition, meaning that suspected cases must be reported to state and territorial health departments.No treatments or vaccines are available for Zika infections.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by James Dalgleish) ","huffingtonpost","left","16826","zika",317
"As Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, continues to dominate the headlines, personal stories are coming to the forefront. One mother whose son was born with microcephaly, the birth defect believed to be linked to the Zika virus, describes the difficulty of facing her son's future without certainty that he'll ever be able to walk or talk.With the high volume of news about the Zika virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage here -- or read our daily recaps here. Here's the latest information you should know:Fernanda Rocha's son Luis Felipe was born with microcephaly, a birth defect that causes babies to have smaller than normal heads. This condition often results in developmental problems and is believed to be linked to the mosquito-borne Zika virus outbreak in Brazil. Rocha's doctors don't know if her son will ever be able to walk or talk.The rare neurological disorder causes tingling, muscle weakness and temporary paralysis. Although Guillain-Barre has not been definitively linked to the Zika virus, both countries reported a jump in cases of the disorder, although not all of the cases are confirmed. Previously, a spike in reported cases of Guillain-Barre coincided with a 2013 outbreak of Zika virus in French Polynesia.The company started a formal Zika vaccine-testing program last fall and has previously worked on vaccines for other infectious diseases, such as West Nile virus and chikungunya.American Airlines says it hasn't suffered a decrease in travel bookings because of Zika virus so far. The company is offering pregnant passengers and their travel partners refunds for tickets to Zika-affected regions. Malaysia prepared for the Zika virus to ""spread quickly"" if introduced, while Thailand -- where there have been an average of five Zika cases a year since the disease was first detected in the country in 2012 -- stressed its strong public health system and medium country size. ","huffingtonpost","left","16829","zika",435
"Dr. Art Caplan of the NYU Langone Medical Center appeared on Breitbart News Daily Friday morning to call for at least a six-month delay in the 2016 Brazil Summer Olympics, due to the Zika virus outbreak.Noting that he was not an alarmist by nature, Dr. Caplan said he thought the Zika threat has been underestimated by health authorities around the world, including those in the United States.""You've got this outbreak going on, and you're going to expose hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, who go down there to attend the Olympics or participate in them,"" he warned. ""We don't have a cure, we don't have a vaccine, there is now a couple of cases that have been reported about transmission of the virus into the blood supply, we don't have a good test for that why would we be trying to run an Olympics in a country that is straining, anyway?""Caplan noted that Zika originated in Africa, but was brought to the current South American outbreak zone by travelers over the past few decades. A huge number of travelers entering Brazil for the Olympics and then returning home would present a large risk of Zika migrating to new areas, where it could be spread through local populations by mosquito bites, possibly through sexual contact, or contaminate the blood supply, as Caplan warned. Breitbart News host Stephen K. Bannon noted that Brazil has not canceled the Carnaval celebration, which will also attract a sizable number of international travelers.Asked why governments and international health agencies are not taking the Zika outbreak seriously enough to consider postponing or suspending these public events, Caplan replied, ""Business, money, investment in the infrastructure.""""I'm not cynical, but that's the only explanation I've got for you,"" he said, as Bannon noted the enormous amount of investment and profit in the Olympic Games, by everyone from local businesses to international news organizations.Caplan's advice was to ""get six months, get nine months, postpone this - it's not like the thing has to happen in August. Develop a good diagnostic test. Get something that lets us test the blood supply. Make sure that we've killed all the mosquitoes. You know - let's use some common sense here.""Bannon compared such a postponement to the delay of the Ryder Cup after the 9/11 terror attacks. Caplan agreed with the example and asked, if the Olympics are held on schedule: ""Are you gonna round up the family, and the teenage daughters, and say: 'Hey, let's go watch the discus throw in the middle of a Zika epidemic?'""The degree of uncertainty around Zika is major component of its threat profile, as Caplan explained. There is still much that is not known about the virus, including the reason it suddenly became so much more aggressive during the current outbreak, and the exact nature of its relationship to the severe neurological reaction in produces in some victims, or the birth defects it has been associated with. Caplan mentioned the possibility that the virus has mutated, and could mutate again, as well as the danger of introducing it into new populations with very little natural immunity.""I think the biggest threat is getting it into the blood supply,"" he said of the menace Zika poses to the American population. ""You've got people traveling down there, they come back, they're not symptomatic, or they're not female - they're not going to have a kid with birth defects you put that in the blood supply, and you're exposing a lot of women who will have children to the virus. That's something that really worries me.""In the current situation, Caplan's recommendation for protecting the blood supply was simple: ""If you've been in those countries, don't donate blood."" He said local blood clinics should begin taking steps to screen out travelers to the Zika outbreak region immediately, ""today.""   ","breitbart","right","16836","zika",647
"The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) confirmed 10 cases of the Zika virus statewide on Wednesday while the latest number of reported cases continues to climb.The latest statistics show seven cases in Harris County (Houston), one in Bexar County (San Antonio), and two in Dallas County (Dallas) where Tuesday, health officials announced the first case of the Zika virus being sexually-transmitted in the United States. The second case in Dallas County accounts for ""patient zero,"" the individual who contracted the virus on recent travel to Venezuela and then, once back in Dallas, transmitted the virus through sexual contact to a partner.Sexual transmission of the virus raised concerns about how the virus spreads. Dallas ABC-TV affiliate WFAA 8 reported that while scientists continue to study if the virus was transmitted through blood or semen, the findings of this research could result in ""two very different things."" Currently, the two Dallas Zika patients are not quarantined because Dallas County health officials maintain Zika virus symptoms are mild and non-life threatening. ""Patient zero"" was, however, asked to refrain from sexual contact with any other people. The person who contracted Zika virus through sexual contact is reportedly not pregnant.Texas Health Dallas Epidemiologist Dr. Edward Goodman commented: ""If a person is traveling to one of those 26 countries that have been declared by the Pan American and World Health organizations to be transmitting the diseasethey should use condoms for their sexual contacts until they are well beyond the period where they could have acquired (Zika virus) or transmitted it."" He added that the incubation period is approximately one to two weeks and if a person is back three or four weeks, he or she is likely ""not at risk"" anymore.However, those considered most at risk from Zika virus remain pregnant women and women trying to conceive because of the suspected link to serious birth defects, most notably, microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with small heads and deformed brains. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus a ""global health emergency"" because of these suspected gestational abnormalities. Incidences increased during Brazil's 2015 Zika virus outbreak. The CDC continues to advise pregnant women, as well as all individuals, that the best way to protect themselves from Zika virus is by avoiding travel to the affected countries with high rates of Zika virus.University of Texas Southwestern and Children's Hospital's Dr. Jeffrey Kahn told NBC DFW that infected people could infect the mosquitos and ""start the transmission cycle.""Although sexual transmission raises key concerns about the virus spreading, most officials remain concerned with local mosquitoes becoming infected by an individual diagnosed with the Zika virus. While there are no reports of the virus being spread by local mosquitoes, this kind of transmission is possible now that Zika virus is in Texas. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins feels better prepared for a potential local mosquito-borne Zika virus outbreak than in 2012 when West Nile virus hit, citing the county's plan to survey, trap, spray and eradicate affected Aedes mosquito populations. The same type of mosquito spreads Dengue fever and Chikungunya.The most common symptoms from Zika virus are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (pink eye) that can last from several days to a week. In Dallas, health officials ask residents with symptoms to visit their doctors if they have visited an area where Zika virus is prevalent or if they had sexual contact with a person who recently traveled to a Zika affected area.Texas health department officials recommend ways to minimize mosquito bites, in general, such as using daily EPA-registered insect repellents that contain DEET plus permethrin-treated clothing and gear. They also advise wearing long, loose fitting and light-colored close when outside, removing all standing water in and around the exterior of the home, and limiting outdoor activities during dusk and dawn hours when mosquitoes are most active. on Twitter ","breitbart","right","16834","zika",658

And, once that occurs, it's almost impossible to get the virus out of the population.""KVUE reported on the new development for controlling mosquitoes:The professor told KVUE his team needs more money to complete a different variation of the gene that could be effective against more species of mosquitoes.Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and is a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.

"SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador on Thursday urged women in the Central American nation to avoid getting pregnant until 2018 to avoid their children developing birth defects from the mosquito-borne Zika virus which has rampaged through the Americas.The Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also known to carry the dengue, yellow fever and Chikungunya viruses. Health experts are unsure why the virus, which was first detected in Africa in 1947 but unknown in the Americas until last year, is spreading so rapidly in Brazil and neighboring countries.Although research is still underway, significant evidence in Brazil shows a link between Zika infections and rising cases of microcephaly, a neurological disorder in which infants are born with smaller craniums and brains.""We'd like to suggest to all the women of fertile age that they take steps to plan their pregnancies, and avoid getting pregnant between this year and next,"" said Deputy Health Minister Eduardo Espinoza.He said the government decided to make the announcement because 5,397 cases of the Zika virus had been detected in El Salvador in 2015 and the first few days of this year.Official figures show 96 pregnant women are suspected of having contracted the virus, but so far none have had babies born with microcephaly.In Colombia, which has the second-highest Zika infection rate after Brazil, the government is also advising women to delay becoming pregnant, but only for six to eight months.(Reporting by Nelson Renteria; Writing by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Richard Chang) ","huffingtonpost","left","16822","zika",279
"The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced that doctors had confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly, a rare birth defect.""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC Director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of claiming Zika caused the microcephaly, a disorder in which the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth and results in a small head. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the Zika outbreak, however, Brazil has documented over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.Doctors reported 404 cases of microcephaly in newborns since November. They tied seventeen ""to the Zika virus."" Fifteen of the 404 passed away, ""with five linked to Zika."" Authorities are investigating 56 other deaths and 3,670 cases.Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations in the Western Hemisphere have recorded populations of the mosquito species living there (Chile and Canada are the exceptions). They also carry dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya. Doctors found Zika in one infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia have advised women against getting pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.Yale University School of Public Health Professor Albert Ko claims the cases of microcephaly in Brazil are just the start of concerns about birth defects linked to the Zika virus.""It seems like microcephaly may just be the tip of the iceberg,"" he stressed, adding:Microcephaly has received the most attention, but Ko found other problems with the infants.""We're seeing a spectrum. Many have fairly severe central nervous system lesions,"" he explained. ""There are also a lot of calcium deposits  Those can cause seizures and cause impairment in terms of function for the brain.""He added, ""We're also seeing that in some babies, the brains, which usually have wrinkles, are actually smooth.

"Photo: Facebook page of Déjala Decidir, march for decriminalization of abortion, Perú 2015.After more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly- the congenital condition associated with incomplete brain development- in Brazil, around 2,100 in Colombia and many on the rise in the rest of Latin America, Zika has just been declared a public health emergency by the WHO. Public health experts agree that contraception and abortion are two of the best tools for combating the consequences of the Zika virus outbreak, however most Latin American nations prefer to be guided by Christian credo rather than concern for the health of its people, making contraception largely unavailable, penalizing abortion and deciding on the destiny of thousands of women and their families.It is time that Latin American governments start treating the currently unavoidable issue of abortion as an issue of public health rather than one of conservative religious beliefs, and it is the perfect moment for reproductive rights activists to step up, organize and demand action against the ludicrous responses their governments have to a crisis that will affect those infected for the rest of their lives.Most countries in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and southern Asia have severe abortion laws. Those range from 2-6 years of imprisonment in the Philippines to a 30-year prison sentence in El Salvador. Given these country's poor health systems and the unavailability of access to safe abortion, even women with life-threatening pregnancies need to risk their life either by carrying the pregnancy to term or by choosing an unsafe abortion.Photo: Facebook page of Déjala Decidir, march for decriminalization of abortion, Perú 2015. ""I decide over my body"" El Salvador, Nicaragua, Chile and the Dominican Republic all ban abortion without exception or consideration for victims of rape, fetal anomaly or the mother's health.  And whereas the better answer to this health emergency surely lies in a vaccine against Zika, that answer is simply not available as of today. Yet governments like the one in El Salvador tend to make it sound as if the solution is on its way by telling women to simply wait with pregnancies until 2018.Not only is the international community far from a solution at this point, but postponing pregnancies is no option for many women in Latin America even if they wanted to.  A poor woman living in a rural area of her country- whether that is Brasil or Colombia- is not only more susceptible to the virus (due to the tropical climate and the financial inaccessibility of insect repellent) but she is usually not sufficiently informed about contraceptive methods let alone able to obtain them (legally).  This is why Zika -just like most infectious diseases- is again a disease that will most likely target the poor disproportionately. Unlike some other infections, a pregnant woman that contracted Zika will suffer from its effects for the rest of her life. She will need to take care of a child most likely disabled in his/her's mental and/or physical abilities with limited resources, bad access to specialized healthcare and little knowledge about the condition her child was born with. If the governments of those Latin American countries affected do not change their abortion laws in the face of this crisis, chances are high that Zika will not only force nations to deal with thousands of disabled infants but that governments will also have thousands of women's deaths on their conscience due to unsafe abortions. Photo: Chola Contravisual The paradox within Latin America is that many of its countries advocate health as a human right. They claim that every single member of society should obtain the services he or she requires to thrive in good health, both physical and mental. Yet it is also Latin American countries such as Ecuador that despite their progressive governments do not seem to acknowledge that a woman's reproductive choice is part of this right. Data from 2008 suggests that 13% of worldwide maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortions. These are tens of thousands of women who die because their governments, communities or religious circles deprive them of making their own reproductive decisions. Criminalizing abortion is putting thousands of lives at risk every day and it does not reduce the likelihood that women facing an unplanned pregnancy will seek abortion services.  All they do is compel women to risk their lives by seeking out unsafe abortions.  As the WHO noted in its 2008 report on unsafe abortions ""safe abortion has become a privilege of the rich, while poor women have little choice but to resort to unsafe providers."" This is why more than 80% of unsafe abortions take place in developing countries with Latin America leading the list with 30 or more per 1000 women being forced to turn to bad solutions to a problem easily solved in rich countries and by committed governments. Photo: Facebook page of Déjala Decidir, pro-choice event at the Lima courthouse, 2015. Activists on the ground need to grasp this moment and fight this trend. Multiple organizations all over Latin America are already doing their part by demanding from their governments to primarily make contraceptives and early-screening test accessible so that women have the tools they need to postpone pregnancies or once already pregnant, to consider a safe and informed abortion. Women in both urban and rural areas need to be empowered to defend this human right and to decide themselves when to have a child.The evidence suggests that abortions can be reduced when women are allowed contraception, when women are educated about family planning and when abortion clinics are available and financially accessible (liberalizing laws is not enough if abortion services are not made accessible in practice). Even in countries where abortion is not punished by law, women often have severely limited access because of political will.Latin American governments need to stop criminalizing women's preferences for how to live their lives and acknowledge that a woman's reproductive choices are part of the right to health many leaders so proudly advocate for all its citizens. Next to contraception the discussion will sooner or later always include the right to abortion. A first step in light of the crisis Zika puts us into would be to advocate for abortion rights in case of fetal anomaly. Activists in Brazil have proven in 2012 that given the right amount of pressure governments can loosen abortion restrictions in cases of anomalies.  It's time to show affected women all over Latin America that they do not need to face this crisis alone.","huffingtonpost","left","16833","zika",1101
"The scene in Guatemala, soon to be repeated here?This week, the Senate did something. It passed Zika prevention and research funding, but it passed it as an amendment to a larger spending bill. An effort by Senate Democrats to pass stand-alone Zika funding was blocked by Republicans, who point to the amendments in the spending bill they passed as adequate. Never mind that this spending bill will likely never make it through the House, which doesn't really want to do anything about Zika at all. The Republican House is content to basically say it approves of the Ebola funding that the administration has raided to start the Zika fight-and wants to replace-and there won't be any more money. This, they say, is funding Zika.Meanwhile, this is getting deadly serious.(CNN)The number of pregnant women with the Zika virus in the United States has more than tripled, increasing from 48 to 157, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.It's unclear whether the increase is because there are more pregnant women with the virus or if officials are now keeping track of them in a different way-or a combination of the two.That's 157 cases ""with any laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection."" But it's only those reported through May 12, so it's a week behind. There's an additional 122 pregnant women showing possible infection in American territories. At this point, all of the cases in the US-544 of them, total-are travel related. One has resulted in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Mosquitoes, though, don't have any respect for the borders of the U.S. They are coming and very soon there will be locally acquired cases. And there will be babies born with terrible birth defects. Which Republicans don't seem to give a shit about.","dailykos","left","16941","zika",298
"Microcephaly, babies born with small heads and underdeveloped brains, is one of the grim consequences that has been laid at the feet of the Zika viral outbreak.The possible link between Zika and these birth defects is not well understood. Some critics have speculated that microcephaly is actually caused by heavy pesticide spraying in nations such as Brazil. Both Brazilian authorities and the World Health Organization have now denied there is any link between the pesticide Pyriproxyfen and microcephaly.CNN reports that a group of Argentinian doctors advanced the claim that Pyriproxyfen - which is more specifically a larvicide, designed to kill mosquito larvae growing in potable water - might be the culprit behind the surge of microcephaly in Brazil. One Brazilian state, Rio Grande do Sul, banned the larvicide last weekend as a result.The Argentinian doctors also criticized the Brazilian Ministry of Health for being too quick to blame Zika for the surge in birth defects.Pyriproxyfen's Japanese manufacturer, Sumitomo Chemical, said the accusations about its product were ""totally unfounded,"" pointing to its 20-year history of safe use in countries around the world.The Brazilian Health Ministry agreed, saying there are ""no epidemiological studies showing the association between the use of Pyriproxyfen and microcephaly."" The ministry further defended the tests which established the Zika linkage and noted that Zika-linked microcephaly has been reported in areas that don't use Pyriproxyfen. One of those areas is the coastal city of Recife, considered ""ground zero"" of the Zika outbreak.The World Health Organization agreed, pointing out that Pyriproxyfen is one of 12 larvicides it has officially approved for the control of mosquito populations, and concluding there is no evidence to support a link to microcephaly.Business Insider cited the statements from Brazilian and WHO officials in response to viral Internet rumors portraying the larvicide as the true cause of the Zika-linked microcephaly epidemic. BI quotes experts saying that Pyriproxyfen interferes with hormones that do not exist in humans, is quickly flushed from animal bodies, and would have to be consumed in ridiculous volumes to become toxic in humans: the equivalent of drinking over 1,000 liters of larvicide-treated water per day.Business Insider also observes these viral Internet memes implicate the huge Monsanto agricultural company in a conspiracy to conceal the dangers of Pyriproxifen, but Monsanto is merely a partner of the Sumitomo corporation, not its owner, and does not manufacture larvicides.Despite these statements, the secretary of health for Rio Grande do Sul, Joao Gabbardo dos Reis, said the ban on Pryiproxyfen would remain in place. ""The suspicion is enough to make us decide to suspend use. We cannot take that risk,"" Gabbardo said.That decision could have horrific results for residents of the state.""The potential human health consequences of discouraging the use of Pyriproxyfen in drinking water storage and other mosquito-reduction programs is catastrophic, with potential deaths and serious disease from otherwise avoidable malaria, dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases numbered in at least the hundreds of thousands,"" warned Australian toxicology consultant Andrew Bartholomaeus, who works with the Universities of Cnaberra and Queensland, as quoted by Business Insider.","breitbart","right","16848","zika",520

""We don't know the true incidence among pregnant women.""As CNSNews.com reports, Sheffield added:She continued that for those babies who test positive for Zika, ""how many of them are actually going to one, have symptoms and two, what are the long term consequences?

We have no idea.""Despite the lack of scientific knowledge about the Zika virus' effects on unborn children during pregnancy, Planned Parenthood has demanded even more taxpayer funding along with claims that only the abortion giant can fight Zika with birth control and abortion as its weapons.""We are the front line of defense when it comes to battling Zika,"" Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said, criticizing Republicans who refused to provide additional funding to the abortion giant in a $1.1 billion measure to combat Zika.Laguens said it was ""shameful"" for Republicans ""to undermine the ability of family planning providers like Planned Parenthood to do what we do best in the midst of this rapidly spreading Zika virus, a public health crisis that directly targets women and children.""Senate Democrats blocked the GOP funding bill because it stripped out more funding for Planned Parenthood. President Barack Obama is still urging approval for his $1.9 billion proposal and had threatened to veto the GOP bill if it had passed the Senate.""They restrict funding for birth control provided by Planned Parenthood. Can you believe that?"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said, according to CNN. ""And the Zika problem, who does it affect? Women and especially pregnant women.""""The bill passed by House Republicans doesn't recognize Zika as a public health emergency,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), reports Roll Call. ""It nickels and dimes our efforts to respond. It makes it more difficult for women to access birth control. And it waives safety rules for the use of pesticides.""As Breitbart News has reported, Planned Parenthood has been taking advantage of worries surrounding the Zika virus and the birth defect known as microcephaly that has been linked with the virus. The abortion giant is particularly targeting Latin American countries that have restrictive abortion laws, in hopes of capitalizing on women's fears and changing those laws.However, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stressed in testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that it was ""too soon"" to be advising women about birth defects that might be linked to the Zika virus because little is known now about the effects of the virus on an unborn child.""We've had examples where the ultrasounds were looking okay but the baby wasn't okay and others where there seemed to be problems and then the baby turned out to be okay,"" explained Rear Adm. Anne Schuchat, M.D. ""I think it's too soon for us to have a very confident set of information to counsel women with about just what to expect and how to plan.""At the Capitol Hill briefing, Dr. Catherine Y. Spong, acting director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIHCD), also stressed the need for more information on the Zika virus in pregnancy particularly from areas such as Puerto RIco and Brazil which are experiencing active local transmission of the virus.""We need a lot of information about Zika, and some of that we can best get through animal models, and some of that we can only get through a large cohort study, so both are absolutely essential,"" Spong said. ""We need to understand and be able to counsel the women who we see in our practices, what is the risk in pregnancy?""The Zika virus is actually an old problem, one that Brazil successfully fought with the pesticide DDT in the past.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), explained recently that during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil eliminated the mosquito carrying the Zika virus through the use of DDT.Fauci said that Brazil was able to stop the spread of Zika through ""a very aggressive attempt"" to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus and is ""a very difficult mosquito to control and eliminate.""Despite their expressed concern about the spread of Zika, Democrats rejected a bill that would end a redundant Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permit requirement to spray federally approved pesticides into bodies of water to combat the mosquito that carries the Zika virus.Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told Breitbart News recently that, in fact, the government should wipe the virus out completely by lifting the ban on DDT.""DDT was the most effective public health weapon of all time,"" she explained, adding:""Substitute pesticides are far more toxic and expensive,"" Orient continues. ""People are advised to use insect repellents such as DEET - which is absorbed through the skin, and safety in pregnancy is not established.""Pioneer Energy president, Dr. Robert Zubrin, recently echoed the same idea at National Review: ""The most effective pesticide is DDT. If the Zika catastrophe is to be prevented in time, we need to use it.""""Rachel Carson  in her 1962 book, Silent Spring, made an eloquent case that DDT was endangering bird populations,"" he explained. ""This was false. In fact, by eliminating their insect parasites and infection agents, DDT was helping bird numbers to grow significantly.""""No matter. Using Carson's book and even more wild writing by Population Bomb author Paul Ehrlich (who in a 1969 Ramparts article predicted that pesticides would cause all life in the Earth's oceans to die by 1979), a massive propaganda campaign was launched to ban DDT,"" Zubrin wrote.According to The Hill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to bring up the $1.1. billion package for another vote this week before the Senate's summer recess.","breitbart","right","16988","zika",1080
"The chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will head to Puerto Rico in coming days to get a firsthand look at the U.S. territory's response to the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease linked to serious birth defects.CDC officials say the island, already beleaguered by a debt crisis that threatens basic health care services for its 3.5 million residents, has recorded more than 100 cases of infection.Researchers worry that number could balloon to hundreds of thousands of cases, based on the island's history with related viruses carried by Zika's primary vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito.CDC Director Tom Frieden will meet with public health officials and emphasize the need to protect pregnant women. That's because evidence from hard-hit Brazil and other Latin American countries suggests a link between Zika and microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with abnormally small heads.President Obama has requested $1.9 billion from Congress to address the Zika outbreak at home and abroad.The request includes $250 million to bolster Puerto Rico's Medicaid program, since its funding is capped and the island theoretically cannot respond as easily to emergencies.Dr. Frieden's tour will be the administration's second high-profile visit to the island this year, after Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew met with local officials to discuss the island's $70 billion debt.House Republican leaders are forging a response to the debt crisis by March 31. But on Zika, they have told the White House to use leftover Ebola funds before it requests nearly $2 billion more in spending.Puerto Rico has dealt with outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya, a pair of viruses related to Zika.Dr. Frieden will check in with the CDC's dengue lab on the island, which is starting to test for Zika.""For the commonwealth of Puerto Rico as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa, a surge in resources is urgently needed,"" Dr. Frieden told the House Energy and Commerce Committee last week. ""The population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is widespread on these islands, protective environmental factors such as window screens are not as prominent, and the density of people puts people there at high risk for transmission.""Zika is not transmitting locally in the 50 states, though travelers returning from Latin America have brought the virus back with them.Scientists say the dynamic could change as temperatures rise, making conditions more hospitable to disease-carrying mosquitoes in the Southern states.The CDC said Friday that it would bring state, federal and local officials together April 1 for a one-day summit on the Zika virus at its headquarters in Atlanta.""Participants will hear the latest scientific knowledge about Zika, including implications for pregnant women and strategies for mosquito control,"" the CDC said. ""This meeting will also provide an opportunity to increase knowledge of best communications practices and identify possible gaps in preparedness and response at the federal, state, and local levels and help begin to address possible gaps."" ","washingtontimes","right","16864","zika",492
"The Brazilian government moved Friday to attack mosquito hot spots in federal buildings across the country, part of its effort to ""declare war"" on insects that are carrying the Zika virus across Latin America.Health Minister Marcelo Castro encouraged workers to wipe out standing water in gutters, trash cans or even plastic cups - places where the Aedes mosquito can breed.""This battle we will win, because a mosquito is no stronger than a whole country,"" Mr. Castro said.Brazil has reported up to 1 million cases of Zika, a virus that only circulated in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region until it showed up in the Americas last year.Though only one in five infected persons will show symptoms, Zika virus has been tied to microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads, and a condition known as Guillian-Barre, which can lead to temporary paralysis.Brazil has reported about 4,000 cases of microcephaly over the past several months. Not all cases have been verified, however, and the link to Zika has not been proven.Experts said the federal cleanup is a positive step, but wiping out the virus and its breeding grounds will be a unique challenge for Latin America.""It's a start, but it's a herculean task. Most of these countries are in emerging markets - or if not, close to it - and they just don't have the resources to do it,"" said Dr. Robert Quigley, senior vice president for medical assistance at International SOS, a company that advises clients on global medical and security issues.The World Health Organization will convene an emergency meeting Monday in Geneva to discuss the Zika crisis. Its chief said the virus is ""spreading explosively"" and now affects more than 20 nations in Latin America.Officials in El Salvador are so worried that they've asked women to try and avoid becoming pregnant until 2018, according to multiple new reports.Zika isn't transmitting in the continental U.S., but it has shown up in returning travelers and spread in Puerto Rico. A potential vaccine won't be available for years to come, though scientists are working on an emergency version.In the meantime, the Centers for Disease Control has advised pregnant women not to travel to Zika-affected countries.The administration says the mosquitoes that carry the virus will struggle to survive in the U.S. for now, given low January temperatures in much of the country.Brazil is steeped in its summer, however, so the climate is more hospitable to the insect vectors. That dynamic will flip by August, when Rio de Janeiro is scheduled to host the Olympic Games amid its winter.While that's good for the host country, experts are worried about the virus will catch a ride to other corners of the globe.""There's going to be such a potential influx of foreigners who will be returning to their respective countries, many of whom are returning in their summer months,"" Dr. Quigley said.""It's a big deal,"" he said. ","washingtontimes","right","16829","zika",499

"A Honduran woman infected with the rapidly spreading Zika virus gave birth to a baby with microcephaly, a severe birth defect linked to the virus, in New Jersey on Tuesday, The Record reported. The birth is the first reported case in the continental United States of the Zika-caused condition. The baby was born with a low birth weight of less than six pounds, an abnormally small head, and severe intestinal and visual issues, said Dr. Manny Alvarez, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the Hackensack University Medical Center. Alvarez said the mother appeared to be devastated after the Cesarean section. ""You could see the pain in her heart,"" he said, according to The Record.The New Jersey mother, who was not identified, reportedly contracted the Zika virus after a mosquito bit her when she visited her home country of Honduras during the early stages of her pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control reports that there have been 591 cases of Zika diagnosed in the United States, but the only known case of a baby born with microcephaly from the virus occurred in Hawaii earlier this year. The virus is typically spread by a mosquitos, but can also be transmitted through sexual contact.The CDC has requested $1.9 billion in funding to deal with the Zika epidemic, which is spreading rapidly throughout South and Central America and becoming an urgent threat to the continental U.S. as the weather warms up and becomes more mosquito-friendly. But Congress failed last week to pass a bill to give health officials the money they need, and then left the Capitol for a 10-day recess. CDC Director Tom Frieden begged Congress on Thursday to stop bickering over the financial details and move on Zika before it's too late. ""Imagine that you're standing by and you see someone drowning, and you have the ability to stop them from drowning, but you can't,"" Frieden told reporters and potential donors at the National Press Club.

"Republican candidates for president share the ideology that there is no role -- or only a limited one -- for the government in regulating the environment. The GOP's principal target -- strongly supported by funding from the Koch Brothers and the message machinery of Fox News -- is the US Environmental Protection Agency. Now that the alarming spread of the Zika virus is on par with media coverage of the GOP presidential popularity contest, here are four questions for GOP presidential candidates.In a short period of weeks, the mosquito-borne Zika virus has ""explosively"" spread through the Americas and into the public consciousness. The virus can cause fetuses to grow micro encephalic brains. Question 1) The virus will spread into the United States according to health officials. Do you, GOP candidate, support intervention by federal agencies to protect the American people, including children and infants otherwise neglected by federal toxic standards?Question 2) If you do, please explain why?Mercury pollution is pervasive in American freshwater wetlands like the Everglades, but it is poorly regulated by the states and federal government. In its toxic form, mercury is a severe threat to fetuses and to brain development in children, like the Zika virus. Question 3) Do you support intervention by federal agencies to monitor and to regulate drinking water quality -- the main pathway for mercury -- by federal agencies including the US EPA? (In fact, the GOP Congress and its supporters in states like Florida, including the Chamber of Commerce, Associated Industries of Florida and the Farm Bureau, wage a perpetual campaign against strengthening rules and laws by federal agencies to protect water quality.)Question 4) If you support a federal role in preventing the spread and the consequences for the Zika virus but not federal responsibility to tighten toxic mercury, monitoring and enforcement of protections for our drinking water, please explain why?","huffingtonpost","left","16834","zika",322
"WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats tried and failed Wednesday to expedite emergency funds to combat the Zika virus, stymied by Republicans who objected and tried to extract cuts to Obamacare as a condition for their agreement.Using procedural tactics, Democrats tried to force two votes by unanimous consent: one to approve the $1.9 billion sought by the Obama administration, and another requesting to speed up passage of a $1.1 billion measure that senators backed Tuesday.The moves were meant to pressure Republicans, and to once again put them on the record against the president's larger emergency request to deal with the virus, which causes birth defects such as microcephaly and other ailments. It came one day after the Senate voted 68-29 to provide that $1.1 billion in emergency Zika funds as part of a larger spending bill for transportation, housing and military construction projects.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) took to the floor Wednesday to argue that the larger bill could easily get tied up in Congress' dysfunctional process, and be stalled until the fall -- well after the money will be needed. The Zika spending should be broken out, they argued.""As the weather warms, the mosquitoes will multiply and people will be bitten by these vicious little insects,"" Reid said. ""The appropriations process -- to say it is slow is a gross understatement. We need to get this done now.""Part of Democrats' concerns stem from the legislation House Republicans are currently considering -- $622 million redirected from previously authorized Ebola funds and other programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) argues that the House proposal should be seen as an addition to the roughly $600 million the White House has already transferred from its Ebola response. In any case, the House and Senate proposals are different, and the Senate's is currently tied to a spending bill, which could require a conference committee process to work out the differences.""So how are we going to take these things to conference when the House can't even come up with a budget?"" Reid said, tweaking Ryan for his inability to get his members in line behind even a basic annual fiscal blueprint.After Reid's request to push through the president's full $1.9 billion was unsuccessful, Murray took a shot, calling for a vote on the $1.1 billion Zika deal she'd helped craft with Republicans, but as a standalone. ""There is no reason to keep it attached to the bill we're on and allow House Republicans to slow-walk it,"" Murray said. ""And there's no reason that this funding can't be approved and signed into law next week, in time for summer and the peak of mosquito season.""But Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) objected, and instead asked her to modify her request in a way that Republicans might prefer.""Would the senator modify her request to include my language... which has the exact same funding levels... but includes a pay-for using the prevention fund in the Affordable Care Act?"" Cornyn said, referring a part of Obamacare that aims to boost public health through preventive means, but that Republicans often target as a slush fund. (You can read more about the prevention fund here.)Murray objected to Cornyn's counteroffer, noting that the prevention fund helps keep women and infants healthy -- one of her same goals in pushing emergency Zika funding.""The agreement that the senator from Texas has just broached means that we're going to have to fight over cuts -- cuts to women, cuts to families, cuts to critical health care efforts in order to fight the Zika virus,"" Murray said. ""That is objectionable.""","huffingtonpost","left","16939","zika",627
"Like cockroaches, the conspiracy theorists suggesting the Zika virus outbreak is anything but a normal, naturally-occurring event have begun to come out of the woodwork. To be expected, the theories they're espousing make no sense scientifically, and each theory is incompatible with the others, but why should anyone expect that conspiracy theorists would actually use logic?Claim One: the current Zika virus outbreak is due to the release of genetically-modified mosquitoes by British company Oxitec. The suggestion is that GMO mosquitoes were released in the same area of Brazil now experiencing Zika outbreaks, and somehow these mosquitoes caused the outbreak. The mosquitoes are engineered to require the antibiotic tetracycline in order to survive development in the wild, so when a wild female mosquito breeds with a male GMO mosquitoe, it's essentially is a death sentence to the female's offspring. Theorists argue that livestock use of tetracycline leaves this antibiotic in the environment, allowing some offspring to survive. Somehow, Zika is inserted into this.Who's claiming this? Stories at Natural News, the Daily Mirror, The Ecologist, and Antimedia, among others. Alex Jones brings in the Bill Gates connection.What's wrong with it? There's absolutely nothing that makes sense to relate this to Zika. Even if these GMO mosquitoes can reproduce, that doesn't mean they're suddenly infected with the Zika virus. This article probably lays it out the best as far as a suggested mechanism, but even then it's a convoluted mess, suggesting a transposon* (a ""jumping gene"") moved from the mosquito into Zika virus (but where did the Zika come from in the first place though? was it already in Brazil?), then that transposon made Zika more virulent and gave the virus ""an enhanced ability to enter and disrupt human DNA"" (what??), which then leads to microcephaly. All without absolutely any citations from the scientific literature to back up this scenario, of course.And that's even assuming that the area where the testing occurred was the same as where the mosquitoes were released. It's not, as both The Mad Virologist and Christie Wilcox point out. Both have many more details taking down this theory as well.Claim Two: a program encouraging pregnant women to get the Tdap vaccine led to the presumed increase in microcephaly in Brazilian babies. Because, toxins?Who's claiming this? Really credible places, like Brazilian Shrunken Head Babies (not even joking).What's wrong with it? Pretty much everything. First, the vaccine isn't recommended until relatively late in pregnancy; even one of the links cited by the ""shrunken heads"" page notes that it's suggested in the 27th to 36th week of pregnancy. This is very late in pregnancy to have such a severe effect on brain/skull development. For other microbes that cause microcephaly (such as cytomegalovirus or rubella), infection occurring in the first half of the pregnancy (before 20 weeks) is usually associated with a higher likelihood of adverse developmental outcomes, not one very late like Tdap. And of course, this theory completely contradicts the ""Zika-GMO mosquito"" one, which suggests that Zika is the cause.Biologically, this makes zero sense and furthermore, why wouldn't other countries be seeing this spike, if Tdap is truly the cause? Women in the U.S. and other countries also receive this vaccine during pregnancy, but we haven't seen an increase in microcephaly cases. Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated yet again that Tdap is very safe during pregnancy.Claim Three: Rockefeller something something bioterrorism something, maybe. They've taken the fact that an organization, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), has Zika virus available on their website, and twisted that into apparently some kind of deliberate release, maybe? It's all pretty shadowy. [Updated: this site very clearly says the Rockefellers invented it to kill people. If that were true, they did a pretty shitty job].Who's claiming this? Chemtrails Global Skywatch and The Freethought Project.What's wrong with it? Even the Freethought Project post basically unravels its own conspiracy theory, but still posted this for some reason, noting ""It seems that while the virus is available online, it is not extremely easy to get, and would likely require some extremely creative fraud in order to make it happen,"" but concluding that ""...it definitely does seem that it would be possible for a group or individual that is determined enough to make their way through the website's security measures.""I seriously doubt that.For those of you who don't know, ATCC is basically a global clearinghouse for biological samples-they offer tissue culture lines, bacteria, viruses, etc. Researchers need these for a number of reasons, such as having positive controls for assays, or to be sure they're using the same cells as another investigator whose work they want to replicate or expand upon. I've used them many times to get both bacteriophage as well as isolates of bacteria for my research projects. And they won't ship to just some random person.When I moved institutions and set up my new laboratory, on my first ATCC order, they contacted the director of biosafety at my institution to be sure my lab was equipped and ready to handle the organisms I had requested. When that was assured, we still had to establish a Material Transfer Agreement in order for the items to actually be shipped-a legal document between ATCC and my university, signed by an ""authorized representative"" of my institution. It was only after jumping through all of these hoops that I was finally able to get the requested samples.Even if someone had chosen to order Zika, an obscure, mostly-asymptomatic virus that until this outbreak was not associated with any serious ill effects, and perpetuated the ""extremely creative fraud"" mentioned by the Freethought Project...why? They'd need to initially infect themselves or others in order for the mosquitoes to subsequently become competent vectors of the virus. The mosquitoes would feed on them when there was adequate virus in the blood, and presumably the insects would then be released-to what end? To spread a previously-thought-relatively-harmless virus into a new population? Again, nonsensical.[Updated: this doesn't mean that ""Rockefeller owns the patent on Zika virus,"" as sites like this are claiming. As far as I can ascertain, there are no patents involving Zika. What it means is that the virus was deposited by Jordi Casals, who was an eminent virologist and had a large collection of viruses that he accumulated throughout his career, including Zika (but many others, as a search of ATCC shows). Rockefeller makes no money on this-in fact, now some journals require deposition of strains to ATCC or similar banks as a condition for publishing.]Claim four: Zika simply doesn't exist and/or isn't causing microcephaly, and the ""outbreak"" is a ploy to push the not-yet-extant Zika vaccine/get people to blindly obey the government. (hat tip to Mary Mangan for this one).Who's claiming this? HIV denier and anti-vax advocate Jon Rappoport, among others (another post of his here on the topic). A very common sentiment in the comments pages on anti-vaccine pages.What's wrong with it? Pretty much everything. Rappoport has made a meta-conspiracy theory, claiming the increase in microcephaly is caused not by Zika, but by a combination of pesticide use and manufacturing, the Tdap and GMO mosquitoes mentioned above, mosquito sprays, and poverty/sanitation/malnutrition (the boogeymen of every anti-vaccine advocate). While he's correct that the link between Zika and microcephaly isn't yet 100% confirmed (as I mentioned yesterday), he's taking at face value the claim that there actually is an increase in microcephaly at all-something which is also not been confirmed. So like many science deniers, he's taking the parts of the research that fit his biases (look at how toxic Brazil is! Of course it's causing health problems in babies!) and ignoring the parts he doesn't-that if there is an increase in microcephaly, Zika might be a driving force. In his mind, the virus is irrelevant and just a mechanism to make the public into ""sheep"" who will fall in line with government recommendations.I'm sure this will not be the last of the conspiracy theories. Like those we saw with Ebola, these have the potential to cause real harm. Outcry over the GMO mosquito program can curtail use of another agent to control the Aedes aegypti mosquito-the primary vector not only of Zika, but also yellow fever, chikungunya, and dengue. I know those who benefit from these type of conspiracies will never stop churning them out (Mike Adams, I'm looking at you), but we need to bring them to the light and show just how little scientific support any of this has. It won't inoculate everyone against these ideas, but hopefully it will provide enough community immunity that they're unable to spread far and wide.*Christie Wilcox pointed out another great observation on just how implausible this is-that the potential to insert a 8.4kb double-stranded DNA transposon into a 10.8kb single-stranded RNA virus is...not possible. So, yeah, just to add to the ridiculousness of that idea.*This blog previously appeared on Aetiology","huffingtonpost","left","16836","zika",1546
"Brazilian judge Jesseir Coelho de Alcantara has declared he will approve abortions for women who have contracted Zika and can prove their unborn child has microcephaly or ancenephaly. In Brazil, abortions are only legal with judicial approval.The ""microcephaly epidemic,"" as it is called in the BBC Brasil article, is reported to have affected at least 20 Brazilian states or more and the federal district.Ancenephaly is a condition in which a fetus is missing a portion of the brain, skull, or scalp. Microcephaly is defined as an abnormal smallness of the head, a congenital condition associated with incomplete brain development.As reported by BBC Brasil, Coelho de Alcantara deemed the termination of pregnancy in cases of microcephaly where there is a forecast of infant death ""valid,"" but added the situation ""needs to be evaluated 'case by case.'""Brazil has launched a door-to-door campaign executed by 220,000 soldiers to combat the spread of the Zika virus. The campaign launches as one of the nation's largest newspapers reports that medical experts have recorded more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly in the nation. Zika virus spreads through bites from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which also carries Dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya. The virus is common throughout Latin America and in the warmest parts of the rest of the hemisphere.While medical experts long believed Zika to be a mild viral infection, with symptoms resembling a weaker Dengue fever, Zika appears to be extremely dangerous to pregnant women. Brazilian authorities have documented thousands of cases of pregnant women diagnosed with Zika giving birth to babies with microcephaly, as reported by Martel. Children with microcephaly typically suffer severe mental damage.""If requested by any pregnant woman in this case, pregnant with microcephaly and Zika with medical evidence that this baby will be born alive, then yes, we authorize abortion,"" said the proprietor of the First Court of Crimes Against Life in Brazil's Goiânia region, which has allowed interruption of pregnancies in cases of syndromes Edwards and Body-Stalk, anomalies that would throttle the survival of the baby outside the womb,"" reports BBC Brasil.The Brazilian outlet reports that ""whether abortion is legal in cases of anencephalic fetuses, 'whose life after birth is impossible,' it is also justified in 'pregnancies in which the fetus proved to be born dead' due to microcephaly.""""Anencephaly and severe microcephaly, with death at birth, are similar cases,"" the BBC reported the Alcantara judge told them by telephone.

"A nominally Catholic abortion lobby group called Catholics for Choice has appealed to Pope Francis to permit Church members to procure abortions in good conscience as a means of eliminating the possibility of having children with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.According to Reuters, the Washington DC-based Catholics for Choice plans is running ads in the International New York Times and El Diario de Hoy in El Salvador on Thursday, just before the Pope embarks on his trip to Cuba and Mexico.""Women's decisions around pregnancy, including the decision to end a pregnancy, need to be respected, not condemned,"" the ad reads.The dissenting pro-abortion group was founded as ""Catholics for a Free Choice"" in 1973 by a former Catholic nun named Frances Kissling, who led the association for 25 years. The organization has been repeatedly repudiated by the bishops of the United States and Canada as a non-Catholic branch of the abortion lobby that has no right to use the name Catholic.In 2000, the US Bishops Conference published an official declaration noting that the organization ""is directed to rejection and distortion of Catholic teaching about the respect and protection due to defenseless unborn human life.""""On a number of occasions the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) has stated publicly that CFFC is not a Catholic organization, does not speak for the Catholic Church, and in fact promotes positions contrary to the teaching of the Church as articulated by the Holy See and the NCCB,"" the statement read.The bishops also stated that Catholics for Choice is an ""advocacy group dedicated to supporting abortion"" that is funded by ""a number of powerful and wealthy private foundations"" for the purpose of promoting abortion ""as a method of population control.""Despite this clear denunciation of the group, Reuters erroneously referred to the Catholics for Choice as a ""Roman Catholic group"" in its recent report, adding to the confusion surrounding the news.The push for easing restrictions on abortion comes in the wake of an announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, which said: ""Women who wish to terminate a pregnancy due to a fear of microcephaly should have access to safe abortion services to the full extent of the law.""Since the very first news of the outbreak of the Zika virus in Brazil, Planned Parenthood and other representatives of the abortion industry began bringing pressure to bear on Latin American governments to remove restrictions on abortion in their respective countries.The United Nations as well, which has a well-documented history of promoting abortion internationally as a means of population control, also weighed in on the crisis last week. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called for a relaxation of abortion laws in the nations where it is restricted.""The laws and policies that restrict access to these services should be urgently reviewed in accordance with human rights, in order to ensure, in practice, the right to health for all,"" he said.The Cardinal Archbishop of Lima, Peru, Juan Luis Cipriani, recently blasted the United Nations for suggesting that abortion was an apt solution to the Zika crisis, comparing the international organization to the biblical figure of King Herod, who ordered the slaughter of all male children under the age of two at the time of Jesus.""Today we are surrounded by Herods, but Herods with neckties, public posts and budgets,"" the Cardinal said, stating that ""the United Nations, in the face of this Zika mosquito virus, has decreed that we should approve abortion everywhere so as to kill the children.""""There is a Herod,"" he repeated, ""who thinks it's a good idea to decree an execution: let all pregnant women abort their babies because of a risk that hasn't even been conclusively shown.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The American Red Cross is relying on ""self-deferral"" to prevent its blood supply from being infected by the mosquito-borne Zika virus.""We believe that preventive steps like the implementation of the new self-deferral will help protect the U.S. blood supply from the potential introduction of Zika virus,"" Jodi Sheedy, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, told Breitbart News via email.Nevertheless, she warned, ""Most people with the Zika virus infection show no symptoms and, therefore, could attempt to donate blood even if they had been infected with the Zika virus.""An estimated 80 percent of Zika patients are asymptomatic.On Tuesday, the American Red Cross, a congressionally chartered non-profit, asked prospective donors who have traveled to the outbreak zones, such Latin America and the Caribbean, to wait at least 28 days before giving blood.""The information that will be provided to donors requesting their self-deferral for 28 days following return from an outbreak area is the best mitigation strategy that we can use currently to prevent collecting blood from potentially infected individuals,"" declared Sheedy.The 28-day period will ensure that the period of infectivity is over, according to the Red Cross.""This is the time period recommended by the AABB [American Association of Blood Banks], our professional association, and based on the best current scientific evidence,"" added the humanitarian institution's spokeswoman. ""While the maximum duration of this virus being present in the blood is unknown, it is believed to be approximately 7 days and thus 28 days provides an adequate safety level.""""In addition to the new 28-day self-deferral recommended by the AABB, the health history screening also helps to protect the blood supply,"" pointed out Sheedy. ""Donor screening consists of a temperature check, blood pressure, hemoglobin levels and a series of questions designed to ensure that a donor is healthy enough to donate and that his or her blood is as safe as possible for patients. We only collect blood from donors who are healthy and feeling well at the time of donation""The disaster relief agency noted that the risk of transmitting the virus through blood donations is ""extremely low"" in the continental United States.""It is important to note that due to the absence of local mosquito transmission, the risk of contracting Zika by blood transfusion in the continental U.S. at this time is believed to be extremely low,"" Sheedy told Breitbart News.""In the absence of local mosquito transmission, the number of infected persons is small to absent,"" she explained. ""The exception is the small number of travelers with Zika infection who have returned to the U.S. from areas experiencing outbreaks like Brazil.""Donors who have already given blood and have subsequently developed symptoms consistent with Zika are being asked to notify the Red Cross within 14 days so the product can be quarantined.""At this time, we have not received any calls from donors who are showing symptoms of Zika virus,"" notes Sheedy.""We also provide a call back number if the donor develops any symptoms of disease within the next several days following donation,"" she added. ""Donations from such donors are not used for transfusion.""On Thursday, Health officials in Brazil, the most Zika virus-affected country, confirmed two cases of transmission through blood transfusions from donors who had been infected with the virus.""The two reported cases in Brazil are under investigation and will provide further information regarding the risk of transmission of Zika by blood transfusion,"" pointed out the Red Cross spokeswoman.""Zika is usually contracted via mosquito bites, so transmission of the illness through blood transfusions adds another concern to efforts to contain the outbreak,"" reports Reuters. ""Some countries have tightened procedures for blood donations, to protect blood supplies.""Brazil's Health Ministry has reportedly instructed blood banks that people infected with Zika are not to be permitted to give blood for 30 days after full recovery from the active stage of Zika infection, adds the report.Canadian Blood Services has reportedly said that ""people who travel outside Canada, the continental U.S. and Europe won't be able to donate blood for 21 days after their return.""Zika has been linked to the neurological disorder known as microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads, and Guillain-Barré, a rare syndrome that causes the immune system to damage nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis.""The Red Cross continues to evaluate all emerging threats in collaboration with the FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] and CDC [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to determine what additional mitigation strategies are needed as the situation evolves,"" Sheedy told Breitbart News.Also causing anxiety is the possibility of Zika transmission through sexual contact. Texas health officials reported on Tuesday that an individual in Dallas contracted the disease after having sex with a person who had traveled to Venezuela, where the virus is also prominent.","breitbart","right","16835","zika",826
"By Drs. David Niesel and Norbert Herzog, Medical Discovery NewsHave you noticed in the past few years, we seem to be continuously assaulted by microbial menaces? Some years back it was SARS, which set off a global panic. People were screened for fevers at many major international airports. Then came the West Nile virus, which started from a single case in New York and in a matter of years marched across the U.S. Who can forget the avian flu or swine flu, which happened around the same time? More recently, the MERS virus has emerged, with outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula and then whole villages in Korea. We are just now reaching the end of the devastating Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Even if you're not an alarmist, it's hard to ignore the threat of these new microbial menaces.The latest is one that we are beginning to know well is Zika. While it sounds like the name of a modern Scandinavian rock band, this virus was first isolated in 1947 in Uganda. It emerged in the Pacific Islands before it spread to Brazil, and it's rapidly spreading through two dozen countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Now, cases of Zika have been confirmed in the U.S. and Europe in people who have recently traveled to an outbreak area where the virus is spreading.  Individuals can also become infected after direct contact with someone who has just returned from one of these areas. What makes public health officials in America highly concerned about this virus is that it is spread by mosquitoes called Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus that are common in the eastern and southeastern United States.  There is accumulating evidence that Zika infection in pregnant women leads to birth defects, most notably microcephaly. This means Zika could potentially threaten thousands of unborn fetuses. The images of the babies afflicted by this disorder, which causes abnormally small head sizes, are heartbreaking.  But the damage to babies born to a mother who was infected is not limited to this highly visible birth defect. There is emerging evidence that Zika can cause other neurological problems. In a recent study of 42 fetuses from women testing positive for Zika, 12 babies showed a range of neurological problems. Seven had lesions in the central nervous system, five had issues with brain development and an additional two were stillborn. The neurological lesions are devastating and lead to significant developmental issues. Mothers who become infected with Zika immediately become part of a high-risk pregnancy group. Evidence now suggests that Zika infection is associated with neurological disorders in children and adults as well.Most adults who become infected with the Zika virus don't experience symptoms, and it's usually mild for those that do. They have symptoms such as joint pain, fatigue and low fever, which usually last two to seven days. Some adults however can develop Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disorder. However, women who are pregnant or want to become pregnant in the near future should avoid Zika-infected areas, and men who've traveled to Zika-infected areas should refrain from unprotected sex for at least two months since the virus can be transmitted sexually. Currently, there are not any treatments or vaccines for Zika, so hang on, we are in for a bumpy ride this summer and beyond.Medical Discovery News is hosted by professors Norbert Herzog at Quinnipiac University, and David Niesel of the University of Texas Medical Branch.

"If you've been exposed to Zika virus and are trying to get pregnant, you should hold off on having sex, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday.The CDC released new pregnancy guidelines for anyone who's at even slight risk for the virus, which is suspected of causing birth defects and is currently spreading through South and Central America and the Caribbean. Men and women who traveled to Zika-affected areas but are not showing symptoms of the disease should wait eight weeks before trying to conceive, the CDC advises. Men who are showing symptoms or who have been diagnosed with the condition should wait longer: The CDC says men should hold off on having unprotected sex for six months, while women in the same situation are prescribed an eight-week waiting period. Zika is primarily mosquito-borne, but can also be transmitted from mother to fetus or newborn and from men to their sexual partners. The virus lasts longer in semen than in blood, a fact that surel influenced the updated guidelines for men. Symptoms of the virus are usually mild and short-lived and include fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes. But researchers suspect Zika can also cause certain neurological disorders and microcephaly, a birth defect that affects fetal brain development and may cause miscarriage, stillbirth or babies to be born with heads that are smaller than normal. ","huffingtonpost","left","16889","zika",255
"Scientists in Texas are the first to have successfully cloned the Zika virus. Experts at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston say the Zika clone can help in the development of an effective vaccine.The virus can now be created in laboratories. ""What we've created is something that is reproducible, meaning that batches of this virus can be made in large quantities,"" UTMB's Pei-Yong Shi told CNN.According to the published research paper, ""Unraveling the mechanisms causing increased viral transmissibility and disease severity requires experimental systems."" The medical institute reported the production of ""an infectious cDNA clone of ZIKV that was generated using a clinical isolate of the Asian lineage.""Scientists hope they will be able to create a vaccine after working with ""mouse and mosquito infection models.""Mosquitoes are rampant in the spring and outbreaks of any disease are more likely at that time. Economically depressed areas in Texas are potential dangerous breeding grounds.The danger of the virus in Texas and the states initially comes from travel to, or from those who have been in El Salvador, Brazil, and Columbia. These countries in particular have seen a huge outbreak of the virus. Breitbart News reported that Brazil launched a door-to-door campaign using 220,000 soldiers. There has been 4,000 fetus affected cases and approximately 200 more are diagnosed every week.Pregnant women and their unborn children are the most susceptible to the virus, as reported by Breitbart Texas.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a travel advisory and have warned pregnant women to not travel to Latin and Central America - areas that have been hit hard by the disease.Health authorities also ask that those returning from areas that have had an outbreak of the virus, be careful not to be bitten by mosquitoes even if they do not have symptoms, reported the The Dallas Morning News.Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

"Congress is finally answering the call to address the alarming infectious disease threat of the Zika Virus. However, the level of funding included in their recent votes is not close to enough. The effect will be particularly disastrous for local governments across the country. By refusing to fully support President Obama's request for $1.9 billion to fight the Zika virus, Congress is forcing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to shift nearly $45 million from state and local public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) funds to pay for Zika preparedness at the federal level. In turn, cities and counties are now facing substantial cuts to essential emergency preparedness funds--a deep irony, because these are the very funds that allow local health departments to prepare and respond to disease outbreaks and other emergencies. The implications for cutting emergency preparedness funding go far beyond Zika. When Baltimore was shaken by unrest last April, PHEP funds allowed us to take a lead role in coordinating the public health response for our city. Because of our emergency planning and response capabilities, the Health Department worked with city and state partners to create a security plan for Baltimore hospitals. When over 13 pharmacies were burned down or closed, we set up a prescription delivery program for older adults and vulnerable citizens. Our staff mobilized volunteers to canvas dozens of senior buildings and over 150 churches, and served more than 3,000 emergency meals to those affected in the community. With partners across the city, we developed and implemented a Mental Health/Recovery Plan that included an around-the-clock mental health crisis line along with teams of licensed mental health professionals who were deployed in affected neighborhoods for group counseling and debriefing. More recently, when our region was crippled by nearly three feet of snow in a historic storm this past January, it was again emergency preparedness funds that enabled Baltimore City to be the only jurisdiction in Maryland to ensure transportation to life-sustaining dialysis and chemotherapy treatment for critical patients by knowing how to triage available resources.  Like last April, we were again able to deploy frontline workers to go to where our residents were, quickly direct a multi-sectoral response in the face of a unique emergency situation, and act swiftly to protect our most vulnerable. Without these federal funds we could not have provided these critical emergency services to our residents during times of extreme need. This is the necessary role of local public health: to implement effective, agile strategies to address emerging threats to public welfare. Health departments across the country serve on the frontlines of public health emergencies. It was local public health that coordinated immediate trauma-based mental health services for a city reeling from the September 11th terrorist attacks. Local public health organized a drop-in center following the Boston marathon bombings to provide support to thousands of stranded runners and coordinated with area hospitals to connect patients with family members. And when Hurricane Katrina devastated the Mississippi Gulf Coast, including health facilities, local health departments provided direct health services to the region out of mobile vans and tents. Though my counterparts and I are proud to take a lead role in coordinating these efforts and providing direct services during emergencies, sustained federal funding is critical to ensuring that local health departments remain prepared to respond to evolving public health threats. The Baltimore City Health Department employs a small team to coordinate our public health emergency response and engage the community and health care sector in preparedness planning. Under these anticipated cuts, we will have to reduce that team by a third--from six to four people. This will severely limit our ability to serve a population of over 620,000 residents, in a time of increased threat of Zika and other emerging infections. When it comes to protecting the health and safety of our citizens, this is an untenable ratio. The World Health Organization and the CDC have declared Zika virus to be a public health emergency. We support full supplemental funding to prepare for this disease. It is particularly important to ensure capacity for our urban centers. The Aedes mosquito that carries Zika is a ""container breeder"" that proliferates in densely-populated urban areas. Cities like Baltimore with high rates of vacant housing and concentrated poverty will be the hardest hit, and generations of our children will suffer the consequences. Public health services need to be there when we need them most. Congress must strengthen, not limit, local capacity to respond to this emerging public health threat.","huffingtonpost","left","16975","zika",774
"The Zika outbreak is creating complicated situations in the workplace as bosses, employees and entrepreneurs try balancing health and safety with privacy rights.The virus, which spread across Latin America and the Caribbean last year, poses severe risks of birth defects in the offspring of pregnant women and couples who are trying to conceive. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns pregnant women not to travel any area with Zika, and advises other travelers to take measures to avoid mosquito bites and use a condom during sex.Employees may feel that in order to skip a business trip to a country affected by Zika, they'll have to reveal an early pregnancy or plans to conceive before they're ready to tell the boss. Before Zika, such conversations rarely occurred in the workplace.Georgia Beattie, 30, got trapped in just such an awkward situation last year. Beattie owns a successful wine company in Australia and had been invited to speak about entrepreneurship at a United Nations youth conference in Colombia. Though not pregnant, she declined the invitation after consulting with doctors, because she may choose to have a child in coming years.""There was part of me that thought that I was being overcautious and that I was giving up on an opportunity,"" said Beattie, who wants to expand her company into South America. It didn't help that others on the delegation didn't seem to consider Zika to be a legitimate health threat, according to Beattie.""The delegation was predominately men, and it was dampened down to not really be an issue,"" said Beattie. ""My reason for not going wasn't taken as seriously."" Business travelers, of course, have more opportunities to protect themselves from the mosquito-borne virus than the millions of people dwelling in the affected areas. Though there may be professional consequences, business travelers typically have the option of postponing a meeting or skipping a conference if they're uncomfortable with the risk.Still, the threat is real. So far, five babies born in the United States have had birth defects linked to travel to areas affected by Zika, and 265 pregnant women show evidence of an infection, according to the CDC.""Today"" show anchor Savannah Guthrie, who's pregnant and worried about contracting Zika, put a human face on the issue by publicly discussing her decision not to cover the upcoming Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, one of the worst-hit areas. Several athletes also announced they won't compete in Rio because of Zika. But many employees and bosses might grapple with how to make the decision, or even how to open a conversation. In some cases, a firm's clients need to be informed, too.That's what happened to Anne H., a 31-year-old graphic designer from Richmond, Virginia. She had been asked by her consulting firm to travel to Brazil to meet with clients in April, but learned in January that she was pregnant.""I wasn't ready to tell work that I was pregnant yet, because I had some issues early on in the pregnancy, so I just told [my manager] that we were trying and that I wasn't comfortable taking the risk,"" Anne said. ""My company is very flexible when it comes to balancing work [and] life, and I'm so incredibly appreciative that I could say I wasn't going and leave it at that.""Managers find their options constrained. An attempt to respect the privacy of employees of childbearing age by assigning a trip to an older colleague, or to one who's announced intentions not to have kids, could run afoul of anti-discrimination rules, said Patricia Anderson Pryor, an attorney in employment law and disability for the law firm Jackson Lewis. ""That would create more of a risk liability-wise,"" she said. ""The government has said you cannot restrict an employee's opportunities.""The best course of action for companies, according to experts, is to seek volunteers for travel to areas hit by Zika, and to abide by the evolving guidance laid out by the CDC.Employees who don't want to travel shouldn't have to explain their decision, said Gabby Molinolo, a health and infectious disease specialist for risk management firm iJet International. While pregnant people or those in their childbearing years have the most to fear from Zika, they aren't the only ones with reason to be wary of the virus; older adults may have weaker immune systems and thus may be more vulnerable to either the infection or complications like Guillain-Barre syndrome, Molinolo explained.""Giving an option without disciplinary consequence, an option for an out for all men and women without having to explain the reason why ... is probably one of the best, more passive and more open approaches,"" said Molinolo.Of course, in some professions, travel may be an essential part of the job, adding yet another factor for consideration in the workplace. Several international airlines have allowed flight staff who are or may become pregnant to request reassignment from routes to areas with Zika transmissions, Reuters reported.Female members of the U.S. military who are pregnant can request to leave their outpost, delay deployment or return early from deployment, but approval of any of these requests is at the discretion of the servicewoman's commander.""This guidance applies only to pregnant individuals,"" said Maj Roger Cabiness II, a Department of Defense spokesman. ""Other women, including those of childbearing age considering pregnancy, are advised to contact their health care provider as well, and to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.""At last count, 15 active duty service members have confirmed Zika virus infections, and two pregnant service members had been relocated away from areas with active Zika transmissions.It's unclear exactly what responsibilities fall onto a company if an employee becomes infected during a business trip. Some lawyers said it would be plainly covered by the wide parameters of workers' compensation programs that entitle employees to medical treatment, a portion of lost wages and other benefits. That program often covers workers hurt on the job, say from a fall or a burn, but It also covers sickness.Jody Armour, a University of Southern California law professor, said it's easy to envision a legitimate lawsuit directed at a company by an employee who becomes infected. Asking employees to sign waivers or negotiating additional compensation might reduce the chance of a dispute later, he said. ""You could argue that your employer knew they were sending you into a grossly, excessively risky situation, so they should be treated not just as an accident, but as willful wrongdoing by your employer,"" said Armour.At last count, there had been seven babies born in the United States with microcephaly or other Zika-related birth defects and five lost pregnancies attributed to the virus. All cases were travel-related.Update: This article has been updated to reflect the most recent report on babies born in the U.S. with Zika-related health problems.

"By Toni Clarke(Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday approved a bill to provide financial incentives to companies developing treatments for the Zika virus, sending the measure on to the White House for President Barack Obama's signature.The measure allows the Food and Drug Administration to include Zika drug developers in the agency's priority review voucher program. The program encourages manufacturers to study treatments for diseases that might not be profitable by expediting the regulatory review of a more lucrative drug in their research pipeline.The House of Representatives passed the bill on a voice vote, without a roll call, weeks after the same measure was approved by the Senate.Democrats and administration officials are also urging the Republican-controlled Congress to grant $1.8 billion in emergency funds to combat the spread of Zika. In a temporary fix, the White House said last week that it would redirect $589 million in allocated funds to prepare for the mosquito that carries the disease to emerge in the continental United States.According to the World Health Organization, there is a strong scientific consensus that the Zika virus can cause the rare birth defect microcephaly in newborns. But the link between the virus and the birth defects has not been scientifically established.On Tuesday, Brazil confirmed 1,113 cases of microcephaly and considers most to be related to Zika infections in the mother.Drugmakers who are working on Zika-related drugs, or considering such research, include Sanofi SA, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.Zika was first detected in Brazil last year and is spreading through the Americas. The World Health Organization had declared a global health emergency due to the virus's possible link to microcephaly in babies and Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, in adults.On Monday, top health officials said the mosquito that spreads the virus is now present in about 30 U.S. states, making local outbreaks a possibility. They have also predicted hundreds of thousands of people would be infected in Puerto Rico when the mosquito season kicks in this summer. It could also emerge on the U.S. mainland.A pharmaceutical company may be given a priority review voucher to develop a drug for an infectious disease, in this case Zika, which may not generate much profit for the manufacturer. The voucher gives the company the right to an accelerated review by the FDA of any other, more lucrative, drug in its pipeline.Developing a new drug can take years and cost millions of dollars. A standard FDA review takes at least 10 months to complete - longer if the agency requires additional information. Being able to shave time off that process and get a profitable drug onto the market faster can be worth millions of dollars to a manufacturer.Under the agency's priority review program, companies who submit a drug for review that is intended to treat serious conditions or whose drug shows a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing treatments is eligible to be reviewed in six months, at least four months faster than usual.A priority review voucher gives a company the right to a six-month review on any product, regardless of whether it meets the conditions normally required to receive an accelerated review. It also gives the company the right to sell the voucher to another company.The law currently makes any company eligible for a priority review voucher that is developing a drug for one of more than 20 tropical diseases listed under the voucher program. These include malaria, cholera, leprosy, dengue, tuberculosis, and ebola. The FDA has the authority to add other infectious diseases to the list which primarily affects poor countries.(Reporting by Toni Clarke and David Morgan in Washington; Editing by Bernard Orr)","huffingtonpost","left","16903","zika",644
"Class of 2016, Tell Us Who We Are Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comGraduates of 2016, don't be fooled by this glorious day.  As you leave campus for the last time, many of you already deeply in debt and with a lifetime of payments to look forward to, you head into a world that's anything but sunny.  In fact, through those gates that have done little enough to protect you is the sort of fog bank that results in traffic pile-ups on any highway.And if you imagine that I'm here to sweep that fog away and tell you what truly lies behind it, think again.  My only consolation is that, if I can't adequately explain our American world to you or your path through it, I doubt any other speaker could either.Of course, it's not exactly a fog-lifter to say that, like it or not, you're about to graduate onto Planet Donald -- and I don't mean, for all but a few of you, a future round of golf at Mar-a-Lago.  Our increasingly unnerved and disturbed world is his circus right now (whether he wins the coming election or not), just as in the Philippines, it's the circus of new president Rodrigo Duterte; in Hungary, of right-wing populist Viktor Orbán; in Austria, of Norbert Hofer, the extremist anti-immigrant presidential candidate who just lost a squeaker by .6% of the vote; in Israel, of new defense minister Avigdor Lieberman; in Russia, of the autocratic Vladimir Putin; in France, of Marine le Pen, leader of the right-wing National Front party, who has sometimes led in polls for the next presidential election; and so on.  And if you don't think that's a less than pretty political picture of our changing planet, then don't wait for the rest of this speech, just hustle out those gates.  You've got a treat ahead of you.For the rest of us lingerers, it says something about where we all are that, once through those gates, you'll still find yourself in the richest, most powerful country around, the planet's ""sole superpower.""  (USA!  USA!)  It is, however, a superpower distinctly in decline on -- and this is a historic first -- a planet similarly in decline.In its halcyon days, Washington could overthrow governments, install Shahs or other rulers, do more or less what it wanted across significant parts of the globe and reap rewards, while (as in the case of Iran) not paying any price, blowback-style, for decades, if at all.  That was imperial power in the blaze of the noonday sun.  These days, in case you hadn't noticed, blowback for our imperial actions seems to arrive as if by high-speed rail (of which by the way, the greatest power on the planet has yet to build a single mile, if you want a quick measure of decline).Despite having a more massive, technologically advanced, and better funded military than any other power or even group of powers on the planet, in the last decade and a half of constant war across the Greater Middle East and parts of Africa, the U.S. has won nothing, nada, zilch.  Its unending wars have, in fact, led nowhere in a world growing more chaotic by the second.  Its militarized ""milestones,"" like the recent drone-killing in Pakistan of the leader of the Taliban, have proven repetitive signposts on what, even in the present fog, is surely the road to hell.It's been relatively easy, if you live here, to notice little enough of all this and -- at least until Donald Trump arrived to the stunned fascination of the country (not to speak of the rest of the planet) -- to imagine that we live in a peaceable land with most of its familiar markers still reassuringly in place.  We still have elections, our tripartite form of government (as well as the other accoutrements of a democracy), our reverential view of our Constitution and the rights it endows us with, and so on.  In truth, however, the American world is coming to bear ever less resemblance to the one we still claim as ours, or rather that older America looks increasingly like a hollowed-out shell within which something new and quite different has been gestating.After all, can anyone really doubt that representative democracy as it once existed has been eviscerated and is now -- consider Congress exhibit A -- in a state of advanced paralysis, or that just about every aspect of the country's infrastructure, is slowly fraying or crumbling and that little is being done about it?  Can anyone doubt that the constitutional system -- take war powers as a prime example or, for that matter, American liberties -- has also been fraying?  Can anyone doubt that the country's classic tripartite form of government, from a Supreme Court missing a member by choice of Congress to a national security state that mocks the law, is ever less checked and balanced and increasingly more than ""tri""?In the Vietnam era, people first began talking about an ""imperial presidency.""  Today, in areas of overwhelming importance, the White House is, if anything, somewhat less imperial, but only because it's more in thrall to the ever-expanding national security state.  Though that unofficial fourth branch of government is seldom seriously considered when the ways in which our American world works are being described and though it has no place in the Constitution, it is increasingly the first branch of government in Washington, the one before which all the others kneel down.There has, in this endless election season, been much discussion of Donald Trump's potential for ""authoritarianism"" (or incipient ""fascism,"" or worse).  It's a subject generally treated as if it were some tendency or property unique to the man who rode a Trump Tower escalator into the presidential race to Neil Young's ""Rockin' in the Free World,"" or perhaps something from the 1930s that he carries in his jacket pocket and that his enthusiastic white working class followers are naturally drawn to and responsible for.Few bother to consider the ways in which the foundations of authoritarianism have already been laid in this society -- and not by disaffected working class white men either.  Few bother to consider what it means to have a national security state and a massive military machine deeply embedded in our ruling city and our American world.  Few think about the (count 'em!) 17 significant intelligence agencies that eat close to $70 billion annually or the trillion dollars or more a year that disappears into our national security world, or what it means for that state within a state, that shadow government, to become ever more powerful and autonomous in the name of American ""safety,"" especially from ""terrorism"" (though terrorism represents the most microscopic of dangers for most Americans).In this long election season, amid all the charges leveled at Donald Trump, where have you seen serious discussion of what it means for the Pentagon's spy drones to be flying missions over the ""homeland"" or for ""intelligence"" agencies to be wielding the kind of blanket surveillance of everyone's communications -- from foreign leaders to peasants in Afghanistan to American citizens -- that, technologically speaking, put the totalitarian regimes of the previous century to shame?  Is there nothing of the authoritarian lurking in all this?  Could that urge really be the property of The Donald and his followers alone?Perhaps it would be better to see Donald Trump as a symptom, not the problem itself, to think of him not as the Zika Virus but as the first infectious mosquito to hit the shores of this country. If you need proof that he's at worst a potential aider and abettor of authoritarianism, just take a look at the rest of our world, where the mosquitoes are many and the virus of right-wing authoritarianism spreading rapidly with the rise of a new nationalism (that often goes hand in hand with anti-immigrant fervor of a Trumpian sort).  He is, in other words, just one particularly bizarre figure in an increasingly crowded room.Bursting Bubbles and Melting Ice CapsIf, as the first openly declinist presidential candidate, it's The Donald's job to make America great again, and if, despite its obvious wealth and military strength, the heartlands of the U.S. do look ever more Third World-ish, then consider the rest of the planet.  Is there any place that doesn't look at least a little, and in a remarkable number of cases, a lot the worse for wear?  Leave aside those parts of the world from Afghanistan to Syria, Yemen to Libya, Nigeria to Venezuela that increasingly have the look of incipient or completely failed states.  Consider instead that former Cold War enemy, that ""Evil Empire"" of a previous incarnation, the once-upon-a-time Soviet Union, now Vladimir Putin's Russia.It has made it to the top of the American military's list of enemies.  And yet, despite its rebuilt military and still massive nuclear arsenal, the superpower of yesterday is now a rickety petro-state with a restive population, a country that is neither great, nor rising, and may in fact be in genuine trouble.  Yes, it has been aggressive in its borderlands (though largely in response to a sense of, or fear of, being aggressed upon) and yes, it is an authoritarian land, but no longer is it the planet's second superpower or anything remotely like it.  Its future looks, at best, insecure, at worst bleak indeed.Even China, the only obvious rising power on the planet (now that countries like Brazil and South Africa are falling by the wayside), that genuine economic powerhouse of the last decade, has seen its economy slow significantly.  In such a moment, who knows what one burst bubble, real estate or otherwise, might do there?  An economic meltdown in the People's Republic, with an expanding middle class that still remains small compared to its peasant masses, and an unparalleled record of peasant revolts extending back centuries, could prove an ominous event.And mind you, graduates of 2016, that's just to begin a discussion of the stresses on a planet whose ice caps are melting, sea levels rising, waters warming, forests drying, fire seasons expanding, storms intensifying, and temperatures rising (while petro-states, frackers, and giant oil companies keep pumping fossil fuels in ever more inventive ways as if there were -- and don't just think of it as a figure of speech -- no tomorrow).  In such a situation, no place, including this country, is too big to fail.  And on such a helter-skelter planet, who will be there to bail out the too-big-to-fail states or anyone else?  Judging by none-too-big-to-fail countries like Libya, Yemen, and Syria that have already essentially collapsed, the answer might be no one.Decades ago, in the mid-1970s, in the first book I ever wrote, I labeled our American world ""beyond our control.""  Little did I know!Now, let's turn to you, graduates of 2016, and while we're at it, to what we're still calling an ""election.""  I'm talking about the roiling, ever-expanding phenomenon that now fills our TV screens and the ""news"" more or less 24/7 and for which, whatever he's done and whomever he's insulted, Donald Trump cannot all by himself be held to blame.There is, to my mind, one question that makes what we call ""election 2016"" of paramount interest, even if we seldom bother to think about it: What the hell is it?  We still refer to it as an ""election,"" of course, and on November 4th millions of us will indeed enter voting booths and opt for a candidate.  Still, don't tell me that, in any normal sense, this is an election, this weird money machine pouring billions and billions of dollars into the coffers of media barons, this endless, overblown, onrushing event with its ""debates"" and insults and anger and minute-by-minute polling results and squadrons of talking heads yammering away about nothing in particular, this bizarre stage set for an utterly unfiltered narcissist and reality-show host and casino owner and bankruptee and braggart and liar and fantasist and womanizer and... well, you know the list better than I do.  Yes, it will put someone in the Oval Office next January and fill Congress with the usual set of clashing deadheads, but in any past sense of the word, an election?  I don't think so.Don't tell me it isn't something new and different.  Everyone knows it is.  But what, exactly?  I have no idea.  It's clear enough, however, that our American system is morphing in ways for which we have no names, no adequate descriptive vocabulary.  Perhaps it's not just that we have no clear bead on what's going on, but that we prefer not to know.Whether Donald Trump wins or not, rest assured that we all have an education ahead of us.  This, after all, is our world now.  You have no choice but to leave these grounds and neither, in a sense, do your parents, grandparents, siblings, friends, the whole lot of us.  Whether we like it or not, we're all being shoved unceremoniously into an American world that's changing in unnerving ways on a planet itself in transformation.Which brings me to the task ahead of your generation (not mine), as I imagine it.  After all, I'm almost 72 years old.  I'm superannuated.  When something goes wrong on my computer I genuinely believe myself doomed, grieve for the lost days of the typewriter, and then, in despair, call my daughter.  And if I can't even grasp the basics of the machine I now live on much of the time, how likely is it that I -- and my ilk -- can grasp the world in which it's implanted?As I see it, you've been attending classes, studying, and preparing all these years for just this moment.  Now, it's your job to step into the fog-bound landscape beyond these gates where the pile-ups are already happening and make sense of it for the rest of us.  Soon, graduates of 2016, you will leave this campus.  The question is: What can you do for yourself and the rest of us then?Here's my thought: to change this world of ours, you first have to name (or rename) it, as any magical realist novelist from Gabriel Garcia Márquez on has long known.  The world is only yours when you've given it and its component parts names.If there's one thing that the Occupy Wall Street movement reminded us of, it was this: that the first task in changing our world is to find new words to describe it.  In 2011, that movement arrived at Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan calling the masters of our universe ""the 1%"" and the rest of us ""the 99%.""  Simply wielding those two phrases brought to the fore a set of previously half-seen realities -- the growing inequality gap in this country and the world -- and so briefly electrified the country and changed the conversation.  By relabeling the mental map of our world, those protesters cleared some of the fog away, allowing us to begin to imagine paths through it and so ways to act.Right now, we need you to take these last four hard years and everything you know, including what you weren't taught in any classroom but learned on your own -- your experience, for instance, of your education as a financial rip-off -- and tell those of us in desperate need of fresh eyes just how our world should be described.In order to act, in order to change much of anything, you first need to give that world the names, the labels, it deserves, and they may not be ""election"" or ""democracy"" or so many of the other commonplace words of our past and our present moment.  Otherwise, we'll all continue to spend our time struggling to grasp ghostly shapes in that fog.Now, all you graduates, form up your serried ranks, muster the words you've taken four years to master, and prepare to march out of those gates and begin to apply them in ways that your elders are incapable of doing.Class of 2016, tell us who we are and where we are.Tom Engelhardt is a co-founder of the American Empire Project and the author

"Bangladesh authorities have confirmed they found the Zika virus in a blood sample from an elderly man who did not leave the country.""The virus was found in the man as we tested old blood samples of nearly 1,000 people afflicted with fever in 2014 and 2015,"" explained Mahmudur Rahman, director of the Health Ministry's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research.The 67-year-old never traveled overseas. Authorities also said none of his relatives tested positive for the virus.A source told bdnews24.com that the government sent a health team to Chittagong to ""a specific area."" The team will ""collect information, a practice known as 'contact tracing' after any new outbreak."" Prof. AKM Shamsuzzaman, line director of the government's Communicable Disease Control, told the outlet the group has ""strengthened out regular searching activities in Chittagong."" He did not comment on Zika, however.The government decided to test old blood samples after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika a public health emergency on February 1. Thousands of cases of the virus linked to birth defects in newborn children forced the organization to take the step.""I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities reported in Latin America following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014 constitutes a public health emergency of international concern,"" announced WHO Director General Margaret Chan.Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which occurs when the brain does not fully form during pregnancy or after birth. This leads to serious mental disabilities.Doctors found the disease in an infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" stated CDC director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of asserting Zika caused the microcephaly cases. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.WHO also said sexual transmission of Zika is more common than they thought. Chan said the organization reached these conclusions due to ""reports and investigations in several countries."" She described the findings as ""alarming.""South Korea confirmed its first Zika case a few days ago after a 43-year-old man returned from Brazil. Doctors diagnosed him with the virus after he suffered from ""fever, muscle pain and rash."" Authorities have quarantined him until he fully recovers.","breitbart","right","16883","zika",413
"Pharmaceutical giant Bayer has given Puerto Rico a ""very substantial donation"" to help it fight the Zika virus, including thousands of mosquito nets and units of birth control for women who want to avoid pregnancy during the outbreak, the philanthropic arm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.Zika virus causes serious birth defects, so the CDC has advised pregnant women to avoid travel to areas where it is circulating on its own.The agency on Thursday said that 168 pregnant women on the U.S. mainland and 142 in the U.S. territories, mainly in Puerto Rico, have showed evidence of Zika infection as of May 19.At the same time, Puerto Rico is reeling from a fiscal crisis that threatens hospital services and health care programs.Bayer's donation to the island includes 10,000 mosquito nets, 700,000 mosquito-control tablets that can be used to treat the nets, 50,000 intrauterine devices and 40,000 units of oral contraceptives, according to the CDC Foundation.""We must act quickly and on a large scale to address the threat of Zika in Puerto Rico,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden said. ""Bayer's generous donation of bed nets, insecticide tablets and contraception can help women protect themselves from the devastating impact of this virus.""Zika virus is causing infants to be born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly, in Brazil and other Latin American countries. It is the first time that scientists have directly linked insect bites to serious birth defects.""It is unprecedented, it is tragic and it is now proven,"" Dr. Frieden said Thursday in a speech at the National Press Club.Many of the affected countries have strict rules on abortion or contraception, kicking off a debate over how to deal with pregnancies that run into complications because of Zika.In the meantime, the CDC Foundation said it is still seeking $20 million to broaden access to contraceptives in Puerto Rico.Its turn to private donors comes as Congress tries to reconcile competing House and Senate measures to fund efforts to develop a better diagnostic test and a vaccine for Zika, while boosting local mosquito-control efforts.The Senate struck a bipartisan deal that offers $1.1 billion emergency spending that isn't offset with budget cuts elsewhere, while the House passed a bill that would take $622 million from the Ebola fight in West Africa and other health programs to deal with the mosquito-borne illness.Both measures are far short of the $1.9 billion in emergency spending that President Obama requested, outraging the White House and Democratic allies who say GOP leaders are shortchanging the effort.Republican leaders say the administration has already directed nearly $600 million to the fight and from other sources, and that appropriators are working to free up even more money as part of the fiscal 2017 spending process. ","washingtontimes","right","16947","zika",464
"The House brushed aside President Obama's veto threat and passed a bill Wednesday that takes hundreds of millions from the Ebola fight and other federal accounts to fight the Zika virus, laying down a marker that's only a third of what the White House wanted to combat the mosquito-borne illness.Approved 241-184, the legislation provides nearly $500 million less than a Zika proposal moving through the Senate and is far below the $1.9 billion package that Mr. Obama requested in February.Unlike those proposals, the House fully paid for its $622 million plan by using existing federal funds instead of tacking the expense onto the deficit, setting up a clash over how to proceed.Rep. Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican and Appropriations Committee chairman, said the administration failed to justify its full request, so he determined what was necessary to fight the Zika virus over the next five months.He said additional funding could be freed up during the annual spending process for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.""Every child deserves the chance at a full and healthy life, and every mother deserves to see her child survive,"" Mr. Rogers said. ""This measure will help make this happen for sure, in an effective, efficient and responsible way.""                                                                    SEE ALSO: Marco Rubio pleads with GOP to fund full Zika request, backfill money later                                            Democrats and at least one House Republican on Wednesday said the GOP plan shortchanges states on the front lines of a potential outbreak. They said the government should borrow nearly $2 billion to meet the administration's demands, saying there is neither the time nor enough waste to find the money elsewhere in the country's $4 trillion budget.""The lives of thousands of infants are potentially at risk. There's no excuse for failure to act responsibly and swiftly,"" said Rep. Vern Buchanan, Florida Republican, who wants to fully fund Mr. Obama's request.Mr. Obama insists that scientists need the full amount to develop and better diagnostic test and vaccine for Zika, which causes birth defects, while bolstering efforts to kill the mosquitoes that ferry the virus.He said he will reject the House's bill because it ignores his funding level and taps more Ebola money, instead of backfilling the $510 million he already took from that fight to prepare for the latest health scare.""The only thing that Republicans in the House have come forward with is funding at like a third of the level that our public health experts recommend, but taking every single penny of that money away from efforts to protect the American people from Ebola,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. ""That is a dumb approach.""A bid to attach Mr. Obama's full request to a Senate funding bill failed to advance Tuesday. Instead, senators voted 68-29 to head off a potential filibuster of a $1.1. billion deal brokered by both parties.Zika is a little-known virus that festered for decades in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region before globe-hopping to Latin America, where it is causing serious birth defects.The Centers for Disease Control has recorded 500 travel-related cases of Zika in the states and D.C., a handful of them through sexual transmission, and scientists say the virus could puncture the mainland further once temperatures climb and disease-carrying mosquitoes flourish.The House voted hours after the World Health Organization told Europe to gird for the Zika virus, underscoring the potential reach of the disease.Portugal's Madeira islands and stretches of Russia and Georgia on the Black Sea are home to the primary mosquito that carries Zika, and therefore face the highest risk, according to the global health arm of the U.N. Eighteen countries are at ""moderate"" risk because they host a second, though less threatening, breed of mosquito that can ferry the virus. France, Italy and Malta face the most danger in this group.The rest of the WHO's European member states - 36 countries - have a low risk of transmission, because their climates aren't hospitable to the disease-carrying insects.""We call particularly on countries at higher risk to strengthen their national capacities and prioritize the activities that will prevent a large Zika outbreak,"" said Dr. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO's regional director for Europe. ","washingtontimes","right","16939","zika",700

Other than affecting women who are pregnant, he said the virus is a ""generally not very serious virus.""","breitbart","right","16838","zika",117
"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's top health official said on Monday that the Zika virus outbreak is proving to be worse than believed because most cases show no symptoms, but improved testing should allow the country to get a better grip on the burgeoning public health crisis.Health Minister Marcelo Castro told Reuters that Brazil will start mandatory reporting of cases by local governments next week when most states will have labs equipped to test for Zika, the mosquito-borne virus that has quickly spread through Latin America. The virus has no vaccine or cure at present.On Monday, the World Health Organization declared the Zika outbreak to be a global emergency, a decision that should help fast-track international action and research priorities.In Brazil, believed to be the country hit hardest by Zika, the outbreak has sparked fear especially among pregnant women after local experts linked the virus to thousands of cases of microcephaly, or abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains, in newborns.""Eighty percent of the people infected by Zika do not develop significant symptoms. A large number of people have the virus with no symptoms, so the situation is more serious that we can imagine,"" Castro said in an interview.""Our big hope is finding a vaccine,"" he added.The Zika emergency comes at a particularly bad time for President Dilma Rousseff's unpopular government, adding a new burden to a public health system hit by budget cuts in the midst of a severe recession. It has also cast a shadow on Brazil's hosting of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August.The Rousseff government said there was no chance the Games will be called due to the health scare.""We have to explain to those coming to Brazil, the athletes, that there is zero risk if you are not a pregnant woman,"" Rousseff's chief of staff Jaques Wagner told reporters.The Brazilian government suspects the virus was brought to Brazil during the 2014 soccer World Cup by a visitor from Africa or Oceania where Zika is endemic. An estimated 1.5 million Brazilians have caught Zika, a virus first detected in Africa in the 1947 and unknown in the Americas until it appeared in May in the poverty-stricken northeastern region of Brazil.Read the full story at Reuters.","breitbart","right","16832","zika",382
"Zika manufacturing facility.The communication stream between the White House and Congress these days is more like a trickle, and most of that is simply Congress passing on their 4,323rd symbolic We Don't Like You to the president. However, there are still a few things being done on Capitol Hill. They're just being done really, really poorly.The Obama administration requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding to respond to the looming public-health threat. The White House noted at the time, ""This sort of falls in the category of things that shouldn't break down along party lines.""Sky blue, said the Obama White House. Water wet. Big epidemics featuring dangerous rapidly spreading diseases that cause devastating birth defects, bad. So you know what's coming next.But that's exactly what happened anyway. Congressional Republicans responded to the request by telling the administration to use $600 million that had been allocated to combat Ebola. The trouble, of course, is that this money (a) is far short of the $1.9 billion needed, and (b) still being used to address Ebola in West Africa.At that point, the CDC stepped in to declare that the situation was really serious, and that Congress needed to allocate the funds. Followed by multiple other health organizations stepping in to say that the situation was extremely dangerous, and that Congress should allocate the funds. Followed by the OMB reminding Congress that the ebola funds were kinda sorta being used to fight ebola, and they should really allocate the funds.","dailykos","left","16905","zika",248
"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Department of Defense (DOD) experts will support the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in its fight against the mosquito-borne Zika virus in the Americas, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook told reporters.On the heels of Cook's comments, General Dr. Margaret Chan, director of the World Health Organization (WHO), warned that the virus, which has been linked to a wave of birth defects in Latin America, ""is now spreading explosively"" in ""23 countries and territories"" across the Americas, noting that ""the level of alarm is extremely high"" during a press briefing Thursday.On Wednesday, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook told reporters that the Pentagon has been asked to assist HHS in assembling experts and stakeholders, particularly in the area of research.""My understanding is we've been asked - and, again, the deputy secretary was at the White House yesterday - we've been asked to support Health and Human Services in their efforts to convene experts and stakeholders, specifically in the research area,"" the DOD press secretary told reporters Wednesday.""This is an area where the DOD has done some research in the past, and I think some of that expertise will be brought to this effort, and we'll be supporting HHS in whatever way we can,"" added Cook.Asked whether the Pentagon's participation in the fight would resemble the U.S. military's role in containing the Ebola virus in Africa, the press secretary responded, ""I don't think anyone is talking about that kind of role at this particular time. So this is a support role, again, sharing our research knowledge as much as anything else, with the folks at HHS.""President Obama, along with public health and national security officials, convened in the White House Situation Room Tuesday to discuss battle plans to protect Americans and prevent the spread of the disease in the U.S.Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work, the No. 2 at the Pentagon, as well as leaders from HHS, CDC, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) participated in the White House meeting.Due to its alarming link to a neurological disorder known as microcephaly, which makes it especially dangerous for pregnant women and their babies, the Zika virus has raised concerns in the Americas.In Brazil, where the first confirmed infection was detected, the disease has been linked to a skyrocketing number of cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect in which babies are born with smaller heads than normal and often have developmental problems.There is no vaccine or preventing drug to combat the virus, notes U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Although the disease has not reached the continental United States, save through travelers to affected areas, it has been detected in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, CDC points out.Nevertheless, the CDC warns:In May 2015, the first local transmission of Zika was identified in Brazil.""Local transmission means that mosquitoes in Mexico have been infected with Zika virus, spreading it to people,"" explains CDC.By the middle of this month, local transmission had spread to at least 14 countries or territories in the Americas, including to United States southern neighbor Mexico.""Further spread to other countries in the region is likely,"" adds CDC. ""Local transmission of Zika virus has not been documented in the continental United States. However, Zika virus infections have been reported in travelers returning to the United States.""Both legal and illegal travelers to the U.S. from countries where mosquitos carry the virus could potentially bring the disease to this country.CDC has issued a travel alert for people traveling to territories and countries where the Zika virus is active: Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela and Puerto Rico.""Zika virus is spread to people through mosquito bites. The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes),"" explains CDC.

"Co-written by Douglas Morgan, director of Latin America sites in the Vanderbilt University Institute for Global Health""Where you live shouldn't determine whether you live,"" is a quotation often heard in global health circles, often espoused by the Irish rock star, Bono and his ONE Campaign. But the mantra is especially poignant in countries such as El Salvador. The Central America Four (CA-4) region (El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua), with a population of 37 million, and additional 5 million immigrants in the U.S., is one of the principal low/middle income regions in the western hemisphere. El Salvador is representative, as one of the most difficult countries to live in worldwide, suffering from the violence of poverty, gang warfare, and the recent civil wars. In fact, for adolescents, reminiscent of the civil war years, there are stark choices: join a gang, face daily intimidation and violence, or emigrate.Over 30 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty, living on less than $1.25 per day. These conditions have serious consequences including a lack of access to sufficient nutrition, water, and sanitation services. Alongside the endemic poverty, the homicide rate is among the highest in the world, with astronomical murder rates, over 18 per day.  Although most of this is ""gang on gang"" violence, the entire population is trapped in the daily crossfire. Nelson Mandela commented, ""Freedom would be meaningless without security in the home and in the streets."" To add to these challenges, El Salvador is now grappling with the epidemic of the Zika virus. To date, the Zika virus has been associated with over 4,000 cases of microcephaly in Brazil and Latin America. Over 4 million people are expected to contract the virus within the next year.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others have issued advisories for the Americas calling for postponing travel to the region, mosquito bite avoidance, and safe sex practices. In El Salvador and other countries, the Ministries of Health have advised women to consider delaying pregnancy for the next two years, in anticipation of mosquito control programs and potential population immunity. In El Salvador, how can women take an active role in safe sex practices and delaying a pregnancy over the next two years? Currently, over half the pregnancies in El Salvador are unintended. Because of the high rates of sexual violence, in February, El Salvador created a specialized court system for violence against women. Moreover, there is limited access to contraceptives due to ""gatekeepers"" limiting access to contraceptives to women, and documented ""stock outs"" where modern methods of contraceptives are simply unavailable.         For young girls who bear the brunt of much of this poverty and violence, the need for education and assistance with access to contraceptives is critical, timely, and compassionate. One out of every 12 girls in El Salvador is a mother by the time she is 15, and in the rural areas, the number is one in five. By age 18, over 30 percent of girls have had at least one pregnancy, which accounts for nearly a third of the pregnancies in the country, one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in Latin America.         In recent years, suicide rates have skyrocketed for young, pregnant women in El Salvador. Over 57 percent of the deaths of pregnant females aged 10 to 19 in El Salvador are attributed to suicide and likely subject to under-reporting.One response would be to facilitate access to counseling and contraception to prevent an unwanted, unintended pregnancy in the face of violence, shame, and now, the effects of the Zika virus epidemic. Women in El Salvador currently have great difficulty accessing contraceptives, including birth control pills and condoms. Although legal in El Salvador, birth control can only be given to women with a prescription and the pills themselves are only sold in some pharmacies. There is a limited availability of condoms, which are expensive. Recent evidence suggests that Zika can be transmitted through sex, such that condoms may be the most important contraceptive for consideration.        Having access to contraception for all girls, women, and partners in El Salvador would be life-saving and compassionate.  Women who postpone the debut of her first pregnancy until she is 20 years of age are exponentially more likely to survive the complications and birth, as is the newborn child. And if she can time her children just three years apart, her child is twice as likely to survive, especially in settings of extreme poverty.         For women in El Salvador, the prescription for abstinence either before or during marriage is an impractical one, perhaps a naïve wish.  The possibility for education on natural family planning, or fertility awareness is a viable component, but the access to modern contraceptives, as supported by Pope Francis as a means to prevent the devastation of the Zika virus, would be a compassionate step forward to uplift this extremely vulnerable population of young women. Currently, our U.S. government does not fund international, voluntary family planning efforts in El Salvador. We can urge our members of Congress to reconsider funding in El Salvador, exclusive of abortion prohibited by the Helms Amendment, to save the lives of women and children across the nation. We ask you to join us in this effort.   For many, the El Salvadoran martyr, Monseñor Oscar Romero embodied the visions of Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King in the Latin America context during the civil wars in El Salvador. He commented, ""There are not two categories of people. There are not some who were born to have everything and leave others with nothing ... God wants a Christian society, one in which we share the good things that God has given for all of us."" (The opinions expressed herein are the authors' and not of their respective institutions).

"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Georgetown University's Daniel Lucey and Lawrence Gostin about the global response to the Zika virus.The World Health Organization was widely criticized for delays and mismanagement in its response to the Ebola crisis that ravaged three West African countries in 2014. The Ebola virus has killed over 11,000 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, since 2013. Liberia and Guinea have recently been declared Ebola-free, although experts warn the virus can quickly re-emerge.Now, a new public health crisis is emerging in the Americas. The Zika virus, first discovered in Uganda's Zika forest over 60 years ago, spread in recent years to the South Pacific and the Americas. The virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and, like Ebola, has no vaccine or cure, was initially not thought to be very dangerous, mostly causing a mild rash or fever. But a large outbreak of the virus in Brazil last year was linked to an explosion in reported cases of microcephaly, a condition that causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads. The possible connection between the Zika virus and microcephaly, which has yet to be confirmed, led Brazil to declare a national emergency in November.The virus has spread rapidly, with reported cases in 23 countries and territories in the Americas. Earlier this month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alert advising pregnant women to consider postponing travel to countries with the Zika virus. On Thursday, the WHO announced it will convene a special emergency committee on the Zika virus on Monday, the first step towards possibly declaring a public health emergency.  A few days earlier, Georgetown University's Daniel Lucey and Lawrence Gostin had published a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association urging the WHO not to delay its response to the Zika virus any further. The WorldPost spoke to Lucey, a senior scholar at the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown, and Gostin, the institute's director, about the lessons of the Ebola crisis.What lessons do you hope the WHO has taken from the Ebola crisis that can be applied to the emerging Zika pandemic? Lucey: The WHO director general Margaret Chan delayed very, very long the convening of the special emergency committee with regard to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. I was working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone and Liberia during the outbreak in 2014, and it really made a searing impression on me as to the real world, on-the-ground and in this case catastrophic consequences of decisions that are made -- or not made -- in places like the WHO headquarters in Geneva. That was a large part of what motivated me to write the article with my colleague, Professor Gostin, urging the WHO director general to convene a special emergency committee. She delayed doing it again with Zika, although hopefully not with such catastrophic consequences as with Ebola.It was already evident several weeks ago that the Zika pandemic is worth paying attention to.  The question will arise as to how much earlier should the committee have been convened, particularly if there are waves of epidemics of microcephaly in other countries affected by Zika. I hope and pray that there won't be. But if there are epidemics of microcephaly in other Latin American countries, it's a tragedy, and there'll be more lessons to learn from that. When she said on Thursday she was going to convene the committee, honestly, I was overjoyed. The committee has very specific responsibilities -- it really galvanizes the international community under the leadership of the WHO headquarters, so the entire world can benefit from harmonized communications and guidance about the outbreak. But it's only the beginning. It's like the key that you have to turn to unlock the door, and now you have to go through the door.Gostin: The critical lesson is not to wait until a crisis spins out of control. Act rapidly, decisively and with leadership. When the Emergency Committee on Zika meets, actions will speak louder than words. These actions are vast mobilization of funding and international support to drastically reduce the mosquito population in Zika-affected areas, intense surveillance, determining conclusively the link between Zika and infant malformations and accelerated research for a vaccine.Are there other ways the WHO and the international community have applied some of the lessons of the Ebola crisis so far?Lucey: I think so. For example, Brazil responded in a very timely manner to the growing epidemic of microcephaly, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has done an excellent job at issuing epidemiological alerts. I think the U.S. CDC issuing a level 2 travel alert was appropriate, balanced advice and a proactive step.It's about the speed of response, the resources put in, and making sure the resources are appropriate. You have to frequently reassess the situation. That's very important lesson that should be learned from Ebola. After a sharp increase in patients in Liberia it was predictable [that it would spread further], but there just weren't enough diagnostic laboratories or healthcare workers.Zika is very different from Ebola. What new challenges does the Zika virus present to the international community?Gostin: Zika's challenges come from the mosquito vector. This mosquito is ubiquitous, found in every region of the world. If we are not proactive and attack the problem with overwhelming resolve, the hazard of Zika will spread worldwide. If we see a wave of fetal abnormalities nine months after Zika outbreaks, it will be an enormous ethical and public health failure.Lucey: Brazil has a wonderful medical research tradition and healthcare providers. To my knowledge, there's no shortage of hands-on patient care that there certainly was in West Africa. There is an urgent research issue and it is being addressed. One challenge is the amount of travel to places where Zika is transmitted. There's so many more travelers to the 21 or so countries or territories in the Americas with reports of the Zika virus than there was to the three very underdeveloped, impoverished countries impacted by Ebola.What lessons should the public health community apply from the development of Ebola vaccines and treatment during the crisis in West Africa to the current response to the Zika virus?Gostin:  What we have learned is you need two things to speed vaccine research. First, there is the need for enormous funding. Second is the need for public private partnerships to harness the best talent in government and industry.Lucey: Even though there's still no licensed Ebola vaccine, one of the good things the WHO did early during the Ebola crisis was to bring together experts who decided that it would be ethical to do investigational studies for treatments and vaccines in the middle of an outbreak, as long as it's done in a transparent, ethical manner with the approval of institutional review boards and ethical oversight from within each of the countries.It was really a phenomenal thing that so many partners came together to do a study in Guinea. The results of this research are still going through an approval process, but it's a remarkable success story. I think if Brazil and other countries affected by Zika epidemic choose to work with international partners, then they can look back to the recent successful precedent with Ebola vaccines in West Africa.The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Interviews were conducted separately with Daniel Lucey by phone, and with Lawrence O. Gostin via email on Friday.","huffingtonpost","left","16830","zika",1352
"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made one crucial update Friday to its travel warnings for the 37 countries and territories affected by Zika virus. Instead of issuing a blanket warning against entire countries, the CDC is adjusting their health notices to take into account the area's elevation. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, the main mode of Zika virus transmission, does not generally live in areas that are 6,500 feet or more above sea level.This means women who are pregnant will likely not encounter a mosquito carrying Zika if they stay in high-elevation areas, although the agency notes that the virus can still be transmitted sexually at higher altitudes. Pregnant women are most at risk with Zika virus because it's suspected of causing severe birth defects like microcephaly. The CDC previously advised pregnant women to postpone all unnecessary travel to areas affected by the epidemic; now, the CDC recommends they postpone travel to areas below the elevation threshold.  Only 16 countries with ongoing Zika virus transmission have areas with these higher, safer elevations: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela. No U.S. territories are affected by the health notice adjustment.To give you an example of what the revised travel warnings look like, here's a map of Mexico that differentiates between low- and high-risk areas for mosquito transmission of Zika virus. As you can see, Mexico City is among those areas that have a low risk of transmission via mosquitoes. Other capital cities, like La Paz, Bolivia, Bogota, Colombia and Quito, Ecuador are also low-risk mosquito zones. Other capital cities, like La Paz, Bolivia, Bogota, Colombia and Quito, Ecuador are also low-risk mosquito zones. CDC scientists decided to revise the health warnings after acknowledging that mosquitos only thrive in very specific temperatures. But because it's difficult to predict changes in temperature over time, they decided to use elevation as a proxy for temperature. After all, mountain ranges don't fluctuate, and elevation can influence temperature and determine whether or not a habitat is suitable for mosquitos.After analyzing past data on Aedes aegypti and the historic spread of dengue fever, which is carried by the same mosquito, they found that only 1.1 percent of dengue cases had ever occurred at elevations above 6,500 feet. This led them to believe it will be a similar case for Zika.However, the agency also notes that the low oxygen levels at high elevations can pose problems for all travelers, and pregnant ones in particular.  ""Pregnant women should avoid strenuous activities at high elevations, and some doctors recommend that pregnant women not spend the night at altitudes above 3,650 m (12,000 ft),"" the CDC report states. ""Pregnant women should also consider whether they will have access to medical care at a high-elevation destination.""All U.S. travelers should protect themselves against mosquito bites, even if they aren't pregnant. The virus is generally mild but also suspected of triggering Guillain-Barrée Syndrome, a neurological disorder that can temporarily paralyze patients. And men who are in relationships with pregnant women should also make sure to guard against bites and wear condoms to prevent sexual transmission of the virus to their partner.","huffingtonpost","left","16871","zika",558
"As the Zika virus spreads, so has widespread alarm and confusion. The leader of the World Health Organization said Wednesday that it is ""spreading explosively,"" estimating up to 4 million infections over the next year.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that a U.S. outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus, which is spreading rapidly through mostly central and south America, is ""likely,"" but the risk for local transmission is low. In Brazil, the virus has been linked to several thousand cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect which causes shrinkage of the skull and brain. ""The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty,"" WHO director-general Dr. Margaret Chan told the organization's executive board members. ""We need to get some answers quickly.""To explain more, HuffPost Science talked to Dr. Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, whose work focuses on the causes and prevention of infectious diseases in industrialized and developing countries. Why is Zika virus spreading now, when it's been around for decades in Asia and Africa? This is not a new virus. It's been known for 25 or 30 years but has never really spread to this extent.This virus has been documented in Africa. It was documented creating issues in Indonesia. It was one of these things were you get a couple days of fever, a little bit of a rash, maybe some joint pain and then it goes away. It was dismissed. Zika had been viewed as a minor threat until we got into the situation where there were enough new cases to recognize this microcephaly situation, which has not been recognized before. Why have we never seen cases of microcephaly before associated with the Zika virus? There were not a lot of previous cases in pregnant women occurring at the same time. If only 5 percent of those infected have children with microcephaly, it would take lots of infections to have the abnormality both detected and related to Zika. Why do we see it now? Because there are so many cases occurring in an area where people are recognizing the disease. If it's occurring in a rural area in central Africa, it may not be recognized even though it's occurring at a low level. Is it common for a virus to exist in low levels for decades and then suddenly spread on a large scale? We've seen this in some other cases. It's really a question of finding a happy situation for transmission -- everything is really related to transmission and susceptibility. We'd seen Ebola outbreaks before, but never to the extent that we saw it in West Africa last year simply because it was allowed to move into urban areas. Once a virus goes from benign to 'spreading exponentially,' what comes next? Sooner or later -- often sooner, with something that's transmitting to this extent -- you're going to hit what we call ""exhaust susceptibles."" The virus is going to peak and then start going down. So that's when you see that there's crowding of susceptible individuals living in areas where vector control is difficult. It will almost certainly peak then. Do you think we've reached the peak point yet for the Zika virus? We'll see. There have been certain places where there have been intense transmission -- extreme levels have been seen in crowded disadvantaged areas of Brazil. But it's going to continue to be a problem in more suburban or rural areas. How do you think this outbreak will play out the U.S.? We're going to see occasional introductions into the United States. There may be localized transmissions in the Southern U.S. if there are introductions, but it's unlikely to spread beyond those areas and it probably will be fairly easy to control because we've got the infrastructure to do it. What's the best response, on both an international and a local level? In an area where transmission is taking place, aggressive mosquito control. In areas where transmission is not taking place, delaying travel for those pregnant to known infected areas.This interview has been edited for length and clarity. ","huffingtonpost","left","16830","zika",811
"The Zika virus has a long history in India, so there is much concern about the current outbreak, even though the region primarily affected is in South America, and Asia has not been affected much yet.A few cases of infection have now been reported in Thailand and Indonesia, heightening the concern of Indian officials, especially given the large number of virus-carrying mosquitoes in the country, alongside dense human populations.""In India particularly there is a great threat of the Zika virus spreading quickly given the presence of the Aedes mosquito and favorable environment,"" warned infectious disease specialist Om Shrivastav, as AFP quotes. ""It would definitely be a big challenge for Asian countries to control the spread of the virus  considering high population in the region.""Shrivastav is based in Mumbai, which is also home to Dharavi, the biggest slum in Asia. ""More than half of Mumbai's 20 million inhabitants live in slums - at least one million reside in Dharavi alone - enduring cramped conditions, poor ventilation and a lack of toilets,"" AFP notes. These conditions become particularly Zika-friendly during the summer monsoon season, when heavy rains flood the slums, leaving pools of standing water where mosquitoes can flourish.Other experts AFP cites warn that Zika is difficult to track under the best of conditions, and would be extremely difficult to monitor in the Mumbai slums, given that a large percentage of human carriers display no symptoms.The Times of India cites the huge swarms of mosquitoes around the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai as a particular concern and reports the state Health Department is intensifying ""entomological surveillance"" around the airport.""Zika virus has the potential to spread given the geographical distribution of the mosquito vector, a lack of immunity among people and the high volume of international travel in Mumbai,"" declared health official Kanchan Jagtap, adding that the airports in Pune and Nagpur would also be given extra attention.The Times of India notes that mosquito populations have been considered troublesome around the Mumbai airport for many years, with a 2011 Health Ministry report finding the disease-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito breeding far above ""high and problematic"" levels.At the end of January, India issued a travel alert, warning pregnant women against traveling to Zika-affected countries. Zika screening for travelers returning from affected regions has already been announced, with quarantine facilities available near the major airports, including Mumbai.","breitbart","right","16840","zika",402
"Health officials in Bexar County (San Antonio, Texas) have confirmed they are investigating six cases for the Zika virus in this single Texas county.The six individuals who are being tested for the virus all occurred last week, as reported by NEWS4SA.The test results from the Center for Disease Control are reported to be expected back next week.All of the people being tested for the virus came from South American countries, reports the local media outlet. None of the women involved are pregnant.Health officials say that the danger for contacting the virus is for those who travel to, or are from, Central American and Latin American countries. The virus is extremely dangerous for the unborn babies of pregnant women.Breitbart Texas' Merrill Hope reported on Saturday that Texas health officials are becoming concerned after six cases of the Zika virus have been confirmed statewide. ""We need to find a way to control the spread,"" Dr. Nikos Vasilakis from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston told KHOU CBS11 in Houston.As reported by Breitbart Texas earlier this week, a Brazilian judge has approved abortions for women who have contacted Zika and can prove their unborn has microcephaly or ancenephaly. In Brazil, abortions are only legal with judicial approval.Brazil has launched a door-to-door campaign and is using 220,000 soldiers to combat the spread of the virus, as reported by Breitbart News' Frances Martel. The medical field has recorded more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly in the nation.The Zika virus spreads through mosquito bites, in particular from the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The insect also carries diseases such as yellow fever, Chikungunya, and dengue fever.Breitbart News reported that Brazilian authorities have documented thousands of cases of pregnant women diagnosed with Zika giving birth to babies with microcephaly. Children with microcephaly typically suffer severe mental damage.The ""microcephaly epidemic,"" as it is referred to in an BBC Brasil article, is reported to affect at 20 Brazilian states or more and the federal district. Ancenephaly is a condition in which a fetus is missing a portion of the brain, skull, or scalp. Microcephaly is defined as an abnormal smallness of the head, a congenital condition associated with incomplete brain development.As reported by Breitbart News' Mary Chastain, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned this week that the Zika virus in Latin America has ""explosive pandemic potential.""

The travel warning is especially prominent for travelers who are pregnant or considering pregnancy.""The information was more shocking to both sides,"" Marlins player representative Tom Koehler said. ""Maybe shocking isn't the correct word, but there was a lot more information and data and numbers thrown our way that we didn't have.""Koehler went on to say there has been a request that the games be moved to Miami and the team is expecting a decision soon.There is also speculation that if MLB moves the games, it may set a precedent perhaps impinging on the coming Summer Olympics in Brazil this year.According to the CDC, the Zika virus is very rare in the U.S., but some sources say the mosquitoes that spread the disease will become more common in the U.S. in the near future.In most cases, there are no symptoms after contracting the virus. In a few cases, Zika can trigger paralysis (Guillain-Barré Syndrome) and in pregnant women, it may cause birth defects. Usually it does not result in death.When present, symptoms are mild and last less than a week. They include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes.There's no vaccine or specific treatment for Zika. Instead, the focus is on relieving symptoms and treatment includes rest, rehydration, and acetaminophen for fever and pain.

"The mosquito-borne Zika virus could hit Hawaii especially hard if it arrives in the Aloha State, according to an expert from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.While a widespread outbreak of Zika in the Hawaiian islands remains unlikely at the moment, the state is at higher risk because of its tropical climate and large number of foreign travelers. And many experts are voicing serious concerns about the state's ability to handle such an event, should it occur.Hawaii is already battling its largest outbreak of dengue fever since the 1940s, a disease that is carried by the same species of mosquito that carries Zika.In a December assessment of Hawaii's response to the current dengue outbreak, Lyle Petersen, director of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, said there are ""critical deficiencies"" within the Hawaii Department of Health that should be ""urgently addressed."" ""Introductions of other mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika and chikungunya are likely and will require entomologic expertise at the State Department of Health that currently does not exist,"" Peterson wrote in December. ""I am concerned about staff fatigue and a potential crisis if another health event develops.""As the Honolulu Civil Beat reports, the Hawaii Department of Health is woefully understaffed. Over a seven-year period, budget cuts narrowed the department from 52 vector control workers to 23, and from four entomologists to two. That's fewer vector control workers than most individual counties in Florida, according to the publication. Cities in East Asia of a similar size to Honolulu are expected to have dozens of vector workers.Like dengue and chikungunya virus, Zika is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is found both on Hawaii's Big Island and Molokai. The virus bears extremely mild and short-lived symptoms, but is strongly suspected to be fueling Brazil's dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly, a birth defect that can cause developmental disabilities.While there have been no locally acquired Zika cases in the United States, 31 people have been diagnosed with Zika after contracting the virus overseas and returning home, and one person in Texas has contracted the virus through sexual transmission. Last month, a microcephalic baby was born in Hawaii to a woman who had traveled to Brazil in the early stages of her pregnancy and later tested positive for a past case of Zika, marking the first case of the birth defect in the U.S. that has been linked to the disease. And on Monday, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, in response to the virus. While there is no vaccine for Zika, the designation should help funnel resources to the race to develop one. The CDC said last week an outbreak of Zika in the U.S. is ""likely,"" and the WHO warns it will spread across the Americas. The PHEIC declaration is just the fourth in WHO history, following the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.The steps Hawaii is takingLast week, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) urged Hawaii Gov. David Ige (D) to declare a state of emergency over the dengue outbreak and put additional resources into fighting its spread, including deploying National Guard medical personnel.Gabbard said that what she heard in meetings with local officials on the Big Island is that ""the resources on the ground are not sufficient in a variety of ways.""To assist in the effort, Hawaii lawmakers plan to introduce several bills this legislative session that would allow the Department of Health to address the issue of vector control and establish an emergency fund for outbreaks.Keith Kawaoka, deputy director of the Hawaii Department of Health's Environmental Health Administration, told Hawaii News Now he hopes to fill another 10 vector control positions at a total cost of $500,000 per year. The additional staff, he said, could help the department get dengue under control while preparing for a Zika threat.Kawaoka also told Civil Beat that the DOH is providing local doctors and hospitals with information about how to identify the virus.""I think overall we are very concerned about Zika getting into here and establishing some kind of foothold,"" he said.Ultimately, if an outbreak of Zika occurs in the U.S., it will look much like dengue, according to Jared Aldstadt, a medical geographer at the University at Buffalo.""If you live in parts of Hawaii, Key West or on the U.S.-Mexico border, it's a concern because of the nature of the mosquito, but this is not something that is going to affect large parts of the country,"" he said in a release.

"Doctors have found the Zika virus in placentas of two U.S. women who contracted the virus. They suffered miscarriages after they returned to the states.STAT reported three women suffered miscarriages, but the CDC confirmed Zika in two placentas. The scientists said the miscarriages occurred in the early stages of the pregnancy but did not provide further details.Experts are still working to understand the Zika side effects in pregnancies. Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia have advised women against getting pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.Other doctors have discovered Zika in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly, a rare birth defect that occurs when the brain does not form properly during the pregnancy or after birth. It results in a small head for the child.""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC Director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of claiming Zika caused the microcephaly. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the Zika outbreak, however, Brazil has documented over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases, compared to the 147 in 2014.Doctors reported 404 cases of microcephaly in newborns since November. They tied seventeen ""to the Zika virus."" Fifteen of the 404 passed away, ""with five linked to Zika."" Authorities are investigating 56 other deaths and 3,670 cases.Yale University School of Public Health Professor Albert Ko claims the cases of microcephaly in Brazil are just the start of concerns about birth defects linked to the Zika virus.""It seems like microcephaly may just be the tip of the iceberg,"" he stressed, adding:Microcephaly has received the most attention, but Ko found other problems with the infants.""We're seeing a spectrum. Many have fairly severe central nervous system lesions,"" he explained. ""There are also a lot of calcium deposits  Those can cause seizures and cause impairment in terms of function for the brain.""He added, ""We're also seeing that in some babies, the brains, which usually have wrinkles, are actually smooth.

"On August 30, residents of a neighborhood in Key West, Florida, will head to the polls to vote on a referendum that would kick off genetically modified mosquito testing in the Keys. While the vote is non-binding, the majority of the district's board of commissioners say they will adhere to the outcome of the vote, The Key West Citizen reports.The testing, which would be run by British biotech company Oxitec, would involve releasing about 3 million male mosquitos on a semi-isolated peninsula north of Key West over the course of 22 months.""I think a referendum is great, as long as it is done in an independent way,"" Derric Nimmo, Oxitec's product development manager on the project, told the Associated Press. ""An informed choice is what we want."" But not everyone in the Keys is excited about the prospect of their home being used as a testing ground for GMO mosquitos. The Citizen reported there were 60 anti-testing signs visible in Key Haven, the neighborhood of 444 homes where the testing would take place. The battle about GMO mosquito testing is an ongoing issue in Key West, where in 2012 the city commission passed a resolution to prevent GMO mosquitos being released within city limits (Key Haven is outside of the city-limit boundaries). In the four years since then, a Change.org petition against mosquito testing in the Keys has garnered more than 165,000 signatures, many of them from people who don't live in Key West but feel passionately about GMOs. ""People just don't want to be guinea pigs,"" Mila De Mier, a former nurse and real estate agent who started the petition, told the Miami Herald in March.GMO mosquitos work like this: Scientists genetically alter male Aedes aegypti mosquitos to create ""self-limiting"" strains that only reproduce offspring that won't develop past the pupae stage. The female Aedes aegypti mosquito is the variety that bites and transmits diseases like Zika, dengue and chikungunya to humans, and by effectively ending reproduction in a community, carrier mosquitos will eventually die off.Oxitec has already conducted successful small-scale tests of GMO mosquitos in Panama, Brazil and the Cayman Islands, and the company says that there haven't been any adverse effects to humans or the environment. The FDA confirmed this conclusion with preliminary findings of its own in March, when the agency stated that GMO mosquitos pose no significant danger to the environment.  ""Aedes is generally an invasive species, so removing an invasive species shouldn't have any negative ecological implications in terms of the environment,"" Omar Akbari, an assistant professor at the University of California's Center for Disease Vector Research who isn't affiliated with Oxitec, previously told HuffPost.Aedes aegypti mosquitos cover a wide territory range in the United Sates during the summer, and experts anticipate local Zika outbreaks in humid southeastern states like Florida in coming months.

"The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) says that during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil successfully eliminated the mosquito carrying the Zika virus through the use of DDT.Dr. Anthony Fauci explained at a news conference that Brazil was able to stop the spread of Zika through ""a very aggressive attempt"" to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus.According to CNSNews, Fauci said:Fauci, however, added, ""The mosquito that is the predominant mosquito that spreads Zika is called Aedes aegypti,"" which ""is a very difficult mosquito to control and eliminate.""""It will require a very aggressive, concerted effort,"" he warned. ""Their ability to exist and stay in places that are difficult to eliminate; mosquitoes, for example, they like to stay indoors as well as outdoors, which make the spraying, the outdoor spraying, ineffective for those mosquitoes.""Fauci further explained:""Having said all of that,"" he continued, ""it's still going to be very, very difficult to do.""Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told Breitbart News recently that, if Zika is such a true scare, the government should wipe the virus out completely by lifting the ban on DDT.""DDT was the most effective public health weapon of all time,"" she explained, adding:""Substitute pesticides are far more toxic and expensive,"" Orient adds. ""People are advised to use insect repellents such as DEET - which is absorbed through the skin, and safety in pregnancy is not established.""Pioneer Energy president, Dr. Robert Zubrin, recently echoed the same idea at National Review: ""The most effective pesticide is DDT. If the Zika catastrophe is to be prevented in time, we need to use it.""Orient further wrote at Heartland Institute about the Zika ""scare"":While Orient says Zika - like German measles or rubella - can cause microcephaly, she asserts, ""MOST microcephaly is NOT caused by Zika. About 7 of 10,000 babies born in the U.S. have microcephaly - no thanks to Zika. Most (more than 90 percent) of the Brazilian babies recently confirmed to have microcephaly tested negative for Zika.""The CDC says the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus will move into much of the United States this summer. The agency is recommending Americans ""use an outdoor flying insect spray where mosquitoes rest"" as a means to control the mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus. Inside the home, CDC suggests keeping doors and windows closed and using an indoor flying insect fogger or spray such as those containing Tetramethrin or Imidacloprid.The urgency about the spread of the Zika virus among the Obama administration and its leftwing supporters has indeed been called into question, especially since abortion advocates have attached fears of the virus and its link, in some cases, to birth defects, to the need for more access to abortion in countries that have refused to legalize the procedure.The CDC has recently stated that the Zika virus ""can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, and infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect of the brain called microcephaly and other severe brain defects.""Planned Parenthood - and its colleagues in the fetal tissue business - for their own agenda, have latched onto the message that Zika is an urgent crisis.""Zika has made a long-standing public health crisis impossible to ignore and demonstrates the critical need of government support for sexual and reproductive health care,"" Chloe Cooney, director of global advocacy for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. ""The ability to decide if and when to have children is basic health care, but it's a basic human right as well, and yet it's not realized for so many women across the region, which this outbreak is making so crystal clear.""A special House panel investigating the fetal tissue practices of Planned Parenthood is also scrutinizing StemExpress, the primary biomedical company that has engaged with the abortion business in the transfer of the body parts of aborted babies. The Washington Post reports that StemExpress named Zika as one of the reasons why it requires fetal tissue procurement.","breitbart","right","16928","zika",682
"Lots of panic over the Zika virus right now. Not that I blame anyone. If you can get pregnant, if you have ever been pregnant, there is no more frightening thought than that of your baby being born with some terrible health problem. The emotional impact of what went wrong can be devastating to the mother, but also the father, the whole extended family. The financial burdens of specialized care, for a baby that if they do survive, might not ever be independent. And not everyone has more than one child. So this can also mean the end of a familial line as well in some cases. The Zika virus as it is named as the culprit for the microcephaly is terrifying to women of childbearing age globally.And that's where this thought comes in-Would You Rather Be Happy or Right?There is a lot of speculation about this virus. And one powerful thought to me is the possibility that Agrochemicals might be the actual culprit or at least a co-factor in this cluster.You see, if this is straight up, a mosquito borne virus that is causing these clusters of microcephaly, with no other factors, then we are globally screwed. You aren't going to contain it, you aren't going to stop it. Mosquitoes go everywhere. And since we have a ready-made human reservoir to carry this virus globally in hours (air travel for starters), then infected people, bitten by uninfected mosquitoes can make sure this reaches every shore where mosquitoes and the virus can replicate and flourish.What's the point you are thinking?The point is, that I would hope that chemicals are at least half the cause, because man-made chemicals can be cleaned up, they can be banned from further use. We can control chemicals much easier than we can control mosquitoes. Our only solution at this point for mosquitoes is a chemical version of MAD. That's Mutually Assured Destruction. It won't happen as fast as the nuclear version of MAD, but chemically, we will destroy what is left of our pollinators and turn our rivers and lakes back into toxic oil lamps.We need bugs to pollinate and to support food webs. We need clean air, water and soil for health. And dumping poisons on our own heads to eradicate a bug has never worked out well for us or the ecology of a place. We have history to prove that sad fact. Silent Spring anyone? The DDT Wars?So why would anyone think that chemicals might be the culprit?First lets look at some of the news that comes out of Brazil regarding agrichemicals:Reuters Report: Why Brazil has a big appetite for banned pesticides (2015)Truthout: Rebelling Against Massive Use of Pesticides, Brazilians Shift to Organic Foods (2013)Reports from Brazil show an concerted effort to ban organo-phosphate and especially organo-chlorine pesticides repeatedly.  Several known to be teratogens, and many which are banned in most other countries due to safety issues, or that are heavily restricted.So when I read the Huffpo story yesterday about one singular fungicide being named the culprit, I laughed. Because that story was so disingenuous or perhaps poorly researched, that it was misleading to the public about what the Brazilian people are facing. (anyone who can find this Huffpo post again, please get the link, I could not locate it today.If the Fungicide is a factor, it is mostly due to the fact that it is the latest and greatest chemical in the drinking and bathing water in some communities throughout Brazil. One more layer to that chemical onion if the stories above are any indicator of the state of things in that country.Lets look at what Brazil is trying to ban currently:Abamectin, acephate, benomyl, carbofuran, cyhexatin, endosulfan, phorate, phosmet, heptachlor, lactofem, lindane, methamidophos, monocrotophos, paraquat, methyl parathion, pentachlorophenol, take, trichlorfon.I found additional stories reporting pesticide leaks from a tank of Furadan and the original 2015 story mentioned also that Glyphosphate may be added to the ban as well.As I did additional research I found a story from a Canadian news organization, CBC:Microcephaly cases in Brazil predate Zika virus outbreak, study says (Feb 10 2016)The author of the study started delving into medical records, and discovered microcephaly cases dating back to 2012. She plans to keep digging, to see how far back these cases go. Her next goal is to go through records back to 2011 and 2010. She indicates that the number of reported cases spiked in 2014-Oct or Nov. This changes the timeline a bit. And may challenge the notion that Zika is the only factor in these cases or even the cause of the deformities.In addition to the CBC, the Washington Post also reported on the inflation of microcephaly births.But Zika is present in the babies. Yes it is. But finding mosquitoes in an equatorial region is like finding grains of sand on a beach. They are ubiquitous. And Zika outbreaks have happened all over the globe since it was isolated in 1947, so the presence of Zika and Mosquitoes may not be causal. Even if it was, something has drastically changed to make the virus potent enough to cause deformities where it has not been recorded doing so before, especially at such an unprecedented scale. Usually Microcephaly is associated with nuclear radiation and sometimes lead poisoning or fetal alcohol syndrome.Dr Mattos announced something else in this article:""Scientists think the original report of 4,700 suspected cases were inflated by over-reporting that didn't stand up when specialists examined the babies. Brazil's ministry of health said Tuesday that 404 cases have been confirmed as involving microcephaly, or other nervous system disorders, and 709 have been ruled out. The other cases remain under investigation. (CBC)""The CBC article also pointed out that 80 percent of the suspected microcephaly cases are confined to Brazil's northeast region. A German epidemiologist, Dr Zink stated in the Canadian piece: ""I would ask my toxicological colleagues in Brazil to please look very closely into the practical applications of agrochemicals in their country."" (CBC)What's going on in the Northeast Province of Brazil? Intensive Agriculture. Soy, corn, coffee, cotton, sugar cane, cocoa, and other fruits are produced there. The government built a series of irrigation canals for agriculture because the Northeastern Province was prone to droughts. People who live there also get their water from these canals. Water full of agrichemical runoff (Reuters). That's also when I learned that Brazil actually uses more pesticides per capita than the United States. Yikes! That's saying something. And that it overtook the US in pesticide applications in 2008. I also learned that Brazil seems to suffer from a similar political problems regarding enforcement and regulation. The US does not own the market on revolving door idiocy. Below is a quote from the Truthout story about the affects of these chemicals on the people who live near and around these big plantations and farms.""Some of the most serious effects include neoplasms, defects in the central nervous system, while the more subtle problems are the neurological development of a child, changes in kidney (health), and sexual functions, and cancer,"" said Koiffman. He added that more recently, researchers have noted that exposure to pesticides during pregnancy affects the fetus as well."" (Truthout 2013)Keep in mind, this isn't a middle class neighborhood in America where the only chemicals you are exposed to are the ones on your lawn, or your conventionally grown apples. These are people who work in these plantations and who live right next door. We know that farm-workers and neighbors of Big Ag often suffer the most chemical exposures out of a population except for maybe military personnel and exterminators. The Truthout story covered communities in Santa Maria, which is in the South of the country-this predates the microcephaly outbreak by at least one year. Reuters covered the Northeast primarily. Limoeiro do Norte specifically.The Reuters piece reports the following problem in one community:""Problems along the plateau emerged as early as 2008. Agricultural workers and neighbors of farms began complaining to local church officials, and labor organizations that they were developing rashes after taking showers, while their farm animals were getting sick."" (Reuters 2015)So now if we add a fungicide to that water-do you think that might be a problem? And does that sound more serious when considered in this context than if we imagine that it is a singular additive used alone?What's the big deal fungicides? I mean they kill only fungus right? Check out this report about Brazilian OJ arriving in the US and found to be contaminated with a fungicide banned for food products in the US. It's a metabolite of Benomyl and  destroys the testes of lab animals. mmm Breakfast of Champions! In Australia it was tied to a cancer cluster, and like it's parent-product, benomyl caused the birth of a child with no eyes. (Sydney Morning Herald 2009) Fungicides can be bad for people.On the whole, we know a little bit about acute pesticide exposure involving singular agents, but precious little research exists exploring what happens when we mix them willy nilly in a water supply and then subject local residents to sublethal, chronic exposures to multiple agents. Before you look down on the people of Brazil, notice that we have similar problems here. Ignorance perpetuated by greed. We know next to nothing about the affect of singular or multiple pesticides on gravid women and developing fetuses. We don't even know much about what drugs do to women and foetal development, because we aren't officially supposed to experiment on them-it's considered unethical. Dumping it in their water and on their heads though-that's okay for money in this country and in Brazil. I mean we make a big deal about the Toxins in cigarette smoke for pregnant women and their babies. Which is to say, whatever toxins you introduce into a body that goes to the developing foetus, it doesn't take much once it get's past the placenta.Reuters also reported a problem in Northeast Province:""Tropical Nordeste, a plantation that exports bananas to Europe, recently won a prize from a foreign buyers association for excellence. In October, a worker at the plantation posted on facebook, photos he took of a leaking pesticide tank at a warehouse."" (Reuters 2015)The tank that was leaking, was full of Furadan. A carbamate known to cause birth defects in the lab, specifically it affects neurological development in fetus and infants. (Panna Oregon Post) Its also a systemic pesticide meaning it cannot be washed off (Science Daily).But lets look at those other chemicals. Why is this important to look at it in regards to the Zika outbreak? Many pesticides have one thing in common-- when humans suffer acute exposure or chronic, sublethal exposures, then suppressed immune function can result. This could allow the Zika virus or some other disease vector to cross the placenta and directly affect cell division in a developing blastocyst or fetus. This is without taking into account that it may be purely chemical, and that these cases of deformity, could be the result of a manmade teratogen.Methamidophos was listed a teratogen in a Florida case involving three farm workers who gave birth to babies with unusual deformities.  This case was covered by the CDC and NCBI. I found a more detailed story on these cases from The Ecologist.Benomyl was associated with women who gave birth to babies without eyes. This has happened in the US, Canada, New Zealand and Britain. Another aspect to these legal cases here. Cyhexatin was banned in 1988 due to links to birth defects (PanPesticide Poster UK) It was also listed in the Birth Defect Prevention Act of 1984 in the California Legislature.  Also listed in the California document are Coumaphos (popular with bee keepers), and Parathion. The Nation has a story in 1987 about Cyhexatin and birth defects as well via the LA Times. And Dupont recalled Cyhexatin voluntarily in Sept of 87 due to fear of birth defects. None of these announcements specify what kind of birth defects.""The Environmental Protection Agency warned pregnant women to avoid exposure to the pesticide cyhexatin, saying it may pose a risk of birth defects to their unborn children. Pregnant women should avoid working in fields where the pesticide has been applied, and women of childbearing age also should avoid exposure to the pesticide, the agency said. Dow Chemical Co and Chevron Chemical Co., the registered marketers of the product, told the EPA they were withdrawing all cyhexatin products from the market for the rest of this growing season, except for those used on apples and citrus."" (1987)Endosulfan is a xenoestrogen. The Scientific American compared it to DDT. Endosulfan accumulates in fat, meaning that women will carry a higher load when exposed. Though males suffer delayed sexual maturity and other reproductive effects and it has been linked to reduced size in ovaries and follicle death, studies are also beginning to show potential links to genotoxicity and immunosuppression.  (see here).monocrotophos has been linked to pesticide poisoning in Brazil and Paraguay, specifically the paralysis in children. Similar report from ToxipediaParaquat and Atrazine are being blamed for a spike in Birth Defects in Hawaii. (The Guardian 2015)Nelson, the pediatrician, points out that American Academy of Pediatrics' report, Pesticide Exposure in Children, found ""an association between pesticides and adverse birth outcomes, including physical birth defects"". Noting that local schools have been evacuated twice and children sent to hospital because of pesticide drift, Nelson says doctors need prior disclosure of sprayings: ""It's hard to treat a child when you don't know which chemical he's been exposed to."" (The Guardian 2015)See Also Pesticides and reproduction-Women Farmers in Indonesia by PanPesticide Network UK. This paper contains a list of pesticides especially dangerous to women, which in turn can equate to birth defects in pregnancies-seeing how women get pregnant and all.A breakdown of those pesticides cross referenced with the list from the document from Brazil: Benomyl-birth defects in lab tests; Endosulfan-reproductive effects; Phorate-birth defects in lab tests; Parquat-foetal toxicity; Lindane-reproductive affects, foetal survival issues; Methyl Parathion-birth defects in lab tests. Because this other list is from Indonesia, banned substances in that area are not listed. It goes to show, trying to run down all these reports, is very time consuming, because you must gather it in the aggregate, there are few places that give you even half of the information I am looking for.Texas Town inundated with health problems due to Pentachlorophenol pollution. Toxic Town:Cancer and Birth Defects in Somerville. See also Toxic Town, Birth Defects-both carried by the Houtson Press. Once again, you have to put the pieces together. Finding first hand accounts from reputable sources about various pesticides, is a real pain in the ass. But a human is a human, whether they live in Texas or Brazil. New Jersey has a lot to say about  Pentachlorophenol including it is a known Teratogen and Carcinogen.Trichlorofon is a known mutagen and a possible teratogen.Many pesticide studies will state that fetal effects only happen at levels that are poisonous to the mother as well. That sounds safer, but when you consider the level of unintended chronic exposure in water ways due to runoff or illegal dumping or improper application or over-spray, that doesn't seem so far fetched. Taking into consideration, that we have very little knowledge about how these compounds and their metabolites mix and create new issues-the medical personnel looking into this microcephaly cluster, have their work cut out for them.Meanwhile, here in the North (Americas) we seem intent on telling everyone what the source is and isn't. The Medical people in South America have more riding on this, than we do, because whatever this is, it's already there and reeking havoc on their population. So they have a powerful incentive to get to the bottom of things fast.The Buenos Aires  Herald reports that they have found links to the Microcephaly clusters and the application of Pyriproxyfen. It's a larvacide for mosquitoes added to the water directly to control hatching and disrupt the life cycle.  Over-- or Up here, people have gone nuts blaming vaccines, and Monsanto, etc., Seriously, I would take the people who live and work their seriously, but leave the really wild speculation at the door. We can get to blame later. Right now we are looking for a source right here-right now.A similar story from an Argentinian Television Station-English Translation""Previous Zika epidemics did not cause birth defects in newborns, despite infecting 75 percent of the population in those countries,"" the Argentine report said. ""Also, in other countries such as Colombia there are no records of microcephaly; however, there are plenty of Zika cases."" This content was originally published by teleSUR at the following address:  "" If you intend to use it, please cite the source and provide a link to the original article. www.teleSURtv.net/englishDr Mattos reports that microcephaly cases spiked in 2014 which coincides with when this larvaecide was added to the water. It may not be the larvaecide alone. It could be that + other residues, that weaken the body and allow the Zika virus to do more damage than it normally would. This is a common insecticide used to control the growth rate of fleas and other pests in houses. I have used it as spot treatments for fleas in the house. However, I have not used it while pregnant and certainly to my knowledge I have never drank it mixed with my water. There is panic in South America too. People with an abundance of caution want to find a way to stop this, and others feel that without 100 percent proof that any action taken is premature and illogical. Who takes precedence? The pregnant women who are being terrorized or people who don't have so much skin in this game? You cannot imagine the terror of being told something could be wrong or go horribly wrong with your pregnancy. I would not blame those women and their families if they put an all stop on all chemicals and demanded imported bottled water until tests confirm or deny chemical factors.All the ivory tower arguments are meaningless to people in the trenches right now.I will repeat. I hope there is a chemical factor at work here, and not just a virus. We can clean up chemicals. Controlling a mosquito borne virus is another thing entirely. Judging from what I can find on the net, from mainstream news sources, there are plenty of chemicals to consider, alone and in concert with one another.Good luck to the Doctors and Scientists who are working on finding the source.","dailykos","left","16848","zika",3148
"Zika is affecting people in the US, and it is just the beginning of a global crisis that is here to stay. It is more then just a virus, Zika is affecting female dignity and freedom of choice, putting at risk women's health, future family life and, in many cases, perpetuating the poverty cycle for families in developing countries. Current pro-life policies that are influenced by religious views in many South American countries do not allow abortion except for the cases of rape or a pregnancy which can cause health issues to a woman.  Many of these countries today are waking up to realization of an underestimated danger of the Zika virus. A major wake up call is the fact that World Health Organization recently announced a global emergency situation in relation to Zika. Brazil's health ministry alone reported 270 cases of microcephaly, which is a birth defect in newborn children caused by Zika virus, since September. Things are getting worse rapidly as a first baby with a Zika virus-linked birth defect was born in New York City area Tuesday. The baby girl was born in New Jersey with a partially developed brain due to the virus, according to FoxNews.com. The infant's 31-year-old mom contracted the mosquito-transmitted virus while in Honduras, doctors at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey reported.In these circumstances, United Nations' representatives suggested an adoption of abortion and contraception policies in the countries where the virus is concentrated.  The High Commissioner for Human Rights of UN, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, stated: ""Laws and policies that restrict her access to these services must be urgently reviewed."" However, Al Hussein also explained that the call of some governments for women to postpone their pregnancy might not be effective simply due to the fact that ""many women and girls simply cannot exercise control over whether, when or under what circumstances they become pregnant."" This makes abortion a corner stone question that is becoming increasingly controversial, building pressure on the government officials of South American countries to pay more attention to the spread of Zika.Another concern that scientists have today is that the disease now is proved to be transmitted not only through mosquito bites but also through sexual contact, saliva and urine, which was established by the findings by Oswaldo Cruz's foundation in Brazil. Today in Brazil, one the countries where Zika virus is highly concentrated, abortions are allowed only in cases of rape, anencephaly (fetus is missing a part of a brain or skull) and when a pregnancy can cause danger to life of a woman. Recent findings make the situation even more complicated. If a woman gets infected early during pregnancy, the tests do not show Zika birth defects in fetus until after 20 weeks. After such a period the abortion is considered a late abortion, and therefore has a higher risk to cause damage to woman's health with higher costs. Today a large number of countries forbid abortion after a certain number of weeks. The pro-life basic premise is that after the brain of a fetus is formed, it should be treated as a patient, and therefore simply ""erasing"" the fetus cannot be viewed as the right solution. Even though the Zika issue is predicted to cause significant economic and social consequences, especially for less protected populations of developing nations in Central and South America, religious leaders do not accept the concept of abortion. Pope Francis in his recent interview with CNN on this topic fiercely opposed the idea, stating: ""It is to kill someone in order to save another. This is what the Mafia does."" ""On the other hand, avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil,"" the Pope continued. Therefore, even the head of Catholic Church doesn't view the prevention of pregnancy as an act against the Christian religion. This winter, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned pregnant women to avoid traveling to areas where Zika is spreading, such as South America and Central America. However, the rapidness of the outbreak leaves many unaware and unprepared for the severity of the consequences of this global threat. The situation causes a lot of distortion for women in their personal and social life, shaking some of the most essential priorities, values and beliefs.","huffingtonpost","left","16955","zika",733
"      The Zika virus outbreak is unprecedented and the complications suffered by affected families are hard to bear. We are still in the early days of understanding exactly how this virus gained a foothold in South America. However, genetic analysis of Zika virus suggests that it arose from a French Polynesian strain (1). There have been suggestions that an infected traveler who arrived during the World Cup may have unwittingly introduced the virus to South American mosquitoes (2), although this would have been an African, not Asian lineage. The route of entry that Zika virus used is currently unknown.      However, the World Cup isn't the only event that is temporospatially associated with the current outbreak. In fact, a British company named Oxitec had been experimenting with the release of transgenic mosquitoes prior to this outbreak as a method to suppress disease carrying mosquitoes (3). They were successful in suppressing the local Aedes aegypti population by 80-96% in multiple villages. The exact locations where mosquitoes were released are not clear, but they include some areas of the city of Juazeiro, northern state of Bahia, the Itaberaba district, and the districts of Mandacaru, and Manicoba. Oxitec is currently running a mosquito farm in Juazeiro that rears millions of transgenic mosquitoes per week. A map with pins for each of these locations is shown below in Figure 1: Figure 1. Regions where transgenic mosquitoes were released prior to the current Zika virus outbreak.      These trials began in 2013 and some work has also occurred in Panama. The first cases of Zika virus occurred in the Rio Grande do Norte and Bahia states in 2015, and soon after it was apparent that this outbreak was unique. Zika virus in Brazil is associated with an increased chance of giving birth to a microencephalitic child. The regions where these cases of microencephaly were first observed can be seen in Figure 2. There is a clear temporospatial association between the release of transgenic mosquitoes and the Zika virus outbreak. That said, media outlets are hailing Oxitec's efforts to continue suppressing South America's mosquito populations and are calling for increased funding (4). Figure 2. Regions where Zika virus-associated microencephaly first appeared.       To be clear, I am not suggesting that the release of transgenic mosquitoes was responsible for the Zika virus outbreak. There isn't enough data to make that assertion. However, there is also too little data regarding the safety of releasing transgenic mosquitoes in the wild.Here are two worst case scenarios:1) Release of transgenic mosquitoes leads to a genetic bottleneck, essentially creating a low diversity population of local mosquitoes that are uniquely susceptible to infection, which increases rates of human disease. 2) Viruses replicate in the transgenic mosquitoes and novel mutations are selected that make the pathogens more virulent. The viruses are then passed onto the local mosquito population and a more virulent pathogen persists in nature.       Primary literature assessing the ecological interactions that take place during release of transgenic mosquitoes is scant and has been rolled out largely in the last 5 years. No research has been done to assess how these mosquitoes will effect viruses in the ecosystem in the long-term. I think this is critical since these techniques do not eliminate all of the local mosquitoes or all of the viruses. What type of mosquito or virus is left afterwards? How do they behave when we discontinue treatments with transgenic mosquitoes? These are unanswered questions.      I think that the current outbreak should give us pause regarding use of transgenic mosquitoes, rather than emboldening us to spread them across the globe. I want to stress once again that this article in no way proves that Oxitec's transgenic mosquitoes caused the Zika virus outbreak. However, there is a close enough temporospatial association that the hypothesis requires a deeper investigation. Thoughts? ","dailykos","left","16828","zika",622

But Senator Grassley doesn't see it that way -- instead of working across the aisle on commonsense solutions to address the looming threat of Zika, he chose extreme partisanship.

"As temperatures rise in the United States and mosquitoes become more active, public health officials warn that insects carrying the Zika virus are going to start infecting Americans in the southern and southeastern states. But nearly four months after the Obama administration requested $1.9 billion to try to stop the epidemic in its tracks, Congress has failed to do anything at all about Zika. ""People hear the House passed one thing, the Senate passed something else. What that means is nothing has passed. Not a single penny has gone out of the Capitol to fight Zika,"" Ron Klain, the administration's former Ebola response coordinator, told The Huffington Post this week. ""Now there's a conference committee that's going to have to try to reconcile these bills. Well, the mosquitoes are not going to wait for the conference committee, OK? It's June. Temperatures are rising."" Zika, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes or through sexual contact that has been linked to devastating birth defects, has already caused thousands of babies to be born with abnormally small heads and severe developmental disabilities throughout South and Latin America. While the several hundred confirmed cases of Zika in the continental U.S. thus far were all contracted overseas, Klain said that's going to change in the very near future as mosquito season ramps up.""We're going to see people catch Zika in the United States who've never traveled, never gone overseas,"" he said. ""We're going start to see this happen in the next few weeks while Congress is busy debating this... The majority [in the House and Senate] is preventing a response from being mounted that could help save American lives and prevent this horrible tragedy of babies being born with Zika-related microcephaly."" Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and his Democratic colleagues have been pushing to fully fund the administration's request, and the GOP-controlled Senate was able to agree on and pass a bill appropriating $1.1 billion for Zika. But the bill the House passed would give the administration less than half of that, and Congress left for vacation on May 27 without passing a compromise bill. Coons, who was closely involved in the response to the 2014 Ebola crisis, even visiting Liberia in the midst of the deadly epidemic, ripped into his Republican colleagues this week for their lack of response to Zika and other major public health crises. ""Take a look at three different public health challenges facing our country right now: water pollution in Flint, response to a nationwide heroin and opioid addiction crisis, and responding to Zika,"" Coons said. ""All three of these are issues where we've moved forward responsible funding proposals to resolve them, and they've been bottled up on the floor of the Senate for months.""""It ought to outrage the American people that our Congress -- and in particular, Republicans in Congress, just to be blunt -- are not agreeing to fund things that historically we would have been able to achieve quick, bipartisan, responsible answers to,"" he went on. ""Because these are legitimate public health concerns."" Instead of funding Zika prevention efforts using emergency appropriations money, Republicans in Congress have suggested that the more fiscally responsible move would be to take money that's been designated to fight Ebola and put it toward Zika prevention instead. Democrats and public health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention strongly object to that idea, because the Ebola epidemic is not yet completely under control in West Africa and could easily pose a worldwide threat again.""We narrowly avoided a global epidemic of Ebola,"" Coons said. ""It almost broke out. And so to take the funds that are dedicated to an ongoing response, both in the United States in our public health system and in West Africa, and move it over to a response for Zika -- while I understand the temptation to be fiscally conservative, [it] misunderstands what public health emergency response is all about, which is getting ahead of the problem.""Last week, the first baby with Zika-related microcephaly was born in the continental United States. Each child with microcephaly is expected to cost the health care system up to $10 million. ""The babies who are going to be born with this disease, this horrible impairment of microcephaly -- they are going to suffer from this for however short or long their lives are,"" Klain said. ""And they are going to be a sad human testament to the refusal of some in Congress to fund what we need to do to prevent it.""Videos produced by Christine Conetta.","huffingtonpost","left","16962","zika",780
"Sen. Roy Blunt said negotiators are nearing a deal that would partially fund President Obama's $1.9 billion request for emergency spending to combat the Zika virus at home and abroad.The emerging compromise by Mr. Blunt, Missouri Republican, and Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, would allow senators to vote on $1.1 billion in Zika funding as an amendment to one of the fiscal 2017 spending bills.The package will not be attached to the energy and water bill that is on the floor now.""We should be able to lock that down before too long,"" Mr. Blunt said in a brief interview.For months, the White House has pushed for $1.9 billion to gird for Zika, a mosquito-borne illness that causes birth defects, saying that is what's needed to develop a better diagnostic test and vaccine for the disease, while boosting mosquito control efforts in the states.It also wants to backfill nearly $600 million it shifted from other accounts to prepare for Zika right now, including $510 million from the fight against Ebola in West Africa.

Rick Scott lobbied for funding on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, saying his state will be at the epicenter of any outbreak because of its warm and wet climate.The looming hurricane season will only make things worse, he said, and many travelers will stop through his state on the way to the Olympic Games this August in Brazil, where Zika is swirling and causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads.Mr. Scott said he did not know if $1.9 billion or $1.1 billion was the correct amount to fight the threat. He just wanted Congress to free up money now.""This is an urgent need for our state,"" he said. ""What's important to me is we get together now to get it done.""Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, has called on Congress to fund the full $1.9 billion request, so long as all of the money is spent on Zika efforts.Rep.

"Forcing Puerto Rico to cut spending to deal with its debt could end up leaving the island territory even more vulnerable to the Zika virus, congressional Democrats warned Wednesday.Rep. Raul Grijalva, Arizona Democrat and ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, said Puerto Rico has already started scaling back its health services to deal with $72 billion in bond debt.He warned Republicans on Capitol Hill that requiring deeper cuts will result in even fewer services, which means even less ability to fight the mosquito-born virus that's infected nearly 600 island residents, and killed one.""As Congress considers legislation to help Puerto Rico emerge from this humanitarian crisis, further austerity measures must be off the table,"" Mr. Grijalva said in a 12-page report. ""A robust public health infrastructure and health care system are essential in fighting threats like Zika and recovering the economy.""The Natural Resources Committee is trying to break through opposition from both parties and pass a bill designed to rescue Puerto Rico from its debt by imposing a fiscal oversight board and establishing mechanisms for the island to restructure its debts.Republicans say the holdup is with the Obama administration, which is ""still negotiating"" the bill. The administration says that's a smokescreen, and the real hurdle is internal GOP fights.

""Unfortunately, similar control boards elsewhere have done so by imposing more budget cuts. Given the suffering Puerto Rico has already endured, further austerity could have tragic consequences, especially as Zika gets a foothold on the island.""The report cited an uptick in malaria and HIV cases after Greece tried to reel in its own debt crisis with austerity measures. Also, it said a state manager's attempt to save money by switching the city of Flint's water source to another Michigan river caused lead to leach from pipes, poisoning the drinking water.A spokesman for Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop, Utah Republican, declined to comment on the Democrats' report, saying his office would have to review it.Though Democrats and the White House have alluded to Puerto Rico's Zika plight before, they are increasingly using the burgeoning epidemic as a cudgel against Republican leaders who are still whipping support for their debt bill.Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew hit on the Zika theme on Monday, saying Puerto Rican hospitals have laid off workers and rationed services.""Moreover, despite the intensifying threat from the Zika virus, financial constraints have made it extremely difficult to counteract,"" he wrote to congressional leaders. ""Unsealed septic tanks, abandoned homes, cemeteries, and piles of old tires, where mosquito larvae grow, for example, must all be treated, but the government is struggling to pay for the work to be done.""The push comes amid a series of bleak headlines from the island.

"Brazilian officials have reported two cases of Zika infections through blood transfusions in Campinas, 62 miles northwest of São Paulo.Campinos Health Secretary Cármino de Souza said the government were not previously able to confirm the infections ""because they were initially suspected of being infected with dengue, another mosquito-borne virus."" The two patients received the blood transfusions in early 2015. From The Wall Street Journal:The officials confirmed Zika in the donor's blood on January 28, 2016.Another donor from May tested positive for Zika, but ""the recipient of the contaminated blood has not developed symptoms of the virus.""""The capacity of Zika to spread through blood transfusions needs to be evaluated, as well as the blood protection measures that should be adopted based on the new findings,"" stated the Brazil Health Ministry.The news comes only hours after the U.S. Red Cross urged people not to donate blood ""if they traveled to Latin America or the Caribbean in the past 28 days."" They advised people who have donated blood to alert the organization if they develop Zika symptoms.""The American Red Cross is dedicated to providing the safest, most reliable blood products possible to patients in need,"" stated Susan Stramer, vice president of scientific affairs. ""The Red Cross continues to use safety measures to protect the blood supply from Zika and other mosquito-borne viruses.""The American Association of Blood Banks also recommended people should not donate blood for 28 days.Aedes aegypti mosquitos carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations (Chile and Canada are the exceptions). They also carry Dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya. Doctors found the disease in one infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.Last week, spokeswoman Tara Goodin told the media the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies are working ""to rapidly implement appropriate donor deferral measures for travelers who have visited affected regions in order to protect the blood supply in the United States.""She did not specify when the FDA would take action.Canadian officials also asked anyone who traveled ""outside Canada, the continental U.S. and Europe"" not to donate blood for 21 days. The countdown begins on the day the person returns to Canada.""We've now determined that a 21-day deferral period of time for donors to refrain from donating blood after they've returned from travel to a Zika-risk area,"" explained Dr. Dana Devine, the chief medical and scientific officer of Canadian Blood Services.","breitbart","right","16835","zika",416
"A study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine finds that a website offering clandestine abortion pills and help finding illegal abortion sources in Latin America has seen a surge in demand for their services as the Zika virus outbreak spreads through the region.The website Women on Web, which discreetly provides abortion pills and information on abortion providers in areas with strong pro-life laws recorded an 108% spike in the number of people in Brazil, the epicenter of the Zika epidemic, requesting their aid in terminating a pregnancy, and the same number in Ecuador. Other Latin American nations saw an increase of a third in interest in Women on Web's services.""There were huge increases in abortions across the region,"" researcher Dr. Catherine Aiken told the BBC. Aiken criticized nations like Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia where governments warned couples to avoid pregnancy while keeping pro-life laws intact, alleging the suggestion to delay pregnancies caused ""fear, anxiety and panic with no means to act on it.""In an announcement of the new study's publication by Princeton, where the researchers conducted their study, co-author James Trussell argued that the study should push governments to consider expanding legal access to abortions. ""Zika will inevitably spread to other countries where safe abortion is restricted,"" he said, ""Therefore, we must ensure that all reproductive choices are safe, legal and accessible. To do otherwise would be irresponsible public health practice and unjust policy.""In Brazil, where over 3,000 infants have been born with the brain deformity microcephaly - which scientists have affirmatively linked to the Zika virus - abortions are only legal if approved by a judge. Some judges have stated publicly that they consider Zika infection a valid reason to grant a woman an abortion, though this is not universal.Reports have indicated that, as early as February, Brazil has experienced a surge in interest in illegal abortions in women who may have been exposed to the Zika virus. That same month, the CDC confirmed that two women in the United States terminated their pregnancies out of fear of Zika-related brain damage.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have found the odds of having a baby born with Zika-related deformities are about one to fifteen for every 100 births, though many affected children do not make it to term.Fox News notes the study has ""major limitations"" - mainly, that it looked only at one abortion website's change in traffic and requests. ""The research does not answer how many abortions actually occurred in those countries,"" Fox adds. Nonetheless, due to the clandestine nature of many abortions in Latin America, this is the closest to an accurate representation of interest in abortions in the region, researchers argue.Abortion activists have used the Zika epidemic in Latin America to promote widespread access to abortion. In February, Planned Parenthood International published a webpage asking for donations to help promote abortion in Latin America. ""In a region where many women have limited or no access to birth control and 6 countries ban abortion under all circumstances, the stakes are high,"" the website read.  ""Make your emergency gift today to help IPPF/WHR and our local partners empower women with the family planning resources and quality, non-judgmental care they need to make empowered, informed choices during this crisis.""Leftist columnists added their voices to the pro-abortion push. ""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,"" sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy wrote in Brazilian newspaper O Globo.Pro-life advocates have come out against the international push to promote abortion in the region. ""It is shameful that the abortion industry is trying to capitalize on a health crisis by pushing abortion rather than addressing the actual cause of a real problem,"" Americans United for Life President and CEO Dr. Charmaine Yoest told Breitbart News in February. Ana Carolina Caceres, a Brazilian journalist who suffers from microcephaly, wrote that the calls for abortion affected her ""personally,"" and she felt ""attacked and offended.""To some extent, statistics show the pro-abortion campaign has been successful. A May World Health Organization study found that the number of women terminating pregnancies in Latin America surged from 40 to 44 per every thousand pregnancies between 1990 and the present. Between 2010 and 2014, Latin America experienced a 32 percent increase in the number of documented abortions.Scholars have suggested that legalized abortion in nations where Zika has struck before prevented doctors for being able to attribute an increase in birth deformities to the virus. Before the current Latin American outbreak, Zika struck in French Polynesia, where abortion is legal. The government did not document a surge in cases of microcephaly, but Gubio Soares, the researcher who first observed a link between the condition and Zika, suggests the government should study abortion rates there during the Zika outbreak, particularly if there is documented evidence of abortions prompted by neurological defects identified in utero.","breitbart","right","16975","zika",843
"Brazil has become the epicenter of what the National Institutes of Health has deemed a ""pandemic"": the spread of the little-understood Zika virus throughout the Western Hemisphere. Rather than cancel their annual Carnival week, however, most Brazilian governments found ways to cut expenses and incorporate Zika awareness into the party.A number of local governments and event organizers in Brazil have warned that, for the nation's standards, this year might see a reserved Carnival, particularly in the context of the 2016 Olympic Games, set to take place in Rio de Janeiro. Due to a combination of significant economic shortages and tourist cancelations because of the fear of Zika, at least 48 cities nationwide have canceled official Carnival celebrations entirely.Some cities have merely reduced their Carnival budgets, spending more, instead, on promoting the event and education efforts regarding the prevention of Zika. The Aedes aegypti mosquito, common in the region, spreads Zika through mosquito bites, as well as the diseases Dengue, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever. Prevention of these diseases largely depends on ensuring the mosquitos do not find fertile areas in which to reproduce. The mosquitos are particularly fond of warm pools of still water, all too commonly formed in urban areas during the hot Brazilian summer.In Recife, Brazil, where scientists believe up to 100,000 people have been exposed to the Zika virus, property owners who typically rent rooms to Carnival-goers for the week report that business has been, at best, sluggish. ""There is a high number of dropouts,"" one renter tells the national Folha de Sao Paolo. ""In more than 40 years, I do not remember ever having such a bad year.""Another business owner - Ticiane Didier, who rents rooms at a daily rate - tells the newspaper he typically contracts about one hundred employees to take care of his rooms. ""This year, I will not hire more than four.""Carnival, a festival in which many revelers wear little clothing and dance in closed quarters, lends itself well to the spread of a disease like Zika. Nonetheless, while Carnival officially begins Thursday, many partiers have already taken to the streets of Brazil. Even in these celebrations, however, Zika is present, as the government incorporates awareness campaigns regarding still water sources and insecticides into the events.One enterprising musician even released a love sing titled ""The Zika""; it's about a girl who is so unhealthy for him she might as well be a virus:Independent groups have also taken to combatting Zika through Carnival events. To honor the Olympic games, one group of revelers dressed as Greek gods and marched in Rio de Janeiro singing an anti-Zika song: ""If you leave still water [around]/the larvae grow/from larvae come mosquitos/Leave me alone, Zika! Scare the evil away.""""We wanted to show a different side of Carnival, an Olympic Carnival,"" the organizer of the group, Chico Nogueira, told the Agence France-Presse (AFP).

"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a warning about travel to Cuba after authorities reported Zika on the communist island.The press release came right before President Barack Obama left for Havana.Cuban authorities diagnosed a woman, who did not travel off the island, with Zika after she suffered from ""headaches, fatigue and other symptoms."" A test on Monday confirmed she has Zika. Cuba's other Zika cases came from people who traveled to hard-hit areas, including Venezuela. At least 130 Cubans have shown symptoms.Aedes aegypti mosquitos carry the Zika virus. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations. (Chile and Canada are the exceptions.) They also carry dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya.The CDC recommends pregnant women not travel to Cuba. If a pregnant woman must travel to the island, the scientists said she should talk to her doctor and ""strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites"" during the trip.Zika poses more risks to pregnant women; scientists believe a link exists between Zika and microcephaly, a rare birth defect that occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth, causing small heads. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.Doctors found the disease in an infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of claiming Zika caused the microcephaly cases. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.The CDC also encouraged pregnant women either to not have sex or use protection with their male partners if they traveled to Cuba.In late February, the CDC announced it is investigating fourteen sexually transmitted Zika cases in the United States. Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) confirmed the first sexually transmitted Zika case in the early February. The CDC responded with an advisory for people to take precautions to prevent transmission of the virus. This latest discovery forced the center to issue another Health Advisory Notice (HAN) ""to underscore the importance of adhering to the interim guidance published on February 5."" These include pregnant women asking their male partners about possible Zika contact. They also asked everyone to use condoms until further notice, since no one knows for sure how long Zika survives in sperm.","breitbart","right","16881","zika",424
"HOUSTON, Texas - A woman from El Salvador who now lives in Houston has tested positive for the Zika virus. A representative from the center where she is receiving care said it is unknown whether the woman contacted the virus through a bite from a mosquito or sexual contact.The woman is the first pregnant woman in the Legacy Community Health Center's system that has the Zika virus, reported KHOU11 in Houston. As reported by Breitbart Texas in February, health professionals from just this one clinic in Houston said they were screening about 300 pregnant women per day for the Zika virus. About half of these women are from countries where the Zika virus has been prevalent. The latest report from the center says they are still screening about 300 persons per day.The Zika virus is prolific in El Salvador. The woman came to Houston from the country earlier this year.Dr. Natalie Vanek from the Legacy Community Health clinic told the CBS affiliate in Houston in February, ""We have a lot of patients that come back and forth from these endemic areas, so we feel it's something that we need to do for our patients."" Vanek is an infectious disease specialist.Dr. Vanek also said, ""If there's a concern, we're going to have their blood sent to the CDC for testing and I'm sure OB doctors will be doing frequent ultrasounds on these women.""Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is sending the clinic blood tests, and the clinic is examining the women for rashes, aches, or fever.As reported by Breitbart Texas, health officials say that the danger for contacting the virus is for those who travel to, or are from, Central American and Latin American countries. The virus is extremely dangerous for the unborn babies of pregnant women.Breitbart Texas' Merrill Hope reported on Wednesday that Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) expressed concerns that Zika-carrying mosquitoes could bring the virus from Mexico into the United States. ""It certainly would not be a surprise at all if we see some locally transmitted cases of Zika in Texas,"" said Chris Van Deusen, spokesman for the TDSHS told the Brownsville Herald.Zika is a virus spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has concluded that the virus is a great threat to pregnant women because it is ""a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects.""

"On Monday the Obama administration announced it would ask Congress for $1.8 billion to help combat the Zika virus, elevating national awareness of the disease and heightening fear of its impact. Following news that doctors had diagnosed a Texas patient with Zika through sexual transmission, America's collective hypochondriac exploded. The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness that has been linked to birth defects in many South American countries. While the Ebola outbreak, the last health emergency declared by the WHO, progressed rapidly in those infected and had deadly effects, only one in five patients who contract Zika display flu-like symptoms. Nearly 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. Scientists have linked Zika to the most visible effect of the virus, microcephaly, which causes infants to be born with abnormally small heads, but conclusive evidence has not definitively backed up the correlation. The CDC's full press release advises travel limitations for pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant. Photo courtesy of cdc.gov/zika/geo If you think the CDC's reaction to the outbreak seems extreme when comparing the virus to, say, Ebola, you're not alone. An article in the Independent also points out the distinct differences between the two diseases. However, media coverage of the Zika virus combined with the global health community's response has gotten people talking. On social media, people's reaction is split between fear and trepidation about Zika's severity.  I'll admit to feeling as if I were a mild hypochondriac from time to time. I can't watch House or research headaches on WebMD without suffering a sleepless, anxiety-filled night. The media attention surrounding disease outbreaks like Zika and Ebola play right into those fears. The photos of Zika babies with underdeveloped heads have dominated the Internet and stuck in peoples' minds.""My friend is studying abroad in Brazil and she has mosquito bites all over her leg,"" whispered a girl sitting next to me in class, giggling nervously as she exclaimed, ""She DEFINITELY has Zika.""Another female classmate contemplated delaying a post-graduation trip to Peru because of the outbreak while a third had bigger concerns.USC senior Gaby Smotrys was over the moon when she learned she had been selected to intern in Rio de Janeiro this summer in conjunction with the Olympic games. While she recognizes the threat of Zika, she's not as concerned as the media suggests she should be.""Since it's really just risky for expectant mothers or women who want to be, even if I were to contract it, the health implications wouldn't be that severe,"" she said. Smotrys also commented on how the weather will improve by summer. With Brazil's weather at 80 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 percent humidity now, conditions will be milder by the time the Olympic games happen. Smotrys also thinks that the media is playing less of a role in the hysteria than the health community is.""I would almost say that the WHO and CDC are more fueling hysteria and the media just facilitating it,"" she said.Since this virus affects people in such a comparatively less severe way than Ebola and infects such a specific demographic, why have international organizations reacted in such an extreme way? Fear of global disease outbreaks has dominated America's news and social media consumption for years. Movies like Contagion, The Stand and The Andromeda Strain all deal with how the world would look if a global outbreak killed off large amounts of people. Granted, most of these movies involve zombies or aliens, but the underlying premise is there. According to a 2008 study chronicled by Science Daily, media coverage of disease outbreaks heavily influences how people perceive and fear the symptoms. In addition, Time Magazine published an examination on how social media caused the spread of false information and hysteria during the Ebola outbreak. America's collective consciousness fears global health emergencies because we do not know how to stop them. To wage war against illness you need more than weapons; you need medical innovation. In addition, the Zika outbreak reflects the international health community's efforts to learn from the mistakes it made during its response to Ebola. But Zika is an extremely different illness than Ebola, and should warrant an extremely different global response. One of the major factors impacting the spread of Zika is the vulnerability of poverty-stricken communities who live near open water sources and lack basic resources to fight mosquitoes. Finally, Brazil has a lot on the horizon in the coming year. Having just begun celebrations for Carnival, Rio de Janeiro will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, drawing thousands of athletes and fans from across the world. With security concerns already making headlines earlier this year, a global health challenge is the last thing the country needs right now. I'm not saying we should discount the severity of the effects of Zika, but the virus is a different monster than Ebola was, and Brazil's unique position in the world combined with media hysteria are causing an unwarranted fear of the virus in the United States. The two countries have vastly different infrastructure. The Zika virus poses a unique threat to South America, but hysteria in the US should not be as high as the CDC makes it out to be. Zika is a virus just like dozens of other health emergencies that exist worldwide, and if travelers take necessary precautions it is no more severe than those.","huffingtonpost","left","16842","zika",923
"By Kate Kelland, Health and Science CorrespondentLONDON, (Reuters) - French scientists say they have proved a link between the Zika virus and a nerve syndrome called Guillain-Barre, suggesting countries hit by the Zika epidemic will see a rise in cases of the serious neurological condition.Guillain-Barre (GBS) is a rare syndrome in which the body's immune system attacks part of the nervous system. It usually occurs a few days after exposure to a virus, bacteria or parasite.In a retrospective study analyzing data from a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia during 2013 and 2014, researchers led by Arnaud Fontanet of France's Institut Pasteur calculated the estimated risk of developing Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) at 2.4 for every 10,000 people infected by Zika.""This work is significant because it allows for the confirmation of the role of Zika virus infection in the occurrences of the severe neurological complications that constitute Guillain-Barré Syndrome,"" said Fontanet, Pasteur's head of the emerging diseases epidemiology.""The regions which are affected by the Zika virus epidemic are likely to see a significant increase in the number of patients with serious neurological complications, and when possible, should increase the capacity of health-care facilities to receive patients needing intensive care.""The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus spreading from Brazil an international health emergency.This declaration was largely based on evidence linking Zika to a birth defect known as microcephaly, marked by a small head and underdeveloped brain, but the WHO is also concerned about rising reports of cases of GBS in countries hit by Zika.It is not yet clear whether the Zika virus actually causes microcephaly in babies, but experts say the evidence of a link is growing.Fontanet's team analyzed data from 42 patients who developed GBS at the time of the French Polynesian epidemic and found that every one had evidence of a previous infection with Zika.Tests also showed 93 percent of them had been infected with Zika recently - within three months prior to developing GBS.Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, said the study, published in The Lancet medical journal, ""provides the most compelling evidence to date of a causative link"" between Zika and GBS.""The increase in reported cases of Guillain-Barré in Brazil and other South American countries seems to suggest that a similar situation may be occurring in the current outbreak, although the link here is yet to be proven definitively,"" he said in an emailed statement.According to WHO, even with the best healthcare services available, some 3 to 5 percent of GBS patients die from complications, including blood infection, lung clots, cardiac arrest and paralysis of the muscles that control breathing.(Editing by Gareth Jones)","huffingtonpost","left","16861","zika",484
"The Democratic Republic of Congo has declared an epidemic of yellow fever, affecting the densely populated capital Kinshasa and infecting a suspected thousand residents nationwide.Reuters notes that Health Minister Felix Kabange was quick to use the word ""epidemic,"" which triggers particular safeguards, including testing and vaccinations. Only 67 of the thousand cases known have been confirmed, but the presence of yellow fever in Kinshasa, a city of more than 12 million, means the virus could spread rapidly. DR Congo has a nationwide population of 77 million, now at risk to contract a disease spread rapidly through the mosquito aedes aegypti. The regional newspaper The EastAfrican reports that experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) believe yellow fever has seen a resurgence in the region through ""increased viral circulation among monkeys in forests.""Most of the confirmed cases were from Angola, where the government is also struggling to contain yellow fever. The prevalence of the virus has led to a growing shortage of vaccines, triggering a warning from the WHO to use a fifth of the standard dose of vaccine typically used on individuals. Those vaccinated with a smaller dose will require a vaccine in the future, while the full vaccine is believed to provide lifetime immunity.In Angola, at least 345 people have died of yellow fever in the past seven months. The WHO estimates 3,000 known cases, according to the BBC. Doctors in Angola also note that many yellow fever sufferers also tested positive for another mosquito-borne illness: malaria.Angola has responded to the potential for a larger outbreak with strict travel regulations to keep affected nationals from spreading the virus and visitors from contracting it in Angola and spreading it elsewhere.Yellow fever can be the most serious illness spread through aedes aegypti in severe cases. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), yellow fever causes ""sudden onset of fever, chills, severe headache, back pain, general body aches, nausea, and vomiting, fatigue, and weakness."" It can escalate to triggering symptoms like ""high fever, jaundice, bleeding, and eventually shock and failure of multiple organs."" Up to 50 percent of those whose yellow fever progresses may die.Aedes aegypti is also responsible for spreading dengue fever, chikungunya, and zika virus. In Latin America, populations of aedes aegypti have caused a regional outbreak of Zika virus, leading experts to call for officials to either postpone or relocate the 2016 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil is the epicenter of the current outbreak.""An unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic,"" reads a letter signed by more than 150 medical experts sent to the International Olympic Commission (IOC), calling for the event to be relocated or postponed.While tourists attending the Olympics can carry Zika with them to a previously unaffected area, it is similarly possible that a tourist carrying yellow fever into an area like Rio de Janeiro, known to have high numbers of carrier mosquitos, can introduce that virus into an already vulnerable population.The Brazilian government and the IOC have been adamant that the show will go on, and tourists will be safe from disease. ""We estimate that fewer than one in 500,000 visitors to Rio will contract the Zika virus,"" Brazilian Health Minister Ricardo Barros said in response to critics. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes has called concern over the spread of Zika ""completely crazy,"" accusing those warning that the virus could spread globally of engaging in ""a lot of exaggeration.""","breitbart","right","16973","zika",595
"If there's one thing we know about travelers, it's that they have a lot on their minds. And who can blame them? From terrorist attacks to travel warnings in popular vacation destinations across the globe, there's plenty to cause concern for the wanderlust crowd among us.Sadly, the Zika virus is merely the latest alarm bell for travelers. If you're wondering whether it's a smart idea to modify your plans in light of recent outbreaks, here's what you need to know.The White House has requested $1.8 billion in emergency funding from Congress to combat the virus. A Reuters/lpsos poll released on Feb. 8 found that 41 percent of travelers say they're less likely to travel to Latin America and the Caribbean. And according to the poll, two-thirds of Americans have now heard of the virus, up from 45 percent in January.Most of the concern surrounds pregnant women and birth defects. Brazil's eastern coast is ground zero for the virus, where officials say this year there have been 3,500 reported cases of microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with impaired brain development. That's up from 100 to 200 cases per year before the return of the virus last May. Zika first appeared in Uganda in 1947, but has largely been seen as a minor virus found in Africa and Asia. It was thought to have been eradicated until the recent outbreak of the mosquito-transmitted disease.The virus is spreading largely around warm-weather climates in Latin America and the Caribbean. The virus is carried by Aedes mosquitos, which tend to bite more frequently during the daytime. There is also some research that the virus can be spread through saliva or sexual activity, but for now, the main threat comes from being bit by a mosquito carrying the virus.The 2014 World Cup in Brazil is thought to have been a major cause of the reappearance, as millions of fans worldwide descended on Brazil for the games. For this reason, there is a widespread concern that the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games could have the same impact (though Olympics organizers downplay the threat, pointing out that city workers are destroying breeding grounds and that the cool August temperatures will keep mosquitos away).Beyond Brazil, there are more than 30 reported cases of Zika thus far in the U.S., all from travelers who returned from visits to infected countries. There are two kinds of Aedes mosquitos that could pose a risk to U.S. residents: the yellow fever Aedes and the Asian tiger Aedes. Researchers believe that Hawaii, Florida and destinations along the Gulf Coast are the only U.S. locales warm enough for the yellow-fever Aedes mosquito to thrive though the Zika-transmitting mosquitos have been found as far north as Washington, D.C. in extremely hot weather. Asian tiger mosquitos have also been found in northern cities, such as New York City and Chicago, in the summer.That hasn't stopped the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's command center from declaring a Level 1 alert - a status they have only reached three times: the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, the H1N1 flu crisis in 2009 and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The action not only raises attention for prevention of the virus spreading to the U.S. but also the need for resources to combat the spread of the virus.Pregnant travelers are being advised to avoid travel to the Caribbean and Latin America region, where Zika is currently most prevalent. If you're pregnant and you've traveled to a country where Zika virus has been present in the past three months, the CDC recommends that you consult your doctor. If you've had a fever, rash, joint pain or blood shot eyes within two weeks after returning from traveling to an affected country, your doctor will run a blood test for the virus.In 80 percent of people infected, symptoms never show. But in the worst-case scenario, it's going to feel like the flu. According to health officials, symptoms will usually show between the third and seventh day the virus is in your body. Most people infected recover within seven days as the immune system clears the virus.There is currently no treatment or vaccine against Zika. Researchers are confident they can develop a vaccine by the end of the summer, but for now, the best way to protect yourself is to carry mosquito nets and insect repellant with you if you are traveling to an infected country.A February survey conducted by the Travel Leaders Group, a heavyweight in the travel agent industry, showed that 93 percent of travel agents said they have had no cancelations from clients ages 60 and up. And when it comes to millennials, 74 percent of agents said they had no cancelations with travelers in their 20s and 30s.""Armed with the facts, most travelers are opting to travel even as they heed expert advice for avoiding mosquito bites,"" said Nina Chacko, chief executive for the Travel Leaders Group.Outside of mosquito protection, your best defense as a traveler is to purchase travel insurance. Policies usually run no more than $200 and can protect you against any calamity you may incur during travels, including illness.If you've purchased a trip to affected countries and are too nervous to travel, most airlines -including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines - are offering full refunds to fliers who booked flights to impacted countries.The bottom line: If you're pregnant, avoid travel to Brazil and all impacted countries (the CDC is constantly updating that list here). For other destinations across Latin America and the Caribbean, the Zika threat is no more than any other peril that travelers face. Take precautions, but enjoy your trip.6 Things Every Traveler Should Know About the Zika Virus was originally published on U.S. News & World Report.More from U.S. News:CDC Urges Pregnant Women To Postpone Travel To Avoid Risk Of Zika InfectionInfographic: Should You Get Vaccinated Before Your Next Trip?9 Things To Know To Improve Your Safety When Traveling Overseas","huffingtonpost","left","16849","zika",1019
"Mostly innocuous and fairly unknown until a few weeks ago, the Zika virus is suddenly dominating the news. Under scrutiny is the virus's putative link with a congenital birth defect called microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and undeveloped brains. Two recent publications [1,2] have documented finding the genome of the Zika virus in the amniotic fluid and brains of fetuses affected by microcephaly from three different mothers. These numbers are still too small to constitute a proof, and in fact, alternative theories are already cropping up: an organization of Argentinean doctors has published a report in which they claim that it's not the virus, rather the insecticide used against the mosquitos, that causes the birth defect.But what is Zika and, if the claims about microcephaly turn out to be true, how can it be harmless to most people yet so detrimental to a developing fetus? To answer these questions we have to take a step back and understand how viruses work and why some are endemic in the population, while others seem to come and go in waves. The Zika virus was first isolated in 1947 from a rhesus monkey and from a pool of mosquitos in the Zika forest in Uganda. It belongs to the same family of viruses as dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus. However, unlike its close relatives, Zika was thought to be relatively harmless: most infected people experience no symptoms and a few have just a rash and mild fever. Originally confined to Africa, Zika started expanding to Asia in 2007. Since then the virus has spread exponentially.Viruses like Zika are similar to Ebola in that they replicate in animal populations, where they are endemic. Ebola, for example, usually infects bats and jumps to humans who consume meat from infected animals. Zika is found in monkeys, and both monkeys and humans contract it through bites from mosquito carriers. To evade the host's immune system, viruses evolve continuously: as organisms build immunity to fight them off, genetic changes enable viruses to escape the newly made defenses. Most of the people who contract Zika don't even realize they've been infected. They might just notice a pesky mosquito bite. But that pesky bite hints at the virus's covert strength: once inside the mosquito, the virus becomes an invisible enemy, one that hides and migrates through a tiny insect. You can avoid infected people when you see them sniffing and sneezing, but how do you avoid a symptomless agent that spreads through a flying bug?You don't. In areas where these mosquitos flourish, children get infected early in life, build immunity against the virus, and don't worry about it ever again. Then why is Zika posing a threat now? The problem arises when the virus moves to a new geographical area and encounters a population that has never been infected before. Pregnant women are particularly at risk: unless they've been infected earlier in life, in which case their immune system can clear the infection before it reaches the fetus, any disease agent that has the ability to cross the placenta is a potential threat. That's true of Zika. Despite its normally mild symptoms, when it reaches the completely naïve immune system of a fetus in the early stages of pregnancy it can potentially cause permanent damage. Although the connection between microcephaly and Zika has yet to be confirmed, Los Alamos National Laboratory virologist and epidemiologist Brian Foley does not believe that pesticides are responsible, as hinted by the Argentinean report. ""Of course the insecticide application is slightly correlated,"" Foley says, ""because Zika, dengue, and other similar viruses are spread by mosquitoes. So, wherever you find one, you'll find the other, too. The insecticide mentioned in the Argentinean report has been in use since before 2000 and was heavily tested for mammalian toxicity before being put into use. And it is used all over the world for mosquito control, not just in Argentina and Brazil.""""We can't exclude that Zika is responsible for microcephaly in areas where it has circulated longer. To detect such links takes careful reporting and record keeping, and most countries do not have really accurate reporting to a central database.""The truth is, both the insecticide use and the virus are consequences of a global trend: over the past two decades, vector-borne viruses like Zika and yellow fever have spread globally at an increased rate. Why? That human behavior is once again responsible for this new spread comes as no surprise. Increased traveling between continents, a rapidly growing population and, last but not least, a rise in temperatures have created the perfect conditions for mosquitos--and hence the diseases they carry--to spread virtually unstopped. Humid, densely populated areas riddled with stagnant water become the ideal habitat for these bugs. The race for a vaccine has started, and several companies have already announced a schedule to begin human trials in the near future. Unlike HIV, for which making a vaccine has turned out much more challenging than originally anticipated, the genome of the Zika virus is not very diverse. However, making any vaccine is regulated by strict government safety rules that require years of testing. ""Under normal circumstances, it takes 10-20 years to make a vaccine,"" Foley explains. ""In an emergency situation, they could push it to two to four years. That's still a long time in the event of an outbreak.""It's even longer if you think that Zika may only be the tip of the iceberg of a phenomenon we are bound to see over and over again in the near future. ""The distribution, transmission, and abundance of vectors that bear and transmit diseases are being enhanced by global warming,"" Foley and colleagues state in a recent publication [3]. ""The mean global temperature increased approximately by 1 degree centigrade during the last several hundred years. However, during the next 20 years it is anticipated to increase by 2 to 3 degrees centigrade.""Geographic areas once too cold for mosquito-borne diseases are now seeing an increase in encephalitic viruses, dengue, and West Nile. Similarly, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia are experiencing an increase in typhoid and cholera due to poor hygiene, stagnant water and climate change. So yes, a vaccine can provide a solution. But if this is only the beginning, we need to think globally. It's not just one virus we're fighting but a global change that's happening too fast for the natural world to adapt on its own. Elena E.

"Brazilian health officials are warning pregnant women to seriously consider who they kiss and to use condoms if they have been in countries were the Zika virus is present.""The flurry of recommendations began in Brazil, where a top health official warned pregnant women to be caution with their kisses,"" the AP reported late on Friday,This announcement came at the start of a five-day drunken Carnival festival ""where kissing as many people as possible is a top pastime,"" reported the AP.The guidelines issued also suggested that men use condoms even if their female partner is not pregnant. They also suggested abstaining from sex entirely.Paulo Gadelha, president of the Fiocruz research institute, told reporters at a press conference that scientists have found live virus in saliva and urine, and that the possibility that the Zika virus could be spread by these two body fluids requires further study.He also said that pregnant women should take other precautions to protect themselves and their unborn child, including kissing only a regular partner, and not sharing the forks, knives, glasses, or plates of those who may have symptoms of the Zika virus.Previous reports by Breitbart News confirmed that Brazilian scientists have detected the live Zika virus in human saliva and urine. Their fear is that a person can contract the virus by coming into contact with these fluids.Dr. Susan Donelan, medical director of the epidemiology department at Stony Brook University Hospital in New York was asked about these suggestions to pregnant women. She was reported to say, ""I can understand the Brazilian Health Ministry being concerned about not leaving out any potential mechanism for transmission, even if it's theoretical."" She added, ""Brazil is in a particularly difficult position.""Brazil is believed to be the country hardest hit by the Zika virus, and Brazil's top health official said that the virus is proving worse than believed possible because most cases show no symptoms, Breitbart News reported. The country has launched a door-to-door campaign executed by 220,000 soldiers to combat the spread of the virus. Moreover, more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly have been reported and 200 or more cases are being diagnosed every week, reported Breitbart News.U.N. officials are asking Catholic dominant countries in Latin America to allow pregnant women to have abortions if they fear their unborn child may be at risk for a Zika virus related birth defect such as microcephaly, as reported by the AP. Abortion is not legal in these countries unless a judge signs off on the procedure.At least one Brazilian judge has declared he will approve abortions for women who have contracted Zika and can prove their unborn child has microcephaly or ancenephaly. In Brazil, abortions are only legal with judicial approval, reported Breitbart Texas.As reported by Breitbart News, Planned Parenthood is taking advantage of Zika virus fears to push for the expansion of abortion-on-demand throughout Latin America.Breitbart News has also reported that the fear of an unborn child developing microcephaly or other birth defects due to the Zika virus, has pushed women to get illegal abortions according to the Brazilian daily Folha de São Paulo.The AP reported that the National Conference of Bishops in Brazil did not immediately comment on the U.N.'s suggestion to loosen abortion laws.Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

"President Obama will veto the bill for $1.1 billion to combat the Zika virus if it makes it to his desk, the White House said Friday.White House deputy press secretary Erick Schultz said the House-passed bill, which faces an uphill battle to overcome opposition from Senate Democrats in the upper chamber, is ""woefully inadequate.""""We are disappointed that Republicans turned this into a political exercise,"" he told reporters traveling with the president aboard Air Force One to California. ""This is a conference report that doesn't look like it can even pass the United States Senate.  But if it did, and the president was presented with the bill, he would veto it.""Mr. Shultz said that in the case of the Zika threat, some funding wasn't better than no funding. And he said the White House wasn't afraid of being seen as blocking the $1.1 billion offered by the Republican-run Congress.""It is a public health emergency, and that's all the more reason why it's unfortunate that Republicans want to turn this into a partisan exercise,"" said Mr. Shultz.He gave a laundry list of reasons why the bill was inadequate.Mr. Shultz said that in addition to being short of the $1.9 billion requested by public health officials, the deal also paid for it with cuts to Obamacare and to funding to fight Ebola.""This bill unfortunately includes an ideological rider blocking access to contraception for women in the U.S., including those in Puerto Rico, even though Zika is a sexually transmitted disease and even though it has been transmitted in Puerto Rico. It makes no sense,"" he said.Senate Democrats have cited similar opposition to the bill. ","washingtontimes","right","16975","zika",282
"Organizers of this year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro tried their best on Thursday to make the Zika virus seem not so scary after all.In their final presentation to the International Olympic Committee's executive board before the Games in August, the organizers said the virus would pose no health risk to athletes and visitors. They noted that the Games would take place during the Southern Hemisphere's winter, when mosquito populations plummet. Because of that, a spokesman declared with confidence, the rate of infection from the Zika virus ""drops to very low numbers, very near zero.""With the Games only about 60 days away, the public relations push was expected. And maybe the final sales pitch will make a few more athletes and visitors feel safe.But for at least one American athlete, it was too late.Read more on The New York Times","huffingtonpost","left","16958","zika",164
"Child in Brazil born with microcephaly following Zika infection.The numbers keep growing. As of Thursday, the CDC reports 413 women in the United States known to be infected with the Zika virus. The total number of Zika cases has exceeded 2,100. At the same time, a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that Zika can cause birth defects for women infected during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. And even when those women show no symptoms, their babies can still suffer the most terrible, debilitating effects. In fact, some women didn't even know they'd been infected until it was far too late.Among the cases of microcephaly investigated from January 2016 through April 2016, four patients had laboratory evidence of congenital ZVD; all were born to asymptomatic mothers who were not included in the ZVD surveillance system.In the United States, the score is now three children delivered alive with severe birth defects attributed to Zika infection, and three stillbirths from defects caused by the Zika virus.These numbers reflect poor outcomes among pregnancies with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection reported to the US Zika Pregnancy Registry.Meanwhile, the same Republicans in Congress who were so quick to generate fear over Ebola when they saw it as a potential political weapon against President Obama just can't get all that interested in saving children from Zika.","dailykos","left","16968","zika",228
"President Obama's top public health officials told Congress on Wednesday that there isn't enough leftover Ebola funding to fight the Zika virus and said Republicans will need to find another $2 billion to combat the mosquito-borne illness.Key figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health said they are obligated to keep fighting Ebola in West Africa and that there is no extra money in their budgets - meaning Congress will either have to find places to cut elsewhere or shortchange the anti-Zika effort.Anthony Fauci, the NIH's director of infectious diseases, said he has spent almost his entire Ebola budget and had to shift other money to get a jump-start on Zika - but now they need more money to proceed.""They're going to have to not do other things in order to do that,"" he said.Mr. Obama this week requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding to fight the Zika virus at home and abroad, citing its link to serious birth defects.But powerful Republican lawmakers told him to use about $2.7 billion in leftover Ebola funds first, arguing that the money could be backfilled as needed.""The supplemental you've requested will take time, will probably get mired in controversy and will likely attract many requests for additional emergency funding,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican.He said the administration will come to regret picking this fight. ""We gave you a quick and easy path. You've chosen a much more difficult one that will only slow the response to Zika,"" he said.Mr. Obama has asked for flexibility to tap Ebola funds but hasn't said how much it will be able to sweat out of the existing accounts.""The outbreak is out of the headlines, but there is still substantial effort,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy CDC director. ""The CDC doesn't have that large a balance for Ebola.""Democrats said Congress will have to find the cash somewhere.""We need to both finish the job of responding to the Ebola crisis and act to address the growing threat of the Zika virus. Families' health and safety should not be a zero-sum game,"" the Senate Health Committee's top Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, said at a Zika hearing Wednesday.The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne disease that is fanning across Latin America and has been linked to an uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly. Although the link hasn't been confirmed, U.S. officials have asked pregnant women to defer travel to hard-hit areas such as Brazil.The CDC has reported 82 cases of Zika among travelers who returned to the U.S. from hard-hit countries, although the virus is not being transmitted by mosquitoes within the 50 states.This week, however, the CDC said scientists are investigating 14 suspected cases of transmission between sexual partners.Dr. Fauci said Zika infection usually stays in the blood for seven to 10 days, though it can remain in other parts of the body. One study found that it subsisted in semen in a male subject for 62 days.Some members said the emerging Zika threat and the aftermath of Ebola outbreak show that Congress for years has shortchanged basic research. ","washingtontimes","right","16855","zika",550
"President Obama is threatening to veto the Republican Zika virus funding bill because it doesn't fund Planned Parenthood, which has attempted to develop the narrative that abortion and contraception - which it provides - will curtail the virus' spread.The Obama administration sought $1.9 billion allegedly to fight the mosquito-borne virus which Brazilian officials have linked to a rare birth defect known as microcephaly that can occur when pregnant women are infected.""The virus is mostly seen as a threat to women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant,"" reports the Wall Street Journal. ""It produces mild, if any, symptoms and is believed to be transmitted mainly by mosquito bites.""Republicans agreed to a $1.1 billion funding plan that contains a provision that would block Planned Parenthood - the nation's largest abortion business - from providing birth control to women allegedly at risk of being infected with the Zika virus. Democrats also said they cannot agree to the GOP Zika plan because it involves budget cuts from both Obamacare and unused funds for the Ebola virus.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid called the GOP Zika funding plan ""a narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off women's access to birth control,"" Reuters reports.On Thursday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz called the $1.1 billion plan ""totally inadequate.""""We urge Republicans to stop turning this into a political football and actually get to work, come up with a proposal that's going to serve the American people,"" Schultz said.The Huffington Post targeted the GOP's Zika funding plan as one that ""limits contraception and prevents Planned Parenthood from helping.""According to the report:Planned Parenthood and aborted fetal organ procurement company StemExpress have attempted to set up the narrative that so-called ""reproductive healthcare"" and research using the organs of aborted babies are essential to find a solution to the Zika virus.""Zika has made a long-standing public health crisis impossible to ignore and demonstrates the critical need of government support for sexual and reproductive health care,"" Chloe Cooney, director of global advocacy for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. ""The ability to decide if and when to have children is basic health care, but it's a basic human right as well, and yet it's not realized for so many women across the region, which this outbreak is making so crystal clear.""Both Planned Parenthood and StemExpress have been the subjects of a specially convened congressional investigation that has determined likely violation of federal laws in the harvesting of the body parts of aborted babies for sale.The Washington Post reports that StemExpress named Zika as one of the reasons why it requires fetal tissue procurement.""Many researchers throughout the medical community have shared with StemExpress that their institutions are waiting for the Select Panel to complete its investigation before going forward with additional fetal tissue research specific to the Zika virus and potential treatments,"" said the company, according to the Post.Despite their expressed concern about the spread of Zika, Democrats in Congress rejected a bill recently that would end a redundant Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) permit requirement to spray federally approved pesticides into bodies of water to combat the mosquito that carries the Zika virus.However, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) explained that during the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil successfully eliminated the mosquito carrying the Zika virus through the use of DDT.Dr. Anthony Fauci said that Brazil was able to stop the spread of Zika through ""a very aggressive attempt"" to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the virus and is ""a very difficult mosquito to control and eliminate.""""It will require a very aggressive, concerted effort,"" he added.Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told Breitbart News recently that, in fact, the government should wipe the virus out completely by lifting the ban on DDT.""DDT was the most effective public health weapon of all time,"" she explained, adding:""Substitute pesticides are far more toxic and expensive,"" Orient continues. ""People are advised to use insect repellents such as DEET - which is absorbed through the skin, and safety in pregnancy is not established.""Pioneer Energy president, Dr. Robert Zubrin, recently echoed the same idea at National Review: ""The most effective pesticide is DDT. If the Zika catastrophe is to be prevented in time, we need to use it.""He continued:""Asking 'why' should be the main response to Zika,"" Orient states. ""Instead the advice seems to be: 'Don't travel, don't have a baby, don't let a mosquito bite you, stop climate change' - and give the authorities billions of dollars for a crash vaccine development program.""","breitbart","right","16977","zika",786
"Alleged ties between the Zika virus and increased numbers of cases of microcephaly in Brazilian babies may be due more to hype and hysteria than serious science, according to a recent analysis of the data involved.The notion of a crisis or epidemic sprang from findings of the Brazil Ministry of Health that between November 8 through January 30 an unusually high number of babies-404-were born with microcephaly, a condition characterized by an exceptionally small cranium.In a search for possible causes behind the uptick in microcephaly cases, doctors pointed out that seventeen of the cases correlated to mothers who had been infected with the Zika virus.Yet parsing the numbers involved, scholar Pia de Solenni has pointed out that if only 17 of the cases could be linked to Zika, this represents a mere 4% of the total, suggesting that there must be another cause or causes to explain the higher incidence of children born with microcephaly.In the face of the simple facts, de Solenni asks whether the full-blown embrace of the Zika-microcephaly connection might be pure hype rather than serious science. ""Taken with the fact that authorities are investigating another 3,670 suspected cases [of microcephaly] indicates that this could be hysteria rather than epidemic, admittedly understandable in the current media climate,"" she wrote.Flipping the data around, the scholar noted that 96% of the cases of microcephaly in the numbers cited by the Brazil Ministry of Health were not in any way related to the presence of the Zika virus, meaning that any epidemic of microcephaly must necessarily have another origin.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has admitted its ignorance in the matter, declaring in a statement that ""it is unknown if a positive result [of Zika] is predictive of a subsequent fetal abnormality, and if so, what proportion of infants born after infection will have abnormalities.""Zika itself has been around for decades, and up to now has never been found to correlate to birth defects in children. Its effects are so mild and short-lived that 4 out of 5 people infected with the virus do not even realize they are sick. Symptoms include low-grade fever, maybe a rash, possible conjunctivitis (pink eye), and some joint pain. That's it.The fact that the known ties between Zika and microcephaly are circumstantial at this point has not deterred abortion activists like Planned Parenthood from stoking the flames of panic among pregnant women and exploiting the situation to push for relaxing abortion legislation in Latin American countries where it is restricted.The abortion industry has found its ""silver lining"" in the Zika epidemic and instead of promoting research into remedies to treat or counteract the virus, they have preferred to play into people's worst fears to push for abortion-on-demand in countries like El Salvador that currently restrict or prohibit abortion.El Salvador, in fact, tops the list of countries targeted by Planned Parenthood and other abortion advocacy groups, since it is considered the nation with ""the world's strictest anti-abortion law,"" and thus a permanent thorn in the side of abortion activists.The New York-based pro-abortion Center for Reproductive Rights has even organized an online petition demanding that the government of El Salvador legalize abortion for women who contract the Zika virus.Yet despite the full-court press against Salvadoran pro-life legislation, El Salvador's Ministry of Health reported last week that 13 women infected with the disease had recently given birth to perfectly healthy babies with no signs of microcephaly.The mainstream media have joined the abortion industry in its crusade to have abortion laws relaxed, with headlines such as ""How Anti-Abortion Laws in the Americas Are Fuelling the Zika Virus Epidemic"" (The Independent); ""If Women with Zika Risk Shouldn't Get Pregnant, They Need Abortion Access"" (The Guardian); ""The Abortion Rights Dystopia Brought On by the Zika Crisis"" (Jezebel).Meanwhile, in a typical man-bites-dog storyline, the Catholic Church has come under fire for its consistent pro-life teachings, as if this somehow were the cause behind children contracting birth defects.Maybe when the smoke clears, the real culprits behind the Zika-microcephaly hysteria and needless anxiety for countless women will be brought to account.Then again, probably not.Follow Thomas D.

"A list of people who are not lifting a finger to help Rick Scott.Rick Scott is just one of many Republican governors who took their seat by running against those money-grabbers in Washington, despite the fact that Florida residents get back $4.60 for every $1 paid in federal tax. But even the most state-rightest of state-righters comes hurrying to D.C. when there's a disaster looming. Unfortunately for Scott, his fellow go-it-alone Tea Party pals in the legislature are bottling up funding for Zika. Florida will experience a ""disaster"" with the Zika virus if federal authorities don't immediately provide money to help battle the virus, Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Wednesday.Scott, who had already visited Washington, D.C., in an effort to get Congress to act, sent a strongly worded letter to President Barack Obama asking the federal government to do something. The Republican governor called it ""profoundly disappointing"" that Congress has not taken ""immediate action.""President Obama has been asking Congress to act for the last four months, so hitting him with the ""strongly worded letter"" might not be all that effective. However, at least Scott seems to recognize that the Republican-dominated Congress is the over-sized turd in this pipeline.White House spokesman Josh Earnest responded to the letter by saying that ""we hope that Republicans in Congress will finally get the message"" and approve the $1.9 billion that the president has been seeking. Congress is currently divided over how much money to spend to battle the virus, which can cause grave birth defects and be spread by certain mosquitoes.Divided is one way to put it.

The Congress is divided conservative Republicans vs. batshit Conservative Republicans who don't care how many babies are sacrificed on the altar of their egos. Florida currently has 162 diagnosed cases of Zika, including 38 pregnant women. And just to add a bit of extra-darkness to an already bleak issueHealth officials announced Wednesday that a tourist contracted dengue fever in Key West. The mosquitoes that carry dengue also transmit Zika and other viruses. Dengue is also known as ""break-bone fever"" for the severity of pain it causes. ","dailykos","left","16954","zika",365
"The World Health Organization declared a ""public health emergency of international concern"" on Monday morning due to the clusters of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities that may be caused by Zika virus.This designation, also known as PHEIC, has only been applied to three other illnesses in the past -- most recently to Ebola during the 2014 to 2015 outbreak in West Africa. The determination is intended to mobilize an international response to combat mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has spread throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean and is suspected to be the cause of a sharp rise in birth defects in Brazil.The WHO reserves the PHEIC designation for ""extraordinary"" events that ""constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease"" such that they require ""a coordinated international response.""With the announcement, the WHO has said it will scale up its surveillance of Zika in countries battling the virus, and in other countries it may spread to next.WHO based their decision on the counsel of 11 members of an emergency committee on Zika virus as well as eight advisors. Specifically, the PHEIC is a call for the international community to figure out if these clusters of microcephaly and neurological abnormalities -- reported in babies in both French Polynesia and Brazil -- are related to Zika virus.""The PHEIC has to do with proving that these clusters are or are not related to Zika virus,"" said David L. Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and chair of the emergency committee.Additional emphasis will be placed on studying the virus' effects on ""fetuses, children and adults"" and controlling it via yet-to-be-developed vaccines and mosquito extermination efforts.Pregnant women are thought to be the most susceptible to Zika, a little-known virus that originated in Uganda in 1947 but was not linked to birth defects until 2015. While adults who contract Zika generally have mild symptoms like fever, rash, joint pain and headaches, officials believe it could pose a grave danger to a pregnant woman's fetus.In Brazil, a dramatic rise in microcephaly cases -- a condition where a baby's head and brain don't fully develop -- has been blamed on the rapidly spreading virus. While a causal link between Zika virus and microcephaly is yet to be established, it is strongly suspected, said WHO. ""All agree on the urgent need to coordinate international efforts to investigate and understand this relationship better,"" WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said. The expert committee examined the virus' recent spread; the broad distribution of Aedes aegypti mosquitos, which can transmit the virus; the lack of vaccines or diagnostic tests and the absence of immunity in newly affected countries. Together, these concerning factors weighed into their decision-making process, Chan explained.The committee decided that microcephaly clusters and associated neurological disorders constitute what Chan described as ""an extraordinary event and a public health threat to other parts of the world,"" and agreed that the situation met the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern.Still, Heymann, the emergency committee's chair, was careful to specify that the circumstances of Zika's spread, rather than just qualities of the virus itself, qualified it as a PHEIC.""Zika as we know it, as we understand it today, is not a clinically serious infection,"" he said. ""It's only because of this association, if it's proven, that Zika could be considered as a public health emergency of international concern.""Heymann said that it's not clear how long it will take to establish whether or not there is a causal link between Zika virus and microcephaly, but that the United States, Brazil and others were collaborating to begin studies, starting in the next two weeks. ""It's very complicated study and one that will take time,"" he said.Despite declaring a PHEIC, WHO's emergency Zika virus committee found no public health justification for restrictions on travel or trade to prevent the threat of Zika virus, Chan said -- only that certain populations like pregnant women should try to prevent mosquito bites. ""At present, the most important protective measures are the control of mosquito populations and the prevention of mosquito bites in at risk individuals, especially pregnant women,"" Chan said.After the 2014 to 2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, experts criticized WHO's slow response to the epidemic. The international health agency declared the Ebola outbreak an international public health emergency in August of 2014, only after 1,000 people had died. Internal documents reveal that they not only ignored months of warnings from officials with Doctors Without Borders, they also lagged after an April report from their own staff on the ground that the Ebola outbreak warranted the status of ""global emergency."" In the end, about 28,600 people contracted Ebola, and an estimated 11,300 people died. ","huffingtonpost","left","16832","zika",930
"The nation's governors urged Congress Monday to strike a deal on federal funding to combat the Zika virus, saying Washington must pony up the money before the country hits a ""tipping point"" and mosquitoes begin transmitting the virus in their states.""The nation is on the threshold of a public health emergency as it faces the likely spread of the Zika virus. As with all such emergencies, advance planning and preparation is essential to prevent injury and death,"" the National Governors Association, a bipartisan group that weighs in on national policy, said in a statement.Governors didn't say how much money is needed, but the White House said it took the statement as backing for President Obama's demand that Congress find $1.9 billion in new money.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Americans want the money spent so badly they're willing to tack it onto the record debt rather than cut other programs to pay for it.""This, obviously, is consistent with the argument that the administration has been making for more than two months now: that given the public health emergency that exists around the Zika virus, it's critical that Congress act quickly to provide the necessary funding to our public health professionals and to states to ensure we can protect the American people,"" Mr. Earnest said after the NGA statement.Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, plans to lobby on Capitol Hill this week for resources to deal with Zika since his state's climate makes it vulnerable to the virus' main vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito.In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has begun distributing larvicide tablets and deploying mosquito traps to gird for Zika, while Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland held a ""Zika Virus Awareness Week"" last month.Darrell West, director of governance studies at The Brookings Institution, said the push reflects a belief that responding to Zika will cost more down the road if lawmakers don't forge a plan now.""Governors around the country understand this and want Congress to act. This is not a time to be penny-wise and pound-foolish,"" he said.Republican leaders, however, say they are leery of cutting the administration a ""blank check"" to fight Zika.They say Mr. Obama has already shifted more than $500 million from anti-Ebola efforts in West Africa to the Zika fight, buying time for all sides to work out a bigger agreement as part of the annual spending process this fall.Senate Republicans have spoken with Democrats about trying to find $1.1 billion now, but those talks appeared to stall before senators skipped town for a week.The Centers for Disease Control has recorded 426 Zika cases in the states and the District, most of them contracted by travelers overseas, with a handful contracted by sexual contact with an infected person.But experts fear the virus will begin to spread by mosquito once temperatures rise and the bug population flourishes.The virus is already circulating on its own in Puerto Rico, where it's infected more than 600 people and led to one man's death.Governors urged Congress to move swiftly on some kind of deal, saying they will need more resources to combat the virus once mosquito season kicks into high gear.""As Congress returns from recess today, the nation's governors urge the administration and Congress to work together to reach agreement on the appropriate funding levels needed to prepare for and combat the Zika virus,"" the association said. ""We also ask they act as expeditiously as possible to ensure those funds are available to states, territories and the public at large.""Democrats want to treat Zika funding as emergency spending that is tacked onto the deficit - akin to relief funding after hurricanes or other disasters.House conservatives and outside groups like Heritage Action have pushed back though, saying any new spending to fight Zika must be offset by budget cuts elsewhere. ","washingtontimes","right","16930","zika",653
"Sen. John Thune, vultureWhat's the best way to prevent more babies being born with horrible deformities from the Zika virus? Preventing the pregnancy in exposed women in the first place. That means allowing Planned Parenthood, which helps prevent approximately 579,000 unintended pregnancies every year, to keep doing that job. But it's Planned Parenthood and it's an election year, so Republicans are specifically banning Zika prevention funding from being spent at Planned Parenthood. Because of that, Senate Democrats are not playing along.Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid (Nev.), standing at a press conference alongside Planned Parenthood vice president Dawn Laguens, said women often have ""no place else to go.""""So on that issue alone, I think it's pretty strong,"" Reid added, speaking of his justification for blocking the bill. Republicans, though, are accusing Democrats of opposing the Zika funding bill simply to protect a ""special interest.""""Special interests got to them, special interest groups snapped their fingers and the Democrats came running,"" Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the Senate's No. 3 Republican, told reporters. ""And as a consequence, there is not going to be funding for Zika.""Planned Parenthood is not a ""special interest."" It's a first-tier health care provider for millions of men and women, and in particular low-income women. Which makes it a first-line defender in a disease like this one. We've seen all the arguments before in the Republicans' jihad against Planned Parenthood-if the federal funds don't go to it, they'll just go to other providers, like community health clinics. And we'll see community health clinics, again, say that they aren't going to have the capacity to take on an influx of new patients. This means, as usual, there's one population that Republicans are punishing.","dailykos","left","16987","zika",289
"A Jamaican Olympic gold medalist has announced that he is carrying the Zika virus, but will continue to train and hopes to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics this August in Rio de Janiero, Brazil.Kemar Bailey-Cole says he is currently suffering from rashes and mild joint pain, the tell-tale symptoms of the viral disease, but continues to train and expects to perform in Rio. ""I am a little worried but I am not letting that get in front of me. I am just praying that I get the strength to carry me through the rounds,"" he said in an interview with Jamaican newspaper Gleaner.""Recovering is not easy because as we speak, the rashes are still on my body. My eyes hurt, but the best thing is that I am not feeling any muscle pain at the moment,"" he added. He noted, however, that the muscle pain was mild enough that he dismissed it as exercise soreness before getting a haircut, revealing a lump on his neck.""It is very disappointing but as I said earlier, I was training with it and didn't know, so I still got in some work but not how I wanted it (I am) just going to trials with the mindset that I am healthy and ready,"" he concluded.Bailey-Cole is the first athlete known to be training to compete while carrying Zika. South America and the Caribbean are currently in the throes of a Zika epidemic that has affected tens of thousands, with its epicenter in Brazil. Bailey-Cole appears to have contracted Zika in Jamaica, however, which has documented numerous Zika cases. Jamaican doctors sounded the alarm in February, lamenting a lack of concern among the general population and releasing a dancehall reggae song to promote awareness.Bailey-Cole has also suffered from Chikunyunga, a disease also transmitted through the aedes aegypti virus. In addition to Zika and Chikunyunga, the mosquito can carry Dengue fever and yellow fever.Most Zika patients - about 80 percent - do not experience any symptoms. Those who do experience mild joint pain, conjunctivitis, and rashes. While Zika causes mild symptoms in adults, it can have devastating consequences when present in the bloodstream of a pregnant woman. Zika has been known to cause a number of birth defects in newborns, most commonly microcephaly, a condition in which infants are born with brains too large for their skulls, crushing vital parts of the brain.","breitbart","right","16979","zika",407
"The government of Venezuela has confirmed three deaths directly related to the Zika pandemic sweeping Latin America, while medical experts throughout the country report an alarming rise in the number of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a disease Zika is suspected of triggering in certain patients.""We have 319 confirmed cases [of Zika], of which 68 have gotten complicated and, unfortunately, we have had three Zika-related deaths nationally,"" socialist President Nicolás Maduro announced Thursday. He noted that, given how time-consuming the effort of confirming the presence of Zika in a patient's bloodstream is, the government has only been able to confirm those 319 cases, but doctors are monitoring 5,221 suspected cases of Zika nationwide as of February 8.The number is about 500 more cases than the last official estimate out of the South American country. On January 28, Minister of Health Luisana Melo announced that the country's doctors were monitoring 4,700 suspected cases of Zika. The government had not released new figures since, until this week.In a related health crisis, doctors are reporting an escalating number of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a disease in which the body's immune system begins attacking its nerves. The result is crippling muscular pain and, in many cases, paralysis and death. Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional reports that doctors have documented 21 deaths related to Guillain-Barré. Doctors in both Brazil-the country that has become host to most of the Zika cases in this outbreak-and Colombia have also documented an increase in the number of Guillain-Barré cases and have begun to suspect that the Zika virus can trigger this immune system reaction when infecting patients.El Nacional does not attribute the Guillain-Barré deaths to Zika specifically, however, but to Venezuela's extreme shortage of pharmaceutical products, which prompted the head of the nation's Pharmaceutical Federation to declare a ""humanitarian emergency"" in January. Doctors treat Guillain-Barré primarily with two alternative treatments: injections of immunoglobulin or albumin, products derived from healthy blood. ""The lack of immunoglobulin and albumin has taken the lives of 21 people in 6 weeks,"" El Nacional writes. Three have died in Caracas; the third died when the syndrome paralyzed the muscles surrounding the lungs, making it impossible to breathe.""Most of these patients had symptoms similar to Zika in the days prior to having Guillain-Barré,"" the newspaper notes.El Universal, another Venezuela newspaper, reports that Guillain-Barré has become a problem outside the capital, as well. In Mérida state, local authorities are tracking 158 suspected cases of Zika, six with Guillain-Barré. They have insisted, however, ""The Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya situation is under control in our state."" The Aedes aegypti mosquito, of which Venezuela has a significant population, spreads all three diseases.At least one NGO is suggesting that the Venezuelan government numbers are significantly smaller than the actual number of Guillain-Barré cases. José Félix Oletta, a former Venezuelan health minister who works with the Let's Defend Epidemiology Network, claims the group has evidence that there may be more than 3,000 Guillain-Barré patients in Venezuela. ""We already have a weakened health care system, which tends to make these problems spread more rapidly. Add to that the lack of information and it's a perfect storm,"" Oletta said in January.In addition to those inside Venezuela, the government of Colombia has alleged that the Venezuelan socialist government has ""no systematic reporting of the data"" regarding Zika cases, which is a ""serious problem,"" according to Colombian Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria. Colombia has recorded over 30,000 cases of Zika, compared to Venezuela's suspected 5,000, a number indicating that Venezuela is underreporting its cases, given that the countries share a border.","breitbart","right","16843","zika",602
"As Latin America's Zika outbreak continues to spread, the United States is moving to reject blood donations from individuals traveling to countries affected by the Zika virus, while the Canadian government considers similar action.Spokeswoman Tara Goodin told the media the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies are working ""to rapidly implement appropriate donor deferral measures for travelers who have visited affected regions in order to protect the blood supply in the United States.""She did not specify when the FDA would take action.The Pan-American regional wing of the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the disease could spread to nations with the mosquito carriers. They exempt Chile and Canada, since those countries are not home to the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the carrier of the virus.Despite the minimized threat, Canadian officials are not ""ruling out changes to it blood-donation policy.""""We are carefully monitoring the zika virus issue and are considering revisions to our travel deferral policies in order to protect the Canadian blood supply from the threat of this virus,"" explained Dr. Dana Devine, Chief Medical and Scientific Officer for Canadian Blood Services.The Public Health Agency of Canada urged pregnant women to consult with their doctors before traveling to affected regions, following America's example. Brazil, El Salvador, and Colombia have advised women from getting pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.Patients often experience mild symptoms with Zika, but pregnant women face a larger danger. Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which causes a baby to be born with a skull too small for their brains. This leads to serious mental disabilities.Officials preparing for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janiero are now taking into account Zika prevention measures for both athletes and tourists. Brazilian authorities ordered health workers to sterilize the Sambadrome, which will serve as the center for the Olympics.More than 3,000 health workers in yellow suits, goggles, and gloves sprayed down the massive structure to fight against the disease.""We are losing the battle in a big way,"" admitted health minister Marcelo Castro.The Australian Olympic Committee pushed their female athletes to educate themselves about Zika and ""consider the risks of competing in the Rio Olympics due to the outbreak of Zika.""""Any team members who are pregnant at the time of the Games need to consider the risks very carefully before deciding whether to proceed with travel to Brazil,"" they said.Athletes will receive mosquito repellent from officials, who also recommend everyone wear long sleeves when possible.""The health and wellbeing of all our team members is paramount, especially those females in the team of child bearing age,"" declared Australian Olympic Team Chef de Mission Kitty Chillier.

"The White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) plan to meet with officials in individual states to combat against the mosquito that carries the Zika virus.""The best-case scenario here is that we could either limit local transmission or get ahead of it and contain it as soon as possible,"" explained Amy Pope, deputy assistant for Homeland Security.The CDC believes the U.S. will record its first mosquito-transmitted case of Zika by June or July. Doctors have already confirmed cases in people who traveled to Zika areas and sexually transmitted Zika.The meeting will take place on April 1 at the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta, GA. The White House invited ""officials involved in mosquito control and public health.""""We've had surprises,"" said CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat. ""We're in a posture of knowing that time is precious and collaboration is essential.""On February 22, President Barack Obama asked Congress to include $1.9 billion in the FY 2016 emergency supplemental appropriations to fight against Zika. From the White House:Puerto Rico has confirmed over 100 cases. The CDC expects thousands of cases this year.""We are extremely concerned about Puerto Rico,"" she added.Florida has confirmed 42 cases of Zika, including four pregnant women. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency over the Zika outbreak in Latin America last month. He has ""requested 250 additional Zika antibody tests from the CDC"" after he learned about the cases of pregnant women with Zika. The tests allow people ""to see if they ever had the Zika virus."" The majority of people who contract Zika do not experience any symptoms.Zika poses more risks to pregnant women since scientists believe a link exists between Zika and microcephaly, a rare birth defect that occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth, causing small heads. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced that doctors had confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly.""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC Director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of claiming Zika caused the microcephaly cases. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.Last week, the CDC announced it is investigating fourteen cases of sexually transmitted Zika in the United States. The Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) confirmed the first sexually transmitted Zika case in the beginning of February. The CDC responded with an advisory for people to take precautions to prevent transmission of the virus. This latest discovery forced the center to issue another Health Advisory Notice (HAN) ""to underscore the importance of adhering to the interim guidance published on February 5."" These include pregnant women asking their male partners about possible Zika contact. They also asked everyone to use condoms until further notice since no one knows for sure how long Zika survives in sperm.","breitbart","right","16864","zika",524

"Aggressive tropical mosquitos-a breed that can carry the Zika virus-are ""infesting"" Orange County, California, authorities warn.The invasive species-which can also carry yellow fever, dengue fever and chinungunya-could pose a risk to the public.None of the mosquitoes in question has yet been found to be carrying Zika, but could provide a vector for its transmission. Authorities recently admitted that there have been six Zika cases in the last three years in California, and that the mosquitos responsible for Zika have been found in 12 of the 58 counties in California.Aedes aegypti, or yellow fever mosquitos, were reported in Orange County last October. The Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District (OCMVCD) stated at the time that the mosquitos had been found in Anaheim earlier in the year, but had not been seen since an area resident's April 2015 report.""The Yellow Fever mosquito is a small but aggressive day-biting species,"" the OCMVCD wrote, in a flyer urging the public's assistance. ""The Yellow Fever mosquito breeds in small containers, particularly the types of container found in residential yards. We are asking you to call Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District at (714) 971-2421 if you are bitten during the day by a mosquito.""Rober Cummings with the OCMVCD told Fox 11 local news in an interview that the yellow fever mosquito looks different than local Orange County mosquitos, which tend to be brown.

""it is generally accepted that the transportation of dormant eggs attached to items such as imported tires and plants, is commonly associated with introductions of this mosquito species.""It remains unconfirmed whether the rapidly spreading Zika virus actually causes birth defect microcephaly, but the World Health Organization (WHO) this week declared a global emergency over the virus.

"Congress should ""do its job"" and take up President Obama's request for nearly $2 billion to combat the Zika virus, the White House said in its most urgent plea to date for emergency funds to defend pregnant women against the mosquito-borne disease linked to serious birth defects.Congressional Republicans told Mr. Obama to spend leftover Ebola funds instead of seeking a cash infusion to fight the Zika virus, which is circulating through Latin America, including Puerto Rico, and could puncture the U.S. mainland in the coming months.Speaking at Friday's Zika Action Summit, a White House official said Congress is asking Americans to choose which disease they would like to be protected against. ""That just doesn't make a lot of sense,"" Amy Pope, deputy homeland security adviser, told reporters at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.Administration officials say they are relying on private donations and rummaging through the couch cushions for extra cash to fight Zika.House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Harold Rogers says the administration hasn't spent about $2.7 billion of the $5.3 billion set aside to deal with the Ebola outbreak, and that Congress could backfill the use of those funds during the fiscal 2017 appropriations process.Ms. Pope said even if they repurpose some of the leftover Ebola funding, ""the money we have now is not enough.""""Congress needs to act and do its job,"" she said.Zika has been linked to a marked uptick in the number of babies born with abnormally small heads, a condition known as microcephaly, in Brazil and other Latin American countries. It also has been tied to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis.Though Zika isn't spreading locally in the continental U.S., the CDC has recorded 312 travel-related cases in the 50 states and the District, including 27 cases in pregnant women.U.S. territories have reported 349 cases of locally acquired infection, mostly in Puerto Rico.As that virus looms, the White House says it will not shortchange efforts to fully stamp out Ebola, which has killed more than 11,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea since December 2013.On Friday the World Health Organization said a 30-year-old Liberian women died from Ebola on Thursday, just days after the agency said the outbreak was no longer a public health emergency of international concern.Neighboring Guinea is investigating a cluster of new cases in one of its southern regions.""Ebola is not over,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden said, citing the flare-ups.The WHO says the brunt of the Ebola outbreak is finished, however, and the latest data suggest transmission of Zika has peaked in countries such as Colombia and could slow down.Dr. Frieden said it is common for viruses to slow down and speed up from country to country or from town to town. ""It's very difficult to predict what the pattern will be,"" he said.The Obama administration assembled its Zika summit Friday to get federal, state and local officials to coordinate plans for educating the public and eradicating the pesky Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the disease - efforts that will ramp up as U.S. temperatures rise and more mosquitoes circulate in the continental U.S.In the meantime, the CDC is urging pregnant women not to travel to Zika-affected nations. Men who return from those areas should use condoms, the agency says, because Zika can be sexually transmitted. The CDC says pregnant women who live in Puerto Rico or other territories where Zika is actively spreading should use insect repellent and wear long sleeves. ","washingtontimes","right","16892","zika",584

"The Zika virus is primarily spread by mosquito bites, but emerging research on the sexual transmission of the virus suggests it's a lot more common than previously thought. And it doesn't have to be vaginal sex that transmits the disease.In an op-ed published in the New England Journal of Medicine Thursday, doctors described their theory that a man traveling from Rio de Janeiro may have spread the virus to his partner through oral sex.The 46-year-old man had suffered from fever, a rash and muscle pain on Feb. 7 while he was in Brazil, but the symptoms had disappeared by the time he arrived in France on Feb. 10. He then had unprotected sex seven times with his partner between Feb. 11 and 20, engaging in both vaginal and oral sex. However, his partner only had contact with his semen during oral sex, the doctors noted.By Feb. 20, the 24-year-old partner, who had been living in Paris and had not traveled to a region with active Zika transmission, began to experience the same symptoms the man had experienced in Brazil. Her symptoms lasted for one week.Both patients ended up testing positive for Zika virus. The woman had traces of the virus in her saliva and urine, but not in her vaginal fluid or blood. The man tested positive for the virus in his urine and semen, but not in his saliva or blood.The medical results suggest that the man passed Zika virus to his partner via oral sex, although the researchers concede that they can't rule out transmission via pre-ejaculate fluid during vaginal sex or saliva during ""deep kissing.""Scientists have known since 2011 that Zika virus might be spread sexually. A researcher who got the disease in Senegal went back home to Colorado, where he had unprotected sex with his wife and then passed the disease on to her. This initial case was later confirmed during the current Zika virus epidemic in Latin America after several transmissions in which travelers passed the virus to partners after returning home to countries without endemic Zika spread.Ten countries have reported local Zika virus transmission even though their local mosquito populations don't carry the disease, reported The New York Times -- an indication of sexual transmission. In the U.S., there have been 11 cases of sexually-transmitted Zika virus since the current epidemic started.Because of this, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that men traveling in Zika-endemic countries use condoms for oral, vaginal or anal sex with their partners once they return home. This advice is especially urgent for couples who are pregnant, as a sexually-transmitted Zika virus presents extraordinary risk to the developing fetus, including miscarriage, stillbirth and microcephaly. ","huffingtonpost","left","16955","zika",476
"GOP Rep.

The mosquito-borne virus can cause crippling birth defects and, in adults, has been linked to the neurological disorder Guillain-Barre.Last week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that the Games did not need to be moved or postponed because there is ""a very low risk"" that holding the event in Brazil will cause further spread of the virus.An expert WHO panel on Zika concluded that staging the event during the Brazilian winter means the mosquito population will be smaller and intensified mosquito-control measures in place around venues ""should further reduce the risk of transmission"".Medical experts had a mixed response to McIlroy's decision.Derek Gatherer, a virus expert at Britain's Lancaster University, said if the golfer was ""contemplating becoming a father within a year or so, then it was a perfectly reasonable precaution to stay away from regions of active Zika transmission"".But Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said: ""Obviously I don't know the reasons for this decision, but it does strike me as being extreme.""The chances of being infected by the Zika virus is low, especially if you protect yourself from mosquito bites by covering up and using a good insect repellent.""But there are clearly worries in the golf world. Earlier this month, world number one Jason Day expressed doubts for the first time over whether he would compete and the virus was a hot topic of conversation among golfers at last week's U.S. Open.Masters champion Danny Willett, whose wife Nicole gave birth to their first child at the end of March, said he was excited about the Olympic Games but would not to go if his family's health was at risk.The list of Rio absentees also includes Australian world number eight Adam Scott and South Africa's world number 14 Louis Oosthuizen, who both opted out over scheduling conflicts.The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last year in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,400 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in mothers.Britain's Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford has decided to have his sperm frozen before the Games.His partner Susie Verrill, who will not travel to Rio with their young son, said the couple had taken the precaution because they wanted to have more children.McIlroy, who is engaged to American Erica Stoll, took a long time to decide who he would represent in Rio and threatened to skip the Olympics as he agonized over his choice between Britain and Ireland before opting for the latter in 2014.""I trust the Irish people will understand my decision (not to go,"" McIlroy added. ""I will continue to endeavor to make my fans and fans of golf proud with my play on the course and my actions off it.""Irish golf team captain Paul McGinley said McIlroy would have been a 100 percent certain pick for the Games but fully understood the reasoning behind the player's withdrawal.""It's not for me to influence his decision, it's a health decision he has discussed with his family and wife to be,"" McGinley told Irish national broadcaster RTE.""Shane (Lowry) and GMac (Graeme McDowell) are the next two in at the moment.""In a statement the IGF said: ""(We) are disappointed with Rory's decision but recognize that some players will have to weigh personally a unique set of circumstances as they contemplate their participation in golf's historic return to the Olympic Games in Rio, with the Zika virus foremost among them.""(Additional reporting by Kate Kelland and Martyn Herman,; Editing by John O'Brien and Ken Ferris)","huffingtonpost","left","16974","zika",816
"As more cases of Zika virus pop up in the U.S., abortion rights advocates are raising concerns about whether harsh abortion restrictions will affect pregnant women's ability to terminate pregnancies if they're infected with the virus.Zika has been linked to microcephaly, in which babies are born with underdeveloped brains and abnormally small heads. Some cases seen in Brazil and elsewhere in the Americas have been severe. As The Huffington Post reported last week, people born with microcephaly ""may suffer from additional ailments, including convulsions, impaired vision and hearing, deformed limbs and severe breathing problems.""In El Salvador, where abortion is completely outlawed, the government has advised women to simply not get pregnant until 2018. In Brazil and other Latin American countries, the outbreak has officials re-examining strict abortion laws. Here in the U.S., officials have stayed mum on the topic, but abortion rights advocates are rightly wondering what an increase in fetal abnormalities would mean at a time where abortion restrictions -- from lengthy waiting periods to laws designed to shutter clinics -- have left millions of American women without access to abortion care.But if what the WHO calls an ""explosion"" of Zika does indeed lead to an uptick in fetal abnormalities in the U.S., the abortion rights movement faces another problem: a coming clash with the disability rights movement.While abortion rights advocates might well point to Zika-linked microcephaly as evidence that the U.S. needs to liberalize abortion laws, disability rights advocates might argue otherwise. On the issue of abortion, the feminist and disability rights movement often come into uncomfortable conflict as they struggle to accommodate both the rights of a woman to control her own fertility and the rights of people with disabilities to exist.Now, with the threat of Zika-linked fetal abnormalities looming, that fault line could well crack open, and at least one thought leader in disability rights is concerned by the hastiness with which calls for loosened abortion restrictions are being made.There are clear parallels between the experiences of women and those of people with disabilities (not to mention overlaps between the two groups), noted Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, a professor of English at Emory University and a pioneer of the discipline of disability studies. Through much of history, she said, able-bodied women were not allowed to control their own reproduction.""There's a long, deep and troubling history of women's reproduction being taken over by men and by a variety of other cultural institutions,"" she told HuffPost. Likewise, people with disabilities have long been subject to reproductive coercion, from the abandonment of newborns with disabilities to mandatory sterilization of women with disabilities. They have, said Garland-Thomson, ""been eugenically eliminated from the world through selective abortion and other biomedical practices.""Both groups have similar histories of subjugation, particularly around medical decision-making. And on the issue of access to abortion, particularly in the age of prenatal fetal testing, those histories collide.It's important to note that the causal connection between Zika and microcephaly has not been clearly established. In Colombia, for example, many cases of Zika have been reported, with no corresponding increase in microcephaly. ""I think everyone is concerned about that and with good reason, but we don't know that 100 percent for sure yet. It's not completely established,"" said Dr. Anne Davis, a practicing OB-GYN and an associate professor of Clinical Obstetrics at Columbia University.And, though this week saw the first U.S. case of sexually transmitted Zika, most reproductive rights organizations are calling for a measured response, while the CDC is warning pregnant women to postpone travel to areas affected by Zika.Complicating the abortion issue is the fact that microcephaly in a fetus cannot be detected until well into the second trimester of a pregnancy. ""Late in the first trimester you can see the complete absence of the brain, anencephaly, but not microcephaly,"" says Davis, who is also an abortion provider who performs second-trimester abortions.This presents a problem if microcephaly cases spike in the U.S. One percent of abortions performed in the U.S. happen in the second trimester and when they do, they usually happen because of a threat to the life of the mother or due to fetal abnormalities.Abortion at this point in a pregnancy is rare and hard to come by. It's expensive -- often well over $1,000 -- and that's before you factor in the cost of traveling and accommodation to see the few providers who perform the procedure, skipping days of work for travel and recovery (and waiting periods in between appointments, which some states require), securing childcare for any kids you might already have, and so on. ""Once you detect [a fetal abnormality], it's not like you have an ultrasound and right that second they say 'OK, if it's the right choice for you, you can have your abortion,'"" Davis says. The longer a woman waits -- to make her choice, or to raise the money to exercise it -- the more expensive the procedure becomes.Pregnant women who choose to have an abortion when microcephaly shows up in fetal testing have an enormously difficult decision to make, Davis said. She does her best to explain to expecting families what they can expect their child's life to be like. ""It depends on the severity of the microcephaly,"" she said. ""There's a range, and you do have some information about that from ultrasounds. We can guide families about the severity of what we see. And that's where the real conversation occurs, doctor to family, doctor to woman. You can give people some guidance, it's not just a diagnosis and then you say 'well we'll see what happens.'""Still, it's not an easy decision, as reproductive rights advocates acknowledge, and considering a potential child's quality of life is central to it. ""What we argue for is empowered, informed decision-making,"" says Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. ""Women make decisions for all sorts of reasons, and no one walks in their shoes but them. At the end of the day, we could litigate every individual case, but that undercuts the core value that's at stake, which is that we live in a country that prizes autonomy and information.""Embedded in the calls for re-examining abortion policies as Zika looms is the assumption that aborting a fetus with microcephaly is ethical and that women will want and should have the right to ability-selective abortions. There's little room, in the usual pro-choice argument, for the notion that that disabled child has the right to exist, or for questioning the notion that life with a disability is inherently worse than life without one. That having a child with a disability is undesirable is usually taken as a given, not just by pro-choice advocates, but by much of U.S. society.Disability rights advocates argue otherwise. ""Somehow, what got written into the idea of reproductive choice and freedom and self determination for women is the assumption that no woman is prepared or would want to parent a child with a disability,"" Garland-Thomson said.She acknowledges that there are very real challenges involved in parenting a child with disabilities. Raising special needs children can be enormously resource-intensive, and is often done with limited government or other structural support. The same states that are narrowing abortion access ""also offer almost no support for women who need quality care for special needs children,"" Hogue observed.Nicole Cliffe, editor of The Toast and the mother of a special needs child, expressed her frustration this week in a series of tweets. ""We fail so terribly not just at providing disability resources, but for providing parents (esp[ecially] ESL parents) with the info to ACCESS them,"" she wrote. ""My child needs such minor support and I do not know how people without money and/or education navigate the paperwork and services and hoops.""""It's days off work, it's out-of-pocket therapies until diagnoses kick in, it's fighting your insurance, it's becoming a full-time advocate,"" she continued. ""A kid with disabilities born into poverty should be able to receive adequate support and care, and we just do not provide that.""How is it just, abortion rights advocates rightly ask, that the government force women to bring children with disabilities into the world under these circumstances? Garland-Thomson isn't unsympathetic to this argument, but she notes that it wouldn't hold water were we to substitute race of gender for disability.She blames the lack of public knowledge about the lives of people with disabilities for the widespread belief that ability-selective abortions are normal, desirable and ethical.""Reproductive self-determination is understood as a kind of carte blanche for women to exercise basically a kind of set of discriminatory attitudes and practices,"" she said.To allow reproductive justice and disability justice to coexist more harmoniously, Garland-Thomson doesn't advocate restricting reproductive rights any further than they've been curtailed. ""I think what we have to do is rescript the story: the story of disability is almost always a grim one, particularly in terms of prognosis,"" she says. The solution, she argues, is to expand reproductive choices, ""but we expand them in a deliberative way. I don't think we should have a no-questions-asked abortion policy -- we should have a lot of questions asked after viability."" The decision to terminate a pregnancy, she said, ""should be a very deliberative process where there is full consideration of all the possible vectors of consideration for women, rather than just ""holy shit, I don't want to have a disabled kid.'""It's hard to imagine, in the current political climate, how American states might enact policies to genuinely encourage that deliberative process. Disguising hurdles to abortion access as a way of ensuring that women carefully consider their choices -- making them look at the ultrasound image, explaining to them what the fetus looks like -- is a favored tactic of the anti-abortion movement. The result, as Davis says, is that ""abortion access has been shrunken down to the size of a postage stamp."" Garland-Thomson is calling for a genuine, non-coercive version of that process, but in the U.S. in 2016, it's hard to imagine how to protect it from anti-abortion hijacking. She also calls for new policies and systems that will allow all parents, regardless of means and the abilities of their children to flourish.While that sounds intensely desirable -- as a long-term societal project -- it doesn't suggest an answer to the fiercely urgent question: what do we do now? What do we do if a few months from now, when mosquito season arrives, hundreds or thousands of low-income women in Texas and Florida find themselves pregnant with fetuses that show severe brain damage? What does ethical behavior look like in the here and now, in this political reality?As is often the case when it comes to abortion, the stakes are high -- and there are no easy answers.","huffingtonpost","left","16835","zika",1854
"With the advent of synthetic biology and gene editing tools, there are amazing breakthroughs being made in medicine, energy and food. Within a few years, we will see cures for debilitating diseases, new biofuels, and grains that can be grown in extreme climates. We will also have many new nightmares: bioterrorism and well-meaning experiments that get out of hand. Imagine a superbug that can cure -- or kill -- millions of people or a virus which targets one person, say, a U.S. president. This is not science fiction; it is happening.In 2011 a scientist, Craig Venter, created a new life form by transplanting a computer-designed genome into the cell of a bacterium that had had its DNA removed. Today, a gene-editing technique called CRISPR is being used to engineer extra-muscular beagles, micro-pigs, super-goats, and ever-white mushrooms. Chinese researchers have edited human embryos. The cost of doing basic synthetic biology experiments is only a few thousand dollars, for lab gear and chemicals, and it is possible to design and order up DNA sequences on the Internet.We are not ready for the consequences of these technologies. We need to urgently develop new bio-defenses, rethink our laws, and bring together researchers from all over the world to solve the problems as soon as they occur.We can start by forming a global coalition to attack the Zika virus.Zika is propagated by mosquitoes and causes birth defects in infected mothers. It is likely to spread worldwide within the next year. The solution may lie in open-sourcing information -- as leading researchers have recommended.In February, a high-powered group of health organizations including research institutes, academic journals, NGOs, and funding bodies published a public commitment to ""sharing data and results relevant to the current Zika crisis and future public health emergencies as rapidly and openly as possible."" Signatories included journals Nature and Science, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. National Institute of Health.Said Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust in the statement, ""Research is an essential part of the response to any global health emergency. This is particularly true for Zika, where so much is still unknown about the virus, how it is spread and the possible link with microcephaly. It's critical that as results become available they are shared rapidly in a way that is equitable, ethical and transparent. This will ensure that the knowledge gained is turned quickly into health interventions that can have an impact on the epidemic.""Open science has been a topic of debate for over a decade. A growing number of vocal researchers have advocated that all research funded with public funds is open sourced, and not just the articles but the actual research data sets. The logic follows similar logic to open source software. When more eyes can look at data, it is less likely the data will contain errors -- and solutions can be developed jointly. Just as in software, scientists anticipate that by open sourcing more medical data, they will enable more breakthroughs by increasing the body of pre-vetted knowledge and reducing the redundancy in research efforts.This type of information sharing did not happen effectively with last major epidemic that sparked global concern, the Ebola virus. When Ebola was raging through West Africa in the summer of 2014, a group at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass. published open repository sequence data for 99 Ebola genomes taken from patients in Sierra Leone's Kenema government hospital. This open sourcing of critical scientific data was the second instance in the outbreak. A team of international researchers had initially published three genomes from patients in Guinea in April.For the next three months, no more genomic data was released to the public data repositories that had become the go-to source for scientists studying Ebola. The silence puzzled many prominent scientists. A formidable array of genomic sequencing technology was aimed squarely at the virus. Yet the data was not shared.This delayed progress and troubled three of the most prominent Ebola researchers, Nathan Yozwiak, Stephen Schaffner and Pardis Sabeti. They published a plea for data sharing in the leading scientific journal Nature, titled ""Make outbreak research open access.""Sharing data among researchers has long been a thorny topic. In the cutthroat competition to place articles in top scientific journals -- the key currency in academic circles -- researchers have traditionally held data close to the vest so as not to jeopardize the exclusivity of their findings and, by extension, article acceptance. Conversely, for pandemics such as Ebola and influenza, security experts have feared that publishing genomic data would allow evil scientists or regimes to stand on the shoulders of upstanding researchers and use publicly published genomics data to create equally or even more lethal pathogens that can kill millions.A decade ago, when sequencing genomes was incredibly expensive, tedious, and hard, some of the arguments for holding data closed did make sense. This provided a viable moat against rogue states and organizations. But today, the cost of DNA sequencing and synthetic biology experimentation has dropped to the point that anyone can do it; the bad guys already have the resources to unleash bioterrorism.The good news is that there are far more people in the world who want to do good than bad. We need to bring together the hundreds of thousands of scientists who want to use technology to better the world and solve critical problems. The best way is to create communities and begin crowdsourcing critical research.","huffingtonpost","left","16913","zika",938
"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has decided not to postpone the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro despite the widespread presence of Zika virus in host nation Brazil.""Our priority is to protect the health of the athletes,"" stated Dr. Richard Budgett, medical director of IOC. ""The IOC absolutely is not complacent. We do take this very seriously. Everything is being done to contain and reduce this problem in the lead-up to the games.""U.S. Olympics officials hired experts on infectious diseases to advise the committee on the Zika virus. The committee told athletes they will address their fears and stay up-to-date on the situation.Despite the name, the Summer Olympics will take place during winter in Brazil, so officials hope the cooler weather will kill the Aedes aegypti mosquito known to spread Zika and diminish the threat. Spring formally begins in September.""Everything that can be done is being done,"" continued Budgett. ""We can give the reassurance that authorities in Brazil are taking it extremely seriously.""He added: ""Concern and worry is appropriate, but there is no restriction on travel. People need to take measures to avoid being bitten and be sensible. There is no recommendation from health authorities to change travel plans.""Budgett also said the CDC or World Health Organizations have not pressured the committee to postpone the Olympics.""Our main job is to calm down everybody,"" said Rio organizing committee spokesperson Mario Andrada. ""The panic is starting [to be] a little too much. We are looking for true facts to make sure we don't generate any unnecessary worries.""While the world concentrates on Zika, an Australian doctor with the Olympic team believes the Rio water poses more of a threat towards the athletes than the Zika virus.Tests found ""disease-causing viruses"" in the Guanabara Bay and aquatic venues, including sailing, rowing, canoeing, open-water swimming, and triathlon.""If someone gets a nasty gastro infection, vomiting and diarrhea, it's not ideal for competing in an Olympic environment,"" explained Dr. David Hughes. ""Rio poses a multitude of medical challenges when it comes to keeping our athletes and officials safe. We have had many teams go to Rio, we are aware of the water quality issues. We have protocols in place to minimize the risk, but you can't make the risk zero.""Olympic Spanish swimmer Mireia Belmonte might not attend the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janiero due to the Zika outbreak.""If my health is in danger, I will think about not going to the Rio games,"" she said.U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo said the Zika virus could keep out of the Summer Olympics as well.""If I had to make the choice today, I wouldn't go,"" she declared to Sports Illustrated.Stadiums in Manaus, Salvador, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, and Sáo Paulo will host the Olympic soccer games instead of those in Rio de Janeiro. They hosted games during the 2014 World Cup.But those areas ""have higher rates than Rio of mosquito-borne viruses like Zika, dengue, chikungunya and malaria."" The Brazilian government has advised women to delay pregnancy for up to two years due to the possible connection to microcephaly, a rare birth defect that occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy.Two sources told Reuters that the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) recommended any athlete or trainer concerned about the Zika outbreak should consider not attending the Olympics.Brazil promised to fumigate and sterilize Olympic stadiums leading up to the games. The health workers plan to follow the same procedures every day during the Olympics.Dr. Arthur Caplan of the NYU Langone Medical Center told Breitbart News Daily the Olympic committee should delay the games for at least six months.""You've got this outbreak going on, and you're going to expose hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, who go down there to attend the Olympics or participate in them,"" he stated. ""We don't have a cure, we don't have a vaccine, there is now a couple of cases that have been reported about transmission of the virus into the blood supply, we don't have a good test for that why would we be trying to run an Olympics in a country that is straining, anyway?""","breitbart","right","16843","zika",714
"The Brazilian Conference of Catholic Bishops has rejected the left's attempt to promote abortion in areas affected by Zika.The bishops acknowledge the ""virus deserves special attention by its probable link to microcephaly,"" but insist it is unacceptable to immediately jump to abortion.""The alert, however, should not panic us,"" they wrote. ""Nor use it to justify abortion for cases of microcephaly as proposed regrettably by certain groups that organize to take the matter to the Supreme Court, a total disrespect for the gift of life.""Planned Parenthood and leftist politicians have argued that easier access to abortion will help contain the damage the Zika virus is causing in Latin America.""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,"" wrote sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy in O Globo.Virologist Gubio Soares, who first identified the presence of the pervasive Zika virus in Brazil, suggested that legalized abortion in French Polynesia may have prevented scientists from uncovering a link between Zika and severe infant deformities sooner.During a lecture, Soares claimed scientists do not know for sure if a link exists between Zika and microcephaly. This is mainly because women in places where Zika breeds often abort children who show signs of microcephaly, a disorder now linked to the virus. Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth, causing a small skull. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.Fear of microcephaly or other complications due to Zika has pushed women to choose illegal abortions. Doctors indicate women in all social classes are seeking out these abortions ""in despair over the possibility of deformity."" Some even go through with abortions without concrete proof of complications.Doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester or after birth:""Health is a right that must be guaranteed. Without a comprehensive and effective national health policy, all efforts to fight the disease will be compromised,"" said the bishops.Brazil has outlawed abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is in danger, and a judge must approve each case.""We should never talk about 'therapeutic' abortion,"" Honduran Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga said in his homily. ""Therapeutic abortion doesn't exist. Therapeutic means curing, and abortion cures nothing. It takes innocent lives.""Journalist Ana Carolina Caceres, 24, survived microcephaly and thrived, even though doctors said she would never walk or talk.""When I read a report about the project by the [Brazilian] Supreme Federal Court to allow abortion in microcephaly cases, I took it personally,"" she said. ""I felt attacked and offended.""The bishops also criticized Brazilian officials over sanitation issues that allowed mosquitoes to multiply.O Globo reported that the government has recorded 1,499 notifications of the disease in the first 29 days of 2016. Doctors confirmed 64 Zika cases among those. Despite the outbreak, officials have not demanded that hospitals report confirmed Zika cases for tracking. Edimilson Migowski, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), claims the ""records of suspected cases account for only 2% of the total number of infected people, which is close to 75,000.""Migowski also blamed the city council for the disease because officials have not held an Index Survey on the Aedes aegypti mosquito since last October. These surveys track Aedes aegypti mosquitos, which carry the Zika virus. Silvia Cavalcantti, graduate coordinator in Microbiology UFF [Fluminense Federal University], placed the same complaint.""Working with a LIRAa [the survey] is something basic,"" she explained. ""Knowing the most affected areas is essential to promote more intensive actions against epidemics. If the surveys show that an area is at risk, agents can be relocated to minimize the effects.""She added, ""In addition, the work must be done all year. It's no use fighting the vector seasonally.""","breitbart","right","16839","zika",663
"By Dr. Robert MarionIn November, while reading the first accounts of the association between the Zika virus and congenital microcephaly, I immediately thought of Sir Norman McAlister Gregg. And while thinking of Dr. Gregg and all that's happened since he made his important observation in 1941, I hoped that we could learn from our past.In the spring of 1941, Gregg, a pediatric ophthalmologist in Australia, realized that he was seeing a marked increase in the number of children who'd been born with cataracts. The numbers were striking: in past years, he'd seen an average of five to 10 babies per year with cataracts; in 1940 to 1941, he was seeing more than 10 times those numbers.Though Gregg had no idea what was causing this increase, one day he overheard a group of mothers in his waiting room discussing the fact that they'd each had German measles during their pregnancies. This overheard conversation led him to question whether rubella might be responsible for their children's problems.Reviewing their case histories, Gregg found that 68 of the 78 infants with cataracts he'd seen during this period had been exposed to rubella during gestation. He also discovered that in addition to cataracts, many of these children had sensorineural deafness and congenital heart disease. In October 1941, he presented his findings in a paper, ""Congenital Cataract following German Measles in the Mother,"" at the Ophthalmological Society of Australia. Understanding threats to the wombGregg's observations were noteworthy for numerous reasons. Not only did his work introduce the concept of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) as a specific entity, it marked the first time an environmental agent had been implicated in causing damage to a developing conceptus. Prior to Gregg's paper, the prevailing view was that while in the womb, embryos and fetuses were impervious to damage from external sources. The concept of a virally induced congenital malformation syndrome opened the door to the possibility that other viruses (toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus), as well as drugs (thalidomide and Accutane), chemicals (methyl mercury) and environmental agents (radiation exposure), might also be harmful to developing humans.In the years following Gregg's observation, as rubella epidemics around the world left thousands of affected children in their wake, other features were added to the list first generated by the Australian ophthalmologist. Virtually every organ system can be affected.CRS and autism spectrum disordersIt also became clear that the timing of the infection is important: if the infection occurs early, a miscarriage could result; if the embryo survives, damage can occur to the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, bone marrow, bones, endocrine organs and brain, as well as to the eyes, ears and heart. The effect on the developing brain leads to the condition's most tragic consequences. Children with CRS are often left with severe, lifelong intellectual disabilities. Prominent among these disabilities are autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Following the epidemic in the early 1960s, Stella Chase and her colleagues at New York University reported ""a strikingly high prevalence of autism in a population"" of children with CRS. Her work pointed to CRS as one of the leading causes of ASDs in America in the 1970s.The devastating neurological consequences of CRS left little doubt that a vaccine against rubella was needed. In 1969, after years of work, the first rubella vaccine became available in the U.S. In 1971, it was combined with vaccines for mumps and measles, which had been developed earlier in the 1960s, to become the MMR vaccine.The MMR vaccine controversyThe effect of MMR on the incidence of rubella was rapid. In only a few years, this disabling disease virtually disappeared from the landscape. Most pediatricians who trained after 1975 have never seen an infant with CRS. The vaccine was almost a miracle.But one person's miracle can be another person's calamity. In the 1990s, the prevalence of ASDs soared. Although the dramatic rise in reported cases was almost certainly due to healthcare providers having become more sensitive to the symptoms and signs of the condition, this explanation was not acceptable to many parents. For these people, a more satisfying explanation came in 1998, when Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues published a paper in the Lancet (""Ileal-Lymphoid-Nodular Hyperplasia, Non-specific Colitis, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Children""), which claimed that MMR was responsible for a new syndrome: autistic enterocolitis.And so the vaccine that had been developed to prevent the leading cause of ASDs in the 1960s was now being blamed for fueling the ""epidemic"" of ASDs that occurred 30 years later. In the years following publication of Wakefield's article, not a single researcher could duplicate his findings, but the lack of evidence didn't matter: people who wanted to believe that their child's autism was caused by MMR would not be dissuaded.Is MMR's past Zika's future?It took 12 years and millions of research dollars to begin to correct the damage done by Wakefield. But even after 2010, when a tribunal found that he had acted dishonestly and irresponsibly in his published research, and the Lancet retracted the 1998 paper, many people (including U.S. presidential candidates) have continued to believe that a link exists between vaccines and ASDs.So in November, when I saw those photos of babies with small heads and read those first articles that linked congenital Zika infections with microcephaly, I believed I might be able to predict the future. I imagined that those small heads would prove to be only the tip of the iceberg for these unfortunate babies. In addition to microcephaly, they would be found to have brain malformations, neuromuscular and seizure disorders, intellectual disabilities, including ASDs, and an assortment of medical problems. The phenotype of what might be called Congenital Zika Syndrome would prove so significant, the suffering so severe, that researchers would band together to develop a vaccine. The vaccine, which would become universal in its use, would prove to be a huge success in stopping the epidemic. But in time, this miraculous vaccine would inevitably become the target of criticism, as people would come to believe that it itself was responsible for some new clinical problem.I hope that as we enter the age of Zika, we can learn from our experience with rubella, that although the development of a vaccine to prevent the tragedy of CZS will prove life-saving, it's almost inevitable that eventually, someone somewhere will blame this miraculous substance for causing one or another of the world's ills.  And when that happens, it's imperative that we in the scientific community urge the public to reserve judgment until definitive proof can be found to either prove or disprove the claim.

In addition, they wouldn't consider a short-term waiver from a redundant EPA regulation that would have allowed the spraying of FDA approved pesticides to eradicate many of the mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus.Very little is actually known about the Zika virus and its effects on unborn babies, yet Planned Parenthood has waged a massive birth control and abortion campaign - particularly in Latin American countries where abortion is currently illegal - and insisted that its abortion business should take the lead in the effort.""You know we're really at the beginning of understanding Zika in pregnancy,"" Rear Adm. Anne Schuchat, M.D., principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasized in her testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. She continued:According to the CDC, Zika is ""not currently being spread by mosquitoes in the continental United States. The mosquitoes that can carry Zika are found in some areas of the United States.""World reports that Dr. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said women who appear to be at risk to contract the Zika virus are mainly pregnant women who have never had the infection before and are in their first trimester of pregnancy. Among this small pool of women, only one in 100 will deliver a baby with microcephaly, the birth defect that has been linked to the Zika virus.Yet, Planned Parenthood Federation of America's executive vice President Dawn Laguens insisted, ""We are the front line of defense when it comes to battling Zika.""Laguens said it was ""shameful"" for Republicans ""to undermine the ability of family planning providers like Planned Parenthood to do what we do best in the midst of this rapidly spreading Zika virus, a public health crisis that directly targets women and children.""While the Zika virus has been found in semen - and some cases of sexually transmitted Zika have been reported - the CDC recommends use of condoms during sex but with the caveat, ""Condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika from sex. To be effective, condoms must be used correctly from start to finish, every time you have vaginal, anal and oral (mouth-to-penis) sex.""Ironically, there is little discussion that abstinence should be the method of choice to avoid Zika transmission sexually.Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons places the concerns about Zika in perspective.Writing at Heartland Institute about the Zika ""scare,"" Orient states:Orient is among the experts who say lifting the ban on DDT would rid the world of the Zika virus and some other mosquito-borne illnesses as well.""The ban on DDT was basically the decision of one man, William Ruckelshaus [the first head of the EPA], going against a mountain of evidence on safety and enormous health benefits,"" Orient told Breitbart News. ""It was said that, 'If they can ban DDT, they can ban anything.' And that's how the EPA power grab started. Millions of African babies have died and are still dying of malaria because if it.""""Substitute pesticides are far more toxic and expensive,"" she added. ""People are advised to use insect repellents such as DEET - which is absorbed through the skin, and safety in pregnancy is not established.""Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases explained at a recent news conference that Brazil was able to stop the spread of Zika during the 50s and 60s through the use of DDT.","breitbart","right","16999","zika",643
"Brazilian abortion activists face an uphill battle as they lobby for fewer restrictions in a heavily Catholic country where many of the women most affected by Zika virus hold anti-abortion views. The virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be causing a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   And across the world, scientists in China, India and Singapore -- each of which have large populations and histories of mosquito-related infectious disease outbreaks -- are under pressure to develop a Zika virus detection kit, a task that's made even more challenging because none of their labs has access to live Zika samples.With the high volume of news about the Zika virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps. Here's the latest information you should know: China reported its first case of Zika virus in the city of Ganzhou, according to China's official Xinhua news agency. The 34-year-old patient had recently traveled to Venezuela and had been treated for Zika virus there before returning to China. Chinese health authorities stressed that the risk of Zika spreading in China is currently low, because the country's cold winter temperatures are inhospitable to mosquitos. The virus could take hold if introduced in Hong Kong. It's home to Aedes albopictus mosquitos, a vector for dengue fever, which is similar to Zika, and a relative of the Zika-carrying species Aedes aegypti.Since last summer, two people in Finland have tested positive for Zika virus. In one case, the patient traveled to Maldives and returned to Finland in June. The country's health officials declined to give more details on the other, more recent Zika case, Reuters reported. Brazilian women's groups who plan to appeal its supreme court to loosen the country's abortion laws face numerous obstacles, Reuters reports. Heavily Catholic with a rapidly growing Evangelical community, the country isn't in favor of decriminalizing abortion, according to two 2010 polls. The poor in Brazil also tend to hold staunchly anti-abortion views, despite the fact that low-income communities have been hardest hit by Zika virus and microcephaly, the birth defect to which it is linked.However, Brazilian women are still getting abortions. Approximately 850,000 Brazilian women have illegal abortions each year, a dangerous practice that's also the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Brazilian officials say the games will go on and stress that mosquito activity is typically low in August, which falls during mid-winter in Brazil. Some scientists disagree with the country's official stance, however, and caution that drier, cooler temperatures don't mean the Zika-carrying mosquitos will be gone. Mosquito eggs can remain dormant for more than a year, and hatch without warning if there's a surge in heat or humidity. ""Weather is relative,"" Nancy Bellei, director of clinical virology at the Brazilian Society of Infectology, told Reuters. ""You can't just hope for cool temperatures and hope that the virus won't spread.""There's also the risk that a large international gathering will spread the virus even more quickly. While the risk for individual travelers is low, some Olympic athletes and coaches are concerned about bringing the virus home. The Kenyan Olympic team, for example, is considering withdrawing from the Rio games entirely.Scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will study Zika virus' link to Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. It can result in tingling in the legs and arms, muscle weakness, temporary paralysis and, in some rare cases, death. CDC neuroepidemiologist Dr. James Sejvar has already done a similar study in Brazil, but told Reuters that new research in Puerto Rico will be prospective, more intense and catch patients at the beginning of their illness, when they are sickest. Puerto Rico has 22 cases of Zika virus as of Feb 5. Scientists in China, India and Singapore are racing to make a detection kit for Zika virus. Because of their large populations and/or experience with past mosquito-borne outbreaks, these countries consider a fast, reliable and widely-available diagnostic tool a matter of vital importance. There's just one thing standing in their way: nobody there has any live samples of the Zika virus to work with, Reuters reports. One unnamed source from the team of Indian researchers told Reuters that development would be finished in less than a month if they could just get a sample of the live virus. Experts in Singapore expect testing kits for Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses, which are all carried by the same mosquito, to hit hospitals by the end of March. ","huffingtonpost","left","16841","zika",948
"McKayla Maroney gave the world a ""not impressed"" facial expression. Gabby Douglas follows up with a ""not impressed"" statement.The owner of two Olympic gold medals says that the much-hyped Zika threats do not frighten her away from traveling to the Summer Games in Rio.""It's the Olympics,"" a bemused Douglas told reporters at a meet in Hartford on Friday. ""It's the Olympics. Mosquitoes? Like, whatever-I'm going. This is my shot. I don't care about no stupid bugs.""The Fierce Five gymnast's fierce approach contrasts with the caution of cyclist Tejay van Garderen, a fellow 2012 Olympian once widely expected to make the 2016 American team. He opted out of the Rio Games late last week out of fears he could transmit Zika to his pregnant wife Jessica and unborn child.""If Jessica were not pregnant right now, assuming I was selected, I would go,"" van Garderen explained to CyclingTips.com. ""But the fact is, she is pregnant. If we were just going to start trying, I'd say we could start trying six months after the Olympics. But when she has a baby in her belly, I don't want to take any chances.""The mosquito-borne illness can cause microcephaly in infants and prolonged flu-like symptoms and neurological issues in adults. Though a majority of healthy adults overcome the illness once diagnosed, Zika can kill people of any age group. But symptoms usually remain so mild that most people who get it don't even know they have it.And given past scares over Ebola in 2014, SARS in 2003, and the swine flu in 1975 that resulted in 25 deaths from a vaccine pushed by an hysterical federal government but only one death from the spread of the actual disease, Giffords may rightly mock the possibility of contracting Zika let alone suffering serious consequences from it. She performs in an indoor, air-conditioned venue, after all.Gymnastics hopeful Simone Biles, like her teammate, remains unimpressed by threats from the bug-borne illness.""We're so young,"" she explained.

"Health officials in Colombia are following the footsteps of their Brazilian counterparts after a surge in the number of cases of Zika virus in the country, a disease similar to Dengue fever that has been linked to severe birth defects in pregnant patients.""It is recommended that women postpone - to the extent possible - the decision to become pregnant until the country can move out of the epidemic phase of the Zika virus,"" the Health Ministry of Colombia advised in a statement in early January. As the Southern Hemisphere reaches the health of summer 2016, Colombian officials are estimating that doctors may diagnose up to 700,000 cases of Zika virus infection this year. The numbers are no different for the mosquito carrying the disease from the last summer, explains Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria: ""We expect an expansion similar to what we had with the chikungunya virus last year, to finish with between 600,000 to 700,000 cases.""Currently, Colombia has documented more than 13,500 cases of Zika, according to Reuters, the most of any country except Brazil. Among those are 560 pregnant women, whose children are the most at risk.Zika virus is transmitted through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which also spread chikungunya, Dengue fever, and yellow fever. The disease itself, when contaminating adults, is not considered grave: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) note that no adult is known to have died from Zika, and that its symptoms are similar to Dengue, but milder.The virus has profoundly damaging effects on in utero fetuses, however, which are not yet fully understood. Brazilian health officials have documented that nearly 4,000 infants born of mothers carrying Zika have microcephaly, a condition in which the skull is smaller than the brain, causing significant cognitive defects and, sometimes, death. At least five children have been confirmed dead of microcephaly after being born of mothers carrying Zika in Brazil.","breitbart","right","16821","zika",310
"The great HG Wells once said, ""Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe."" As we discover more and more about the spread of and serious outcomes from Zika infection, it's clear that we urgently must prepare for this latest threat.  At the same time, we must also ask ourselves why we were caught by surprise and try to unravel the root causes of the unfolding Zika tragedy.As the Centers for Disease Control, the White House administration and other federal and state agencies grapple with how best to deal with Zika, it's critical that we all take special note of communities that are likely to face even greater threats than the general population from these diseases. Individuals living near or below the poverty line are at higher risk of exposure to the mosquitoes that carry Zika virus.Take a moment and look at these two maps. Some of the most impoverished urban areas in the United States are also located in the Aedes aegypti mosquito belt.1) The most impoverished areas in the United States - Source: U.S. Census - 20142) The estimated range of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (mosquitos that cause Zika, dengue fever and other vector-borne diseases) in the United States (2016) - Source: CDCWhy does this matter? Mosquito control measures and surveillance techniques are critical to respond to any potential disease outbreak.  Particular attention must address impoverished areas where small outbreaks can turn into epidemics.  Communities in the US with sanitation, improved housing, and air conditioning are less likely to be exposed to Zika or any other vector-borne diseases, like dengue fever or West Nile virus. However, in the US places with inadequate housing in densely populated urban areas often create perfect conditions for mosquitoes to breed and transmit viruses. Once infected, persons with insufficient access to healthcare can potentially seed new cases amplifying risks throughout the community.While there's still a great deal we don't know about how far Zika will spread in the United States or the degree of severity, there are several things we do know:Changing climate conditions are creating ideal environments for the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to breed (NOAA predicts the unprecedented strong El Niño is expected to hang around throughout the spring and early summer of 2016)Even small changes in climate conditions can impact how quickly vector-borne diseases evolve and spreadThe mosquitos capable of spreading the Zika virus are already in the United States, making Zika transmission a near certainty in the United States We also know that the administration must be willing to address poverty if it hopes to prevent the spread of future epidemics like Zika, starting with those areas in the United States where high poverty rates overlap with the known range of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. As the CDC and local health departments in the US accelerate efforts in preparation for the soon arrival of locally transmitted Zika virus, they should target poor communities with the highest risk.  Mosquito traps for surveillance should be located in these poorer populations to quickly know when mosquitoes might start carrying Zika virus in that location. At the same time, housing improvement programs (both governmental and non governmental) should focus on: 1) repairing window screens and eliminating mosquito breeding sites; and 2) arduously educating communities toward this end. Remember, Aedes aegypi is known as the ""small container breeding mosquito,"" therefore, any yard debris, flower pots, and other containers prone to catching rainwater should be dealt with. The costs for prevention may be high, but the significantly higher healthcare costs and substantial human suffering due to a volatile epidemic would be unimaginable.  In the end, if we succeed in preventing disease in those communities that are most vulnerable, we will more likely succeed in preventing disease for all of us.","huffingtonpost","left","16920","zika",652
"By Susan Blumenthal, MD, MPA and Ladan Fakory, MPAWith as many as 500,000 spectators and more than 10,500 athletes expected to attend the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro this summer, the world is racing to contain the mysterious, mosquito-borne Zika virus that has infected more than 120,000 people in Brazil  since 2015. Several athletes and journalists have already said they will not attend this year's games. It's no wonder why: The disease causes microcephaly, a rare birth defect - never before associated with a viral infection - that causes babies of some pregnant women, infected with the virus, to be born with underdeveloped heads and brains. More than 1,300 cases of confirmed microcephaly in infants born to mothers who were infected with Zika during pregnancy have been reported in Brazil. Another 3,300 cases are still being investigated. Earlier this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed that there are currently 234 pregnant women in the continental United States who are infected with the Zika virus and 189 in the US territories. The CDC reports that three babies have been born in America with birth defects caused by the virus, and another three pregnancies ended in either miscarriage or termination where there were signs of Zika-related abnormalities. All of the cases reported in the U.S. were connected to travel to regions of the world with outbreaks of the mosquito-borne virus.The likelihood of a woman who was infected with the Zika virus during pregnancy giving birth to a baby with microcephaly is estimated to be as high as 13 percent. With approximately 4 out of 5 people infected with Zika having no symptoms, researchers studying the outbreak in Colombia reported last week that even pregnant women who don't show symptoms of infection are at risk of having babies with microcephaly.  Additionally, physicians are concerned that infants might experience other neurological damage and developmental problems as a result of in-utero Zika infection that could affect a child's vision, hearing, cognition, and behavior. These alarming consequences led the World Health Organization (WHO) to issue interim guidance on June 7, 2016 that those living in Zika affected areas ""be correctly informed and oriented to consider delaying pregnancy."" Adults have experienced an autoimmune disease associated with the virus called Guillain-Barré syndrome that can result in paralysis. To date, several people infected with Zika have died.On June 14, 2016, the WHO convened the third meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee to assess the impact of Zika and concluded that the risks posed by the virus are not high enough to postpone or move the 2016 Olympic Games. Pregnant women are advised not to travel to Brazil for the Olympics. The Committee's experts also restated the importance of the availability and use of insect repellent and condoms for athletes and visitors, intensified vector control measures, enhanced surveillance, risk communication, and clinical care. The WHO strongly advises people returning from areas with local Zika infection transmission to adopt safer sex practices, consider abstinence, and delay pregnancy for at least 8 weeks upon return, and 6 months if the male partner has shown any symptoms of infection.With no vaccine or treatment for Zika, or indeed much knowledge about who is most at risk for complications of the disease currently available, 150 bioethicists, scientists, physicians, and public health professionals wrote a letter to the World Health Organization (WHO) on May 27, 2016 urging that the Olympic Games be postponed or relocated. They worry that some athletes and spectators will become infected while in Rio and then carry the virus back to their home countries, further spreading the disease worldwide. This would be of particular concern for countries where the virus is not endemic and for developing nations that do not have adequate health infrastructure to prevent the disease's spread and where mosquito vectors exist for transmission. They argue that major sporting events have been moved before; for example, the Women's World Soccer Cup in 2002 was relocated from China over concerns about the swine flu. In their letter to the WHO, these experts believe that just a few infected travelers in several countries or continents could result in a ""full blown global health disaster."" Additionally, there is a ""perfect storm"" brewing in Rio with financial and politic problems that could impact the course of the Zika epidemic there.However, other scientists suggest that the number of Zika cases will decline during August-September, the winter months in Brazil, when the Olympics are scheduled to occur. However, recent seasonal patterns for diseases, like dengue, carried by the same Aedes aegypti mosquito, suggest that while the Zika outbreak might well ebb during the summer, it will most likely not disappear entirely. Furthermore, given the effects of climate change, some mosquitos are thriving in winter months that are warmer than in previous years. Another concern expressed by some experts is that the Asian strain of Zika (believed to be introduced to Brazil in 2013 and subsequently to other South and Central American countries) appears to have higher rates of serious complications, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, as compared to the African strain. More research is needed on these observations, and on other aspects of the disease.  In terms of concerns about Zika transmission in America, it is interesting to note that despite more than a million cases of chikungunya (a viral disease carried by the same mosquitos as Zika) reported in the Caribbean, Latin and South America over the past several years, this disease did not spread throughout the United States.  Additionally, a report of last week's number of cases suggests that the chikungunya's incidence has declined dramatically over the past months except in certain countries including Brazil, Colombia, the Honduras, and Bolivia. This is likely due to ""herd"" immunity-a large number of people have been infected already-- and a drought in the Caribbean. Thus, given there have only been small localized outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya in the United States (mainly in the Southwest including Florida and Texas), despite larger outbreaks elsewhere in the world, this pattern of small outbreaks will probably be the case with Zika in America as well. However, we really don't know for sure.But what we do know is this: Tens of thousands of tourists packed into outdoor stadiums and event venues at the Olympics this summer is worrisome to athletes and spectators when there is a mosquito-borne disease at large. To address these concerns, the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently issued statements to reassure the public that changing or cancelling the location of the 2016 Olympics would not significantly alter the international spread of the disease. These organizations note that many people already travel to and from Brazil every month for many reasons, and that, since 2007, mosquito-borne transmission of Zika has been reported in more than 60 countries and territories worldwide and in 40 countries in the Americas alone. Ten countries have reported person-to-person transmission of the virus. According to Dr. Tom Frieden, Director of the CDC, ""The Olympics would represent less than 0.25 percent of all travel to Zika affected areas.""  He states, ""So even if the Olympics were called off, we'd still be left with 99.75 percent of the risk of Zika continuing to spread.""While the WHO and CDC statements provide general reassurance that the Rio Olympic games this summer do not pose an increased risk of Zika transmission given the sheer volume of travel that already occurs to and from Brazil, the actual risk of further Zika spread as a result of the Games is difficult to accurately predict. To address this issue, several epidemiologists have developed a mathematical model based on estimating how many mosquitos will be in Rio during the Games to determine the chance that spectators and athletes could be infected during this three-week period. Their preliminary model suggests a 1 in 31,000 chance of contracting Zika during the Olympics in Rio - that means 16 cases- as compared to a 1 in 11 million chance of dying in a plane crash or a 1 in 9,100 chance of being killed in a car accident in the United States this year. According to this mathematical model, keeping the Games in Rio would not change the course of the epidemic globally. Similarly, a San Paulo-based research group confirms this prediction, estimating that attendance at the Rio Olympics would result in a maximum of 15 Zika infections among the visitors. Given the public's fears about contracting Zika at the Games, Rio's Olympic organizers convened a briefing on June 7th, with the city's chief medical expert emphasizing these results from the mathematical modeling --that Zika is expected to affect only an estimated 1.8 people per 1 million tourists -15 people--during the three weeks of the Olympic competition.  According to the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, attendees are much more likely to experience food poisoning during the Olympics in Brazil than to become infected with Zika. A number of scientists also believe that if an international event were to have furthered the spread of Zika, it would have been the Carnival festivities in February when Rio was hosting a million visitors and when mosquito proliferation was at its peak.However, other experts believe there are limitations to the statistical mathematical approach described above. It should be remembered that this public health issue is not just about the number of cases, but also about whether infected people traveling back to their countries might trigger a new outbreak somewhere in the world, especially in slum-dwelling environments where WHO and CDC precautions and preventive strategies may not be implemented .Additionally some ethicists and scientific experts argue that core principles animating the Olympic Games provide a counter argument to convening the Olympic competition in Rio this summer under these circumstances. An article published in the Harvard Public Health Review quotes the International Olympic Committee statement: ""Olympism seeks to create  social responsibility and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles."" If any Olympic athletes or spectators attending the 2016 games in Rio become infected with the virus and return to their respective countries and then transmit the disease to others, this would represent a violation of the Games' principles of social responsibility, which if interpreted broadly, would include not spreading an infectious disease. These concerns are echoed by bioethicist, Dr. Arthur Caplan, who writes that the WHO is ""betting on the weather, responsible behavior by visitors, adequate mosquito control and a low sexual-transmission rate by returning visitors. All are gambles.""What is clear is that the ongoing spread and impact of the Zika virus is yet another wake-up call after the Ebola outbreak last year that infectious diseases pose significant threats to human health and international security. On February 1, 2016, WHO declared that the Zika outbreak was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Experts estimate that 2.17 billion people are living in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where Zika-carrying mosquitos can thrive. According to the WHO, as many as 4 million Zika cases are predicted in the Western hemisphere alone by the end of 2016. There is increasing concern that the disease could affect people living in the United States during the upcoming summer season. As of June 15, 2016, there have been 756 Zika cases reported in 46 U.S. states and Washington D.C. (none of which have been locally transmitted), and 1,440 cases reported in 3 U.S. territories, with 1,386 cases in Puerto Rico alone. The virus is a particular threat to Puerto Rico, where local transmission is occurring. It has been estimated that as many as 25% of people residing there may become infected with the Zika virus.Thus far, local transmission of Zika has not occurred in the continental U.S. states. However, U.S. officials are gearing up to deploy ""rapid response teams"" of 10-15 experts to any community that has even one case of infection to help local authorities monitor cases, perform laboratory tests, and increase mosquito control efforts. States considered most vulnerable to Zika transmission during the summer months include Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. On June 14, 2016, an Interim CDC Zika Response Plan, a step-by step emergency plan, was released, and on June 13, 2016, applications were due to CDC to apply for $85 million in funds to fight Zika in communities. If local transmission of the virus occurs in North America, the Aedes aegypti mosquito would likely be the primary vector in urban areas and southern U.S. states along the Gulf Coast, whereas the Aedes albopictus mosquito could play a role in transmission due to its distribution as far as New England and the lower Great Lakes. The global transportation of cargo and travel by people are largely responsible for introducing these mosquito vectors across countries and continents. In addition, environmental changes including urbanization, dam construction, deforestation, and rising temperatures linked to climate change have increased the number of locations around the world in which these mosquitos can thrive. That's why intensified efforts are underway to fight this virus including the development of vaccines to prevent further transmission and rapid early diagnostic methods. An experimental vaccine for the Zika virus will begin human testing for safety and appropriate dosage in the coming weeks after receiving approval from the FDA. The vaccine works by priming the immune system to fight Zika by introducing genetically-engineered material that mimics the virus in the body. In animal studies of this vaccine, antibodies were developed that attacked the virus. However, confirming the safety and effectiveness of any Zika vaccine will require large scale studies that would not be completed until 2017. Additionally, in recent months, several rapid diagnostic Zika blood and urine tests have also received emergency use authorization from the FDA.As with the Ebola outbreak last year, the ongoing Zika pandemic underscores the importance of prevention and public health preparedness in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases and promoting global health. Since 1976, as many as three new infectious diseases have emerged each year: HIV/AIDS, SARS, Lyme's Disease, H1N1 influenza, Ebola, MERS, and West Nile encephalitis are just some of the most serious and headline grabbing ones. As of 2014, more than 346 infectious diseases were linked to 16% of all human deaths worldwide.Given the urgency of Zika as a public health threat, the Obama Administration requested $1.8 billion to fight the disease. Alarmingly, the Republican majority in Congress did not approve its request.  Consequently, on April 6, 2016, the Administration redirected $589 million in unspent funding to combat Ebola to fight the Zika epidemic. Escalating public concerns about the potential spread of the disease to America has resulted in Congress currently debating what level of additional funding should be provided to fight this disease. By investing in research (which has still not occurred at an adequate level) toward the discovery of a vaccine and antiviral treatments as well as building emergency preparedness infrastructure, human suffering and the long-term costs of caring for children with microcephaly, and people with Guillain-Barré syndrome and other health damaging complications of infection with the virus can be averted. Additionally, the results of increased knowledge about Zika should pay dual dividends to help fight other infectious diseases as well.People can continue to debate where the Olympics should be held this summer, but Zika is a global problem regardless of where athletes go for gold this summer, a public health threat that requires more resources and research to eradicate.  On May 6, 2016, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced the establishment of a targeted ""UN Zika Response Multi-Partner Trust Fund,"" which will provide a rapid, flexible, and accountable platform to support a coordinated response to support the global Zika Strategic Response Framework and Joint Operations Plan in consultation with UN agencies, partners, and international public health experts. Donors will contribute to a central ""fund"" and an Advisory Committee will direct monies to priority activities and programs. This is an important step forward, but we believe and have proposed that this Zika Fund be expanded and established as a ""Global Health Security Fund,"" a permanent entity to support the international response to all emerging infectious disease threats now and in the future.  On May 20, the World Bank launched an innovative $500 million insurance fund to address some of this need. The new Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) will help in the fight against pandemics in poor countries. In the event of an outbreak, the facility will rapidly release monies to an affected nation and qualified global first responder organizations. The fund creates the first insurance market for pandemic risk. The Bank estimates that if the PEF had existed in mid-2014 as the Ebola outbreak was rapidly spreading in West Africa, as much as $100 million could have been mobilized by July to limit the spread of the epidemic. Instead, resources did not begin flowing until about three months later permitting Ebola cases to increase by ten-fold during that period of time.Last month, at the G-7 meeting in Tokyo, pandemic planning was a prominent issue with the group's endorsement of the Global Health Security Agenda. The G-7 has reached out to more than 70 countries to assist them in implementation of the WHO International Health Regulations. However, only about one-third of nations globally have the resources and public health infrastructure to respond effectively to public health emergencies like Zika creating vulnerabilities worldwide. That is why pandemic planning and response is essential with coordination of efforts, robust early detection methods, disease surveillance, and reporting systems, as well as investments in new vaccines, treatments, and prevention strategies. Community education and mobilization is critical, as well as creating a Pandemic Response Corps of trained health professionals, lab technicians, and other health providers, who can be rapidly mobilized when an outbreak occurs anywhere in the world.The bottom line: focusing global attention on where the Olympics should be run this summer while failing to commit the necessary time, money, and action to combat the Zika virus is not a winning strategy. Throughout history, infectious diseases have killed more people than wars, making them powerful international enemies and decisive shapers of history. They remain clear and present dangers to human health, economic development, and national security in an interconnected 21st century world, and we must remain vigilant against them. That is why a medical marathon is needed, making significant investments now to strengthen the scientific knowledge base, developing new global health technologies including rapid testing methods that can be deployed in combination with proven public health practices, as well as strengthening health systems with a coordinated national and international response. These efforts will enhance our ability to fight Zika and other emerging infectious disease threats more swiftly and effectively, moving from peril to progress in the years ahead. Intensifying public concern about the spread of the Zika virus worldwide underscores that microbes are ticking time bombs against the health of humanity and failure to fight them is not an option.Susan Blumenthal, M.D., M.P.A. is the Public Health Editor of The Huffington Post.

"Pregnant couples in which a male partner may have been exposed to the mosquito-borne Zika virus should use condoms during vaginal, anal and oral sex or be abstinent in order to prevent sexual transmission of the disease, according to new federal guidelines. That's because sexually transmitting Zika virus to a pregnant partner may pose a threat to the fetus' development in the womb, resulting in birth defects. If pregnant women or their partners have traveled to an area with active Zika transmission, the guidelines say, they should discuss this potential exposure with an OB/GYN in order to determine if extra testing and evaluation is needed during the pregnancy.  So far the only bodily fluid associated with sex in which Zika has been found is sperm. And it's currently unknown how long a person who has had Zika virus will be able to transmit the disease sexually, so researchers have yet to be determined how long men need to use condoms during sex to avoid passing the disease to someone else. These new guidelines were released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, two days after the agency confirmed that the first-ever local transmission of Zika virus in the U.S. happened through sexual contact. An unnamed patient in Dallas got the virus after sleeping with a partner who had recently traveled from Venezuela.The Dallas case appears to confirm the likelihood of two initial reports of possible sexual transmission of Zika virus. The first case study, published in 2011, suggests that a man who contracted the disease while working in Senegal went on to sexually transmit it to his wife when he returned to his home in Colorado. The second case study reported that a Tahitian man showed signs of the virus in his semen, despite the fact that his blood no longer contained any traces of the pathogen.The main mode of Zika virus transmission remains mosquito bites; the insect picks up the disease from an infected person and then transmits it to a second person. This method hasn't happened in the U.S. yet, although the CDC said last week that a small, time-limited outbreak of Zika virus here is ""likely.""Here are the CDC's complete guidelines on sexual transmission of the virus, broken down by situation: Use condoms during vaginal, anal and oral sex or be abstinent in order to prevent potential sexual transmission of the disease. You should also discuss both partners' travel history with an OB/GYN to determine if extra testing and evaluation is needed during the pregnancy. Use condoms consistently during sex or consider abstaining, the CDC advised.Before you make the decision to use condoms and/or abstain, the CDC wants you to know that the virus itself is usually mild. Symptoms can last up to one week, but 80 percent of infected people never even experience them.Beyond simply being in an area with active Zika transmission, risk for the disease depends on how long a person was there, how many mosquito bites they got and the steps that were taken to prevent bites.Talk to your doctor to consider getting tested for Zika virus. However, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said in a press conference about these guidelines that pregnant women will be prioritized first for Zika virus testing. If you're of reproductive age, discuss family planning and contraception strategies with your doctor with an eye toward mitigating Zika virus risk. The CDC's previous advice recommended Zika virus testing only for pregnant women who have disease symptoms (fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis) or whose ultrasounds reveal cranial abnormalities in their fetus.Now, the CDC says doctors can offer you Zika virus testing from two to 12 weeks after your trip to an area affected by the disease, or immediately if you show symptoms.The CDC also recommends that if you're pregnant but asymptomatic, you get a Zika virus test at the beginning of prenatal care and then a follow-up around the middle of the second trimester if you live in an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission.And, in keeping with the CDC's initial set of guidelines for pregnant travelers, you should discuss with your doctors if additional ultrasounds are necessary to keep a close eye on fetal development. Signs of microcephaly, the birth defect associated with Zika virus infection, only show up on ultrasound scans around the end of the second trimester, notes the New York Times.  Also on the Huffington Post: ","huffingtonpost","left","16836","zika",894
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that it has been able to confirm that the Zika virus causes microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome.""Based on a growing body of preliminary research, there is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome,"" they wrote in their weekly situation report.They added:Microcephaly occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems. Brazilian officials believe Zika caused ""most"" of the 5,000 cases of microcephaly since the outbreak started.In February, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said that doctors confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly.Guillain-Barré causes paralysis in those diagnosed with it. A survivor based in New York City told CBS News his joints ""felt like lead weights."" The ""prize-winning Brazilian-American well known in the performing arts"" did not want CBS to identify him.The man known as João and twelve colleagues contracted Zika last spring while in Brazil. He developed Guillain-Barré syndrome shortly after he recovered from Zika.""I was on my way to the airport to leave and had to turn back,"" he claimed.He decided to seek treatment at a private hospital, since the public hospitals had too many patients. João then spent two more weeks in bed at home.""Everyone knows the Zika symptoms, because so many people get it. With Guillain-Barré, I was paralyzed, I could not walk. All of my joints felt like lead weights,"" he said.WHO declared the Zika virus a public health emergency on February 1 due to the thousands of cases of the virus linked to birth defects in newborn children.""I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities reported in Latin America following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014 constitutes a public health emergency of international concern,"" announced WHO director general Margaret Chan.She added: ""This is an extraordinary event. It poses a public health threat to other parts of the world and a coordinated international response is needed.""","breitbart","right","16899","zika",367
"""What do we do if a few months from now, when mosquito season arrives, hundreds or thousands of low-income women in Texas and Florida find themselves pregnant with fetuses that show severe brain damage?""There is nothing that binds the Republican Party together so much as its fervent opposition to safe, legal abortion. Even more than their fondness for guns, Republicans, men and women alike, will reflexively default to abortion as the rationale for their political beliefs. Ask people in red states who, from a common-sense economic perspective, would seem to belong in the Democratic camp why they continue to pull the red lever for their local Congressman even as the quality of their lives crumble all around them, with only the uber-wealthy reaping the rewards, and you will hear the same refrain: they'd vote Democratic if only it wasn't for (guns and) abortion.The leading Republican presidential candidates reflect this. Ted Cruz would outlaw all abortion, pure and simple. Criminalize it, throw women in jail for having one. Donald Trump, whose views change week to week, claims he's against all abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. Marco Rubio says no exceptions-if a woman is raped and impregnated, even by her father or brother, Rubio would force her to have that baby.But that may all change in a few short months. You see, summer's coming. For politicians it'll be a time of barbecues and town halls and mingling with the constituents in rolled up shirt-sleeves. And we're about to get an influx of new citizens. Millions of them, actually. They're coming to live in the ""Red States"" first and they're going to be here for quite a while:The Aedes aegypti mosquito that is the primary vector of Zika virus infections is present in the southeast portion of the country, including Florida, though in winter the mosquito populations are low.Last week the World Health Organization declared the spread of the Zika virus a ""global health emergency,""  a rare move for the W.H.O.   Although the precise trajectory of the mosquito-borne virus cannot be predicted, it's fairly clear that it is just a matter of time before it reaches the Southern U.S., and several cases in Florida have already been reported in travelers returning from South America.  Mosquitos carrying Zika are expected to reach North Carolina by this summer. Current estimates vary widely as to the scope of potential exposure in the U.S., from ""small outbreaks,"" or ""a few hundred cases at a time"" nationally, to something rather more significant:Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, has fears. He recalls spending much of 2014 insisting that the Ebola outbreak would not become a significant problem in the United States. But he gives no such assurance now.""I think we're in for real trouble in the United States,"" he said, considering how swiftly Zika can spread. He focuses on conditions throughout the Gulf Coast, where stagnant water sources - in uncollected garbage, discarded tires, untended bird baths - can be ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes much of the year.Aedes Aegypti, carrier of the Zika virusFor the record, some scientists are not quite ready to say that this creature on the right is why thousands of babies so far have been born in Brazil with underdeveloped brains and abnormally small heads. At this point I think we can take it on faith that there is such a connection. What isn't in doubt is that microcephalic babies we're seeing in the news reports are not the happy and smiling variety.  Many of the pictures we've seen show them crying or screaming, or else staring blankly. They're crying or screaming or staring blankly because they are permanently disabled. Babies born with microcephaly have a whole host of problems, many of them permanent, including seizures, convulsions, developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, hearing loss, vision problems, as well as deformed limbs and skulls. It's fairly horrifying, and whatever happens in terms of the overall exposure in the U.S, it's a safe bet that this will be a prime topic of discussion this summer, with a lot of anxious and scared Americans, particularly in the South. While its means of transmission are just now beginning to be understood, the threat to pregnant women is fairly established fact at this point, although the quantum of risk is not.  At some point women who are pregnant or seeking to become pregnant are going to demand testing to ensure they do not have the Zika virus. For those that do, there is an agonizing decision to make. All of that ""sanctity of life"" claptrap suddenly rings very hollow when you're faced with the fact that you may be pregnant with a profoundly disabled child. (The quote at the top of this post was taken from this article by Cloe Angyal, writing for the Huffington Post, examining the implications of women's rights versus those of the disabled which may be on a collision course because of Zika).But there's one more little wrinkle:[M]icrocephaly in a fetus cannot be detected until well into the second trimester of a pregnancy. ""Late in the first trimester you can see the complete absence of the brain, anencephaly, but not microcephaly,"" says Davis, who is also an abortion provider who performs second-trimester abortions.Waiting until the second trimester to determine whether your baby is going to be severely disabled both physically and mentally is an experience most women are understandably going to want to avoid. And then there's the cost factor:Abortion at this point in a pregnancy is rare and hard to come by. It's expensive -- often well over $1,000 -- and that's before you factor in the cost of traveling and accommodation to see the few providers who perform the procedure, skipping days of work for travel and recovery (and waiting periods in between appointments, which some states require), securing childcare for any kids you might already have, and so on. ""Once you detect [a fetal abnormality], it's not like you have an ultrasound and right that second they say 'OK, if it's the right choice for you, you can have your abortion,'"" Davis says. The longer a woman waits -- to make her choice, or to raise the money to exercise it -- the more expensive the procedure becomes.Waiting also brings with it a whole host of anguishing decisions to be made as microcephaly is not uniform, across the board. There are different degrees which depending on the diagnosis, might impact a woman's desire to have the baby:Pregnant women who choose to have an abortion when microcephaly shows up in fetal testing have an enormously difficult decision to make, Davis said. She does her best to explain to expecting families what they can expect their child's life to be like. ""It depends on the severity of the microcephaly,"" she said. ""There's a range, and you do have some information about that from ultrasounds.Meanwhile, against what could very well become a severe public health emergency, Republicans from state legislatures to the U.S. Congress to the United States Supreme Court have done their damnedest to make a woman's legal choice to terminate her pregnancy as difficult as possible. In Texas and other states, women have to drive hundreds of miles and make repeat visits, only to hear some right-wing doctor try to guilt them into a forced birth against their will. In some states they are forced to endure ""waiting periods."" In some states they are forced to look at ultrasounds they don't wish to view, or forced to read literature they don't want to read, or provided with pictures they don't want to look at. In some states they are screamed at and threatened by protesters as they walk into a clinic. Some states, such as Ohio, have even passed laws forcing women to carry babies to term with known birth defects. This was all fine and dandy with the Republican men who run the Republican Party, and very popular with its so-called Christian ""base.""But when our winged friends from South America arrive here this summer or early fall-and there's no reason to suspect they won't-any woman who gets a mosquito bite and becomes pregnant is going to be getting a test for Zika. And if that test is positive, for the reasons explained above,  most women are not going to sit around and wait until the ""second trimester"" to determine whether they want to terminate their pregnancy.  This is particularly the case if the media is hyperventilating about the risk, which is bound to happen (see Ebola).  Many may choose to terminate their pregnancy as soon as they find out they're pregnant and carrying the virus. Anyone who stands in their way is going to earn their undying wrath, and deservedly so. They're not going to tolerate ""waiting periods."" They're not going to tolerate ""counseling,"" or being forced to look at ultrasounds or read right-wing literature. But those are the laws that govern a woman's right to make her own reproductive decisions, courtesy the Republican Party. And guess what? There's no exception for Zika.There are already parallels being drawn between Zika and rubella:Doctors say the rampant spread of Zika virus in the Americas evokes parallels to the rubella epidemic in the 1960s that disabled thousands of children in the U.S. and worldwide, prompting many women to seek illegal abortions""The fear that people have in these countries is similar to the fear we experienced in the early 1960s when rubella was king,"" says Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""Mothers were scared to death about contracting rubella in the first trimester of pregnancy, because their child would have an 85 percent chance of developing severe permanent defects of the ears, eyes and heart.""The issue is already roiling Brazilian society, the epicenter of what is now being characterized as the Zika epidemic. Brazil has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world, and these laws are now being challenged. In Brazil, there is fierce opposition to changing the laws from Catholic bishops.But we are not Brazil, and abortion is legal here, at least theoretically. What are Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, or the entire Republican Party going to say when faced with potentially hundreds or thousands of people, from all economic strata, demanding the right to legally terminate their pregnancies quickly and efficiently? Are they going to make an ""exception"" to their rabid forced birth positions for Zika? How exactly would that work?  As pointed out by Sara Seltzer, writing for Jezebel, are they going to look women in the eye and say that they must carry these microcephalic fetuses to term? What possible justification under Republican dogma would exist for such an exception? How about women who can't afford the procedure? Are they going to be consigned to have babies with horrific birth defects, simply because they're not rich enough to pay? Or is Medicaid going to pay for the procedure? Who is going to perform it? And how do you expect women to react when they come up against the barriers you have imposed?These are all questions Republicans can fairly expect when they go out to meet the voters this fall. It will be interesting to hear their answers. ","dailykos","left","16837","zika",1911
"What can science and the government do to minimize the risk of future viruses like Zika? originally appeared on Quora - the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. Answer by Amy Pope, Deputy Homeland Security Advisor to President Obama, on Quora.This is an important question! And one that the President is consistently focused on because public investment in science and medical research can help ensure the innovative solution we need is found as quickly as possible. Regarding the Zika virus specifically, the President has directed his Administration to work aggressively and, earlier this year, asked Congress for approximately $1.9 billion in emergency funding to strengthen our ongoing efforts to prepare for and respond to the Zika virus, both at home and abroad. These additional resources are critical to meeting this challenge head on through some key strategies specific to this virus, including:And while it is imperative to respond immediately to Zika, if we want to minimize the risk of future epidemics, we need to fully implement the Global Health Security Agenda and maintain our investments in public health, medical research and access to care - both at home and around the world.

"Like everyone else who has heard the news about it, I find the rapid spread of the Zika virus extremely alarming. The newly recognized capacity of this virus, which historically has caused mild, self-limited infections in adults, to induce microcephaly, a terrible birth defect, is nothing less than devastating. To date, Brazil has borne the brunt of this development, with thousands of newborns affected. But the virus has now been identified in at least 20 countries in the Americas. As I write this, the World Health Organization is scrambling to catch up with the global proliferation of this emerging infectious disease, and poised to declare a public health emergency.As inevitably occurs when a new health threat emerges, this one is generating lots of media attention, with coverage in both the scientific literature and popular press. Predictably, much of that attention is specific to the Zika virus itself, with relatively less addressing the general circumstances that foster our vulnerability to such crises. Both topics matter.This particular virus was originally identified in Uganda some 70 years ago, first in monkeys, then in people. That likely makes it a zoonosis at the start, a disease transmitted to our species from another. The vector shuttling between the two was the Aedes mosquito, the bite of which transmits the virus. The first human who got Zika, in other words, was likely stung by a mosquito that had drawn blood from an infected monkey not long prior. For the past half century, Zika has generally been limited to Uganda and Tanzania, with isolated outbreaks seen occasionally in other parts of the world.That there is no specific treatment for Zika, named after the forest in Uganda where it was first identified, and no vaccine, is because until now the virus has not inspired much global concern, partly because it was not all that serious, and partly no doubt because it was ""over there.""Exactly why this infection, in the same family with the viruses that cause yellow fever and dengue fever, is suddenly implicated in an epidemic of birth defects is a work in progress. One likely explanation, for which there is evidence, is an evolutionary change in the virus itself. That may be compounded by exposure of new human populations, with perhaps different genetic vulnerabilities; transmission at a new scale; or other factors yet to be determined. We are currently on the steep part of the learning curve, racing to catch up with current events.That's a familiar race. We ran it for Ebola, too; and SARS, and MERS. Whatever the next outbreak is, we will likely need to run it again. We keep getting left behind.For now, practical advice about Zika is limited, and mostly of the ""easier said than done"" variety. Countries mired in the outbreak are advising against pregnancy. We are all encouraged to avoid mosquito bites. Travel advisories are being issued.As we confront Zika, but mostly fail to think beyond it, I am tempted to compare this predicament to its analogy in the space I work in all the time, nutrition. For decades, we have shifted from one nutrient fixation to the next- fat, carbohydrate, sugar, gluten -- and generally been left behind by the big picture. The result has been a flurry of misguided, mono-nutrient activity, and no meaningful improvement in our prevailing vulnerability to the marketing of junk food. We just keep encouraging the invention of new varieties of junk food, and reaping what we sow. At present, we have sown a bumper crop of gluten-free junk.The situation with emerging infections is much the same. We react to each as if the particular bug is the entire problem, while paying far less attention to fundamentals of public health practice and preparedness that account for vulnerability not just to the last outbreak and the current one, but the next. That same tendency -- the neglect of public health until we have cause to think about panic, outrage, or both -- is on display in Flint, Michigan as well.The implications of the Zika crisis are not confined to this particular pathogen, for there will be a next, and a next. I am reasonably confident that an acute concentration of resources and ingenuity on Zika will result in a vaccine. Welcome though that will be, perhaps even by some prone to misguided railing against vaccination, it will do nothing to resolve our basic vulnerability.As the climate changes, and we are past the point of debating the fact of it, the distribution of pathogens is changing too. We have seen this many times already, and are thus forewarned: we will be seeing it again. Whether or not we are forearmed depends on how we react, and allocate resources.There is, thankfully, ever more attention to how the more than 7 billion of us Homo sapiens are roughing up the planet's remaining pristine places. There is less, however, to the ramifications of it. For one thing, more people in more places inevitably means more encounters with bugs formerly unencountered. For another, the disruptions of ecosystems often circle back to bite us.Another issue, relevant to almost every major peril our species now faces, is the very fact that there are more than 7 billion of us, and rising fast. There aren't just humans in ever more places, there are ever more humans in ever greater concentrations everywhere. Whatever else we may be, we are just one, vast Petri dish to our pathogens. Plagues are a product of dense populations and unprecedented population densities will predictably mean new plagues.And then finally, there is our proclivity to disperse into our competing factions: nations, religions, political parties, and so on. The distinctions between ""us"" and ""them"" may matter enormously to us, and them, but to the Zika virus, we are all the same, accommodating species. From the bug's eye view, there is no ""over there."" In a world of increasing global travel, the bug is right.In our fantasies, we acknowledge that. The usual scenario is a science fiction adventure in which humanity is attacked by a scourge from without -- an extraterrestrial menace -- and that common threat provides common cause, and unifies us. We overcome our differences to defend our home, and our shared humanity.From what we know about the universe, the probability of extraterrestrial visitation, hostile or otherwise, seems vanishingly remote- for reasons entirely unrelated to the probability of life on other planets. If interested in the mind-boggling barriers to such inter-stellar concourse, I recommend Lawrence Krauss' book, A Universe from Nothing, as a good place to start.But the threats to us all, threats blind to the borders of nations, and deaf to the distinctions of ideology, are already here. They have no need to traverse the distance between stars.The faults we must overcome for our own security lie not with exotic perils from distant stars, but with dangers evolving right here at home. The faults lie most particularly with ourselves. Ironically, Zika is named after a forest, and one of our great liabilities is the recurrent failure to see the forest through the trees. We react to each new pathogen, while doing little to anticipate the next.We often fail as well to perceive and prioritize our common humanity. We rally to the defense of it when fighting the threats of science fiction fantasy, but miss the opportunity to do so in the face of real, clear, present, and inevitably recurrent danger.President, American College of Lifestyle MedicineFollow at: LinkedIN; Twitter; FacebookRead at: INfluencer Blog; Huffington Post; US News & World Report; About.com","huffingtonpost","left","16829","zika",1309
"When the Zika virus epidemic erupted in Brazil last year, public health officials took swift action because the virus was linked to an alarming birth defect: microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with very small heads and possible neurological damage. We know now that Zika virus infection, which is spread primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito, is a cause of microcephaly and other serious developmental defects, and has been linked to other problems, including miscarriages and stillbirth. While our attention is rightly focused on vaccine development, mosquito control, and other measures to prevent the spread of Zika, it is also important that we in the public health community identify optimal approaches to treat and care for the generation of children exposed to the virus in the womb.According to the World Health Organization, thousands of suspected Zika-associated cases of microcephaly have been reported in Brazil since October 2015, which is just one of more than 58 countries and territories reporting local, mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus. To provide optimal care and appropriate interventions for these children, we must first understand the long-term effects of fetal exposure to Zika virus. Our current information is limited because most suspected cases of Zika-related birth defects have involved pregnant women with symptomatic Zika virus infection, while the majority of Zika virus infections do not produce symptoms such as rash, fever, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). We need to know much more about the health outcomes for children born to women with asymptomatic Zika infections. Our understanding of Zika-related fetal complications also skews toward the more extreme and visible birth defects, such as microcephaly. However, a focus on head size may provide false reassurance to doctors and families because other brain abnormalities associated with Zika infection, such as ventriculomegaly (an enlargement of brain ventricles) and intracranial calcifications (calcium deposits in the brain tissue), may occur in children with normal-sized heads. These and similar conditions can be severe and have significant effects on a child's long-term development.Studies are underway to monitor pregnant women in regions where the virus is spreading--not only to discern the risk of adverse outcomes for a woman infected during her pregnancy (whether she has symptoms or not), but also to document the full spectrum of infant outcomes related to Zika virus exposure. For example, we need a better understanding of Zika virus-related eye and hearing abnormalities, as well as neurobehavioral effects such as altered motor function and stiffness. A new NIH-funded study in Zika-endemic areas of Latin America and the Caribbean will closely follow up to 10,000 pregnant women to determine if they become infected with the virus and, if so, what outcomes result for both mother and child. Researchers also will follow the infants, including those who show no signs or symptoms, for at least one year after birth to evaluate their developmental milestones. The CDC has also developed a registry for Zika-exposed women and infants in the United States. Data collected through these studies and systems will be used to inform pregnant women on the risks of Zika, to update recommendations for clinical care, and to improve efforts to prevent Zika infection during pregnancy. It is important to acknowledge that parents, families, caregivers, and health care professionals could be contending with these and other outcomes for many years to come. We know that children exposed to different infections in the womb are more susceptible to long-term health issues, such as developmental delays and learning disabilities. We learned much over the years on how to care for these children, but more research will be critical to address the specific of needs of children affected by Zika virus, so that we can provide optimal care and treatment and help them achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.","huffingtonpost","left","16973","zika",662
"The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and sometimes brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean, and with the high volume of news about the virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.Here are five updates, opinions and developments to know about now:  Pope Francis said Wednesday that using birth control to prevent a pregnancy is ""not an absolute evil,"" but he stopped short of condoning abortion, which he called ""a crime, an absolute evil."" The Catholic Church generally opposes contraception, but, like Francis, previous popes have suggested exceptions might be made for women in extraordinary danger of being raped (as was the case for nuns in Belgian Congo during the 1960s) or to prevent the spread of HIV.Several countries affected by Zika virus outbreaks have advised women to delay pregnancy if possible -- a difficult request in some areas where there is little access to birth control or in heavily Catholic areas that do not believe in contraception. World health authorities suspect that Zika virus may be the cause of severe birth defects, and a handful of reported cases in the U.S. suggest that the disease may be transmitted sexually. For this reason, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that recommend that pregnant couples use condoms correctly and consistently if either partner may have been exposed to to Zika virus.A new study published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases found Zika virus in the amniotic fluid of two pregnant women whose babies were born with the birth defect microcephaly, Reuters reports. Scientists say the study suggests that Zika can cross the placenta barrier and potentially infect a fetus. The women's urine and blood samples tested negative for the virus.""This study cannot determine whether the Zika virus identified in these two cases was the cause of microcephaly in the babies,"" said study author Ana de Filippis. ""Until we understand the biological mechanism linking Zika virus to microcephaly, we cannot be certain that one causes the other.""The Health Ministry of Brazil said that of the 508 recently confirmed cases of microcephaly in the country, the majority are probably linked to Zika, and that earlier microcephaly estimates had been too conservative, according to Reuters. There are currently 3,935 suspected cases of microcephaly being investigated in the country.A 61-year-old Trinidad and Tobago woman was diagnosed with Zika after a blood test, the country reported Wendesday. Although the patient traveled internationally in January, her trip was to New Zealand, a Zika-free zone, leading health experts to suspect that her infection was acquired locally. If confirmed, it will be the first locally acquired case of the virus in the island nation, Reuters reports.The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is the primary vector for both Zika virus and dengue, is wrecking havoc in Argentina. Nearly 4,900 cases of dengue -- a tropical virus which causes nausea, fever, severe pain, and in rare cases, death -- have been reported in the first five weeks of 2016. Experts fear the actual number of cases could be 10 times as high as reported, according to the New York Times.While Argentina has only had a handful of travel-related Zika cases this year, health experts fear that the thriving Aedes aegypti mosquito population, combined with standing water in urban areas, could be setting the stage for the virus. ""I think the conditions are there for Zika outbreaks,"" Jorge Osorio, a professor of pathobiological science at the University of Wisconsin told the New York Times. ""We have a mosquito population and we have people traveling from Argentina to Brazil."" The countries and territories under travel alert by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are: American Samoa, Aruba, Barbados, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Samoa, Suriname, Tonga, Venezuela and the U.S. Virgin Islands. ","huffingtonpost","left","16849","zika",865
"Responsible for grave birth defects, scientists are scambling to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus tearing across Latin America. According to a new study published in Nature, there are two specific Dengue fever antibodies that can neutralize the virus. Yet, most Dengue antibodies can in fact excerbate the virus. As Dengue fever tends to affect 90% of areas battling against Zika, these findings suggest that a future vaccine could potentially safeguard against both viruses. Over 15 companies are currently locked in a race to develop a drug, and US group Invovio is the first out of the blocks to begin human trials for its offering. After getting the green light from the U.S. Food and Drug administration, the Philadelphia based firm will begin testing on 40 healthy adults in the coming weeks. The vaccine has already been tested on large and medium sized animals. The experimental drug called GLS-5700, uses man made fragments of the virus to stimulate an immune response in the body. Researchers will probably require several trials to prove its efficacy and safety. Although most Zika victims experience mild to no symptoms, the virus spread by the Aedes mosquito wreaks havoc in an unborn baby. Earlier this year, the virus started to dominate headlines after Brazil reported a surge in microcephaly: an uncommon birth defect where babies are born with abnormally small heads and severe development issues. In February, the World Health Organization declared Zika a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. And by June, over 1,500 cases were reported.Although the condition was initially blamed on a wide variety of factors from genetically modified mosquitos to larvacide in drinking water, by April the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that Zika is in fact spread by an infected Aedes mosquito. It has now been linked to a vast array of neurological problems and can affect the fetus at any point during a woman'spregnancy. 'Always, the first vaccine to go into clinical trial is important. It means the FDA has reviewed it, and I'm sure is formulating questions and getting ready for additional candidates to submit their investigational drug applications. It shows progress and momentum, and we just need to keep momentum going,' says Anna Durbin, an associate professor of international health at Johns Hopkins. But, even if Inovio is able to make an effective vaccine, it is unlikely to get to market anytime soon. According to Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine: ""What is not really being said is that once phase one trials are completed, it is likely that progress towards licensure will slow significantly. The FDA or other regulatory bodies will need to see trials to ensure that the vaccine does not induce Guillain-Barré syndrome, as does the Zika virus itself. Since the vaccine would likely be needed for pregnant women or women who are about to become pregnant, the FDA will want to see extensive safety data in these populations."" According to Karen Kotloff who serves on the FDA's vaccines and related biological products advisory committee:""The average time to take a vaccine from the laboratory bench to somebody's arm is about 10 to 15 years, and there is a wide range on that, so it can be substantially longer.""Last month, the WHO rejected calls for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games to be moved or postponed because of the threat of a large zika outbreak in Brazil. The move came after 100 leading scientists called on the global health body to act. They argued that it was ""unethical"" for the games to proceed given that the virus may then spread globally and affect countless other babies:'The fire is already burning, but that is not a rationale not to do anything about the Olympics,"" said Amir Attaran, a professor at the University of Ottawa who is one of the letter's authors. ""It is not the time now to throw more gasoline on to the fire.'But, according to the WHO, the Olympics will ""not significantly alter"" the spread of Zika as it will be held during the winter months when the mosquito responsible for spreading the virus is less active: ""Based on the current assessment of Zika virus circulating in almost 60 countries globally and 39 in the Americas, there is no public health justification for postponing or cancelling the games,"" the WHO said in a statement.But, the UN health body does advise pregnant women to not travel to the games. Rickie Fowler has become the latest high-profile golfer to cast doubt on his participation in the Olympic Games owing to Zika. He joins Cyclist Tejay van Garderen  who has withdrawn over his concern that the virus could pose a risk to his pregnant wife.","huffingtonpost","left","16975","zika",812
"Williamson County confirmed its first case of the Zika virus on Tuesday. The person was infected when they traveled to a country plagued by the virus. A traveled-related Zika virus case in Collin County was also reported on Monday.Deb Stahler of the Williamson County and Cities Health District confirmed the Zika virus case, and the fact that the person had recently traveled outside of the U.S. to the infested country, reported the Austin American Statesman.Stahler also said the focus is still on the West Nile virus and the chance of getting infecting with the Zika virus is extremely low. She told the Statesman, ""We're still focusing on the West Nile virus. It's operations as usual here  but we want people to make sure they're protecting themselves.""The Austin newspaper said that the first case of the Zika virus in Travis County (Austin) was reported in February. The 50-year-old man had traveled to Columbia. Also reported in February was the story about a woman who had traveled to Columbia who had contacted the virus when she was there.On Monday, The Dallas Morning News reported that a Frisco woman who traveled outside of the U.S. had also tested positive for the Zika virus. It reported that Dallas County has had six confirmed cases this year and Denton County, located in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, has had two confirmed cases.Breitbart Texas reported in February that the number of cases in the Lone Star State had reached up to thirteen confirmed cases, including one in Dallas County and two in Bexar County.A pregnant woman in Houston who is from El Salvador, tested positive for the Zika virus in late April, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The Zika virus is prolific in El Salvador. The woman came to Houston from the country earlier this year. A representative from the center where she was receiving care said it is unknown whether the woman contacted the virus through a bite from a mosquito or sexual contact.Zika is a virus spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and it has also been spread through sexual contact. Dallas County health officials confirmed its first sexually-transmitted Zika virus in early February, as reported by Breitbart Texas.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has concluded that the virus is a great threat to pregnant women because it is ""a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects."" The CDC has issued warnings to pregnant women telling them to avoid traveling to Zika affected countries.Those who have visited one of the countries that have been affected by the Zika virus should see their doctor if they have a fever or aches when they return to the states.Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

"Evidence that the Zika virus causes serious birth defects is growing stronger by the day, the head of the Centers for Disease Control said Thursday as he lobbied Congress to approve President Obama's $1.8 billion request to the fight the rapidly spreading disease at home and abroad.Testifying before the Senate Appropriations Committee, CDC Director Tom Frieden cited studies in which scientists discovered Zika's genome in the brains of an aborted fetus in Brazil and babies who died within 24 hours of being born.Each of them had abnormally small heads, or microcephaly - a condition that's been linked to Zika, elevating the stakes around a virus that appears to cause at most only mild symptoms in adults, such as minior fevers, rashes or red-eye.""It's looking increasingly certain, though not yet proven, that it is causal,"" Dr. Frieden told the Senate Appropriations Committee.The CDC and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the infectious diseases director at the National Institutes of Health, pleaded with lawmakers to authorize Mr. Obama's request for emergency funds, saying the Zika threat requires a multi-pronged approach that destroys mosquito populations while seeking a vaccine and more reliable tests for the virus.Dr. Frieden said there may already be a shortage of kits for a current test which, while imprecise, can detect Zika in people who no longer show symptoms.House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said he is ready to address Zika in bipartisan fashion, but that Congress would need to ""scrub"" Mr. Obama's emergency request once it gets it.Others said the agency already has funds in the near term, so there is no reason to send a massive amount of taxpayer dollars out the door this week.""We don't want to get the cart before the horse,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander, Tennessee Republican, said in a brief interview. ""To the credit of the CDC they're moving rapidly, and I appreciate that. Number two, we should carefully evaluate their proposal and make sure the money is being spent for the right thing, and that we're spending money effectively.""Sen. Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican and chairman of the Appropriations Committee's panel on health, said there appeared to be money left over from the anti-Ebola campaign to fight Zika - an idea that Dr. Frieden rejected.""Those dollars are fully committed,"" he said.Down the hall, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said workers who have been swabbing the dead in Sierra Leone uncovered a new Ebola case in recent weeks, even though the country had been declared Ebola-free.""We need to make sure we finish the job on Ebola,"" she told the Senate Finance Committee.Though Zika isn't actively transmitting in the U.S., travelers have brought the virus back with them and there has been a documented case of sexual transmission in Texas. And as temperatures rise in the summer, the U.S. will be at greater risk of transmission from mosquitoes - particularly in the southern states.The U.S. is advising pregnant women to defer visits to the affected countries, which are in the Caribbean and Latin America, or to at least take precautions against mosquito bites if they must travel. Dr. Frieden said the issue is particularly urgent in Puerto Rico, where transmission is active.Senate Democrats urged the GOP-led Congress to move quickly to approve money.""I am going to plead with them to not just talk the talk, but walk the walk,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, New York Democrat. ","washingtontimes","right","16842","zika",583
"The 69th World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva demonstrated once again the central role of the World Health Organization (WHO) in global health. Whether one focuses on WHO's global action plan on antimicrobial resistance or the international response to health emergencies like the Ebola and Zika viruses, there were countless venues for official and unofficial decisions and discussions on every health issue under the sun.One of the unique benefits of discussions during the annual Assembly that one does not get in other hubs of public health is the depth of influence and expertise, from absolutely every corner of the globe, present at WHA in Geneva. With 194 Member States, WHO is able to bring together cabinet ministers for health, senior officials, and multitudes of experts from governments in addition to health leaders and staff from nongovernmental organizations, academic institutions, the media, and the private sector. The annual gathering plays a pivotal role in establishing the global health agenda.At this WHA, which took place May 23-28, there was strong support for the reform of WHO's work in health emergency management. The new health emergencies program represents a fundamental development that complements WHO's traditional technical and normative roles with new operational capabilities for work in outbreaks and humanitarian emergencies. The new program is designed to bring speed and predictability to WHO's emergency work, using an all-hazards approach, promoting collective action, and encompassing preparedness, readiness, response, and early recovery activities. That requires money, and the Assembly agreed to increase the 2016-2017 budget by $160 million through voluntary contributions (some of which already have been pledged).The Ebola crisis in West Africa made it clear that countries need to greatly enhance their capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. The globally accepted, fundamental framework to improve global health security is WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR). Member States supported a new, voluntary tool for objective, external evaluations of IHR implementation, and there is now an alliance of governments and nongovernmental organizations supporting the process so that countries will be able to establish prioritized plans to improve their capabilities. Coupled with other efforts, such as WHO's Contingency Fund for Emergencies and the new Pandemic Emergency Facility led by the World Bank, the effort to improve global health security is making significant progress - with much, much more to be done. It is also clear that there now is much greater recognition that health efforts must fit into broader, multi-sectoral, multi-stakeholder approaches. This was the first WHA since UN Member States approved the Sustainable Development Goals, and the role of the health sector in achieving these goals and targets - along with the need to employ a holistic approach that breaks down institutional silos - was an underlying theme throughout the week. Featured speaker Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, highlighted the linkages between health and climate change.Every WHA has a few particularly contentious issues that require extended negotiations, and this was no exception. After years of negotiations, agreement was finally reached on a framework for WHO to engage with non-state actors that is intended to avoid conflicts of interest while allowing WHO to work with many other institutions. A resolution on nutrition and guidance on the promotion of foods for infants and young children generated controversy, in part because of process and technical issues, but compromise language was accepted in the end.Next year's Assembly will select a new WHO Director-General to succeed Dr. Margaret Chan, and this WHA took steps to increase transparency around the upcoming election. These include webcasting live, in all official languages, the candidates' forum planned for November 2016.The explosive growth of global health programs over the last two decades has seen a concomitant growth in interest in WHA, and longtime attendees marvel at the increase in participation by NGOs and others. In a frenzy of networking, some 3,500 people converged on the UN's Palais des Nations for this year's Assembly. This was my 10th consecutive Assembly, and I have witnessed the range of issues at official and unofficial events during WHA week continue to expand - and the global health agenda has expanded accordingly.","huffingtonpost","left","16955","zika",709
"Katie McGinty (D. PA)Katie McGinty (D. PA) is hitting Tea Party U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R. PA) and GOP Presidential nominee, Donald Trump, on two key issues. First, there's Toomey on this issue:McGinty held a phone conference criticizing GOP Senator Pat Toomey for his previous votes against bills that would have provided funding to fight the spread of zika, and for his support of a recent bill that would provide zika funding, while slashing support for the Affordable Care Act. The former State Secretary of Environmental Protection says lawmakers have the ability to ward off zika, before it spreads in the state like West Nile Virus.""But we can't do it with a lot of hot air and a lot of rhetoric,"" the Democrat nominee for U.S. Senate said. ""What we need to do is provide the resources so that the experts can take action.""McGinty partnered with Patricia Aiken of the PA Association of Staff Nurses to underscore the medical community's concern about funding zika efforts.And when it comes to Trump, McGinty published an op-ed piece in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on this issue:Donald Trump thundered into Western Pennsylvania last week<U+200E> and, as usual, he mostly made a lot of noise.But I tuned in since he was talking about trade, and we do need to change course on bad trade deals if we are going to address our most urgent need: rebuilding the middle class with family-sustaining jobs.Most of Mr. Trump's speech was nonsense. Anyone who thinks the problem in America is that people make too much money or that women just need to work harder if they expect equal pay is not in touch with how hard people already work and how stagnant incomes have been.Mr. Trump focused on two issues that have helped him make millions: trade deals and putting Chinese profits ahead of American jobs.Here in Pennsylvania, we have seen firsthand the negative impact of bad trade deals. Factories have been shut down. Thousands of jobs have been lost.The Trans-Pacific Partnership would only make things worse. Independent experts say the TPP likely would eliminate some 50,000 good jobs every year in the United States, mostly in manufacturing.We also cannot continue enabling China to get ahead unfairly at the expense of American workers. Pennsylvania has lost more than 120,000 jobs to China just since 2001 because we've allowed China to play by its own rules, manipulating its currency and dumping its steel and other products into our markets.I strongly encourage you to read the whole op-ed because she goes into detail about how she wants to stand up for the American worker. On Toomey's end, he's avoiding running on fiscal and economic issues this time around and instead focused on this:In a letter to the White House last week, Toomey urged the president to rescind an executive order that blocked transfers of surplus high-caliber military equipment to local law enforcement.""You have continued to restrict local police access to armored vehicles, explosives, protective helmets, and other lifesaving, federal equipment,"" Toomey wrote to Obama. ""Specifically, you have restricted local police departments from using federal funds for these items.""Toomey cited the BearCat vehicle that saved lives while the Orlando attacker was taking hostages inside the nightclub in order to bolster his argument that police departments need access to this type of equipment.The letter has led to accusations from his political opponents of political posturing at best and at worst attempting to take advantage of the shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando to get re-elected.It doesn't help that Toomey-who is positioning himself as a security hawk-once voted for an amendment that would have scrapped the very program he claims to be championing.But that was before he was in the race of his career.The Pennsylvania Republican and former chairman of the conservative Club for Growth rode the 2010 wave of conservatives elected to Congress while largely billing himself as a fiscal and budget hawk.While in some areas he has sought to strike the middle ground-such as with gun control-Toomey has recently taken a harder line and tone on law and order. In March, he introduced a bill, the Lifesaving Gear for Police Act, that would fully reinstate the program that allowed the military to give their surplus weaponry to police departments.President Obama signed an executive order last May to limit the so-called 1033 program-which allows the Department of Defense to liquidate its surplus military equipment and transfer it to local law enforcement-after the shooting death of a young black man by police in Ferguson, Missouri, ignited clashes between police and protesters.At the time, police were accused of utilizing weaponry that was more suited for the streets of a war zone than of a U.S. suburb.In his letter, Toomey argued that after Orlando, the program should be fully reinstated, and that items such as bayonets and weaponized aircraft should be sent to local police units with few restrictions.I'm also glad that Toomey is getting called out on his silence for gun control after 2013:His work on gun laws has come under scrutiny since the Orlando shooting and has figured prominently in his tough reelection battle, a race that could help determine control of the Senate. While he has touted his background-checks bill as a sign of willingness to work across the aisle, his challenger, Katie McGinty, has accused him of political posturing, and she and other Democrats scoff that his efforts have failed to bring other Republicans on board.Some gun-control advocates who hailed Toomey's 2013 bill have been dismayed by his recent votes.In December and June, he opposed Democratic proposals to close the so-called terror gap that allows suspected terrorists to clear background checks. He also helped block a Democratic background-check bill. Instead, Toomey voted for GOP proposals backed by the National Rifle Association.He also drew up his own plan on the terror gap and was one of eight Republicans to support a compromise offered by Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) last month, but neither gained traction.""It's a little bit of mixed messages. Does he want to solve the problem? Does he want to be a bipartisan deal-maker? Is this a top priority for him?"" asked Shira Goodman, executive director of CeaseFirePA, which praised Toomey's background-check effort with Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) in 2013.With Republicans holding the Senate, she said, Toomey should be pushing his colleagues to act: ""Putting his name on Manchin-Toomey was a great first step, but there's more we can do.""Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that while Toomey was ""there at a time that we really needed him"" on background checks, he was ""not off the hook.""But Toomey continues to paint himself as Mr. Tough On Crime through Donald Trump-style fear mongering:Six years later, the Pennsylvania senator is locked in one of the tightest reelection races in the country. And with fiscal issues taking a back seat to immigration and terrorism in the year of Donald Trump, Toomey is tweaking his message to fit the mood.His revised profile takes center stage on Wednesday, when the Senate is set to vote on legislation authored by the first-term senator that would strip some federal funds from cities and counties that don't cooperate with federal immigration officials.Sanctuary cities - an issue, like many other immigration policies, that is rife with contentious politics - burst into the national spotlight with the death of 32-year-old Kate Steinle last July by an immigrant in the United States illegally who had been deported several times but returned each time.Through Senate speeches, a radio ad and now, getting his own bill on the floor for a vote, Toomey has seized on sanctuary cities. It's a key part of his broader effort to paint Democratic challenger Katie McGinty as lax on crime in one of this year's most competitive Senate races.We can't allow Toomey to scare his way back into the Senate.

"The World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern, or PHAIC, on Monday in response to the clusters of microcephaly and neurological abnormalities linked to Zika virus.Zika, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and brains that aren't fully developed, resulting in life-long developmental problems.   With the high volume of news about the Zika virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps. Here's the latest information you should know as of Monday afternoon:As noted above, the WHO just officially declared a PHAIC around Zika -- a rare designation that's only been applied to three other public health emergencies: the H1N1 swine flu outbreak of 2009, a resurgence of polio in 2014, and the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Officials hope the designation will help mobilize and international response effort to fight the virus.An estimated 1 million illegal abortions already occur in Brazil every year, a number that experts expect to increase amidst fears of about microcephaly, which is likely linked to Zika virus. Unsafe abortions are a serious public health concern and account for between 8 and 15 percent of maternal deaths in developing countries, making them the leading cause of maternal mortality.Researchers and activists plan to petition Brazil's supreme court to allow a Zika virus exception to the country's strict abortion laws. If the Supreme Court doesn't act, ""we will soon have a generation of poor women whose destiny will be to look after extremely dependent children full-time,"" Debora Diniz, a law professor and activist, told Reuters.Colombia, which borders Brazil, reported 20,297 cases of Zika virus in the country, almost half of which occurred in the nation's Caribbean region. Of those cases, 2,116 were in pregnant women, according to Reuters. So far, there are no reported cases of microcephaly or deaths related to Zika virus.While Colombia has strict abortion laws, officials say that Zika virus will qualify as an exception to restrictions. Still, access to abortion providers is limited, especially in rural areas of the country.  ""Some of the mothers hope the microcephaly is something that will pass, and just have an empty gaze when I tell them it will not,"" Dr. Angela Rocha, head of the infant care unit at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Recife, Brazil, an area that's been hit particularly hard by Zika virus, told the New York Times. ""Others simply start to cry when the reality sets in.""Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff authorized a measure allowing health officials to enter any property in the country, by force if necessary, in an effort to eradicate breeding ground for the Zika-carrying mosquito. So far, the country has deployed 220,000 troops to fight the mosquito Aedes aegypti.As wealthy Brazilian women get pregnant, they are increasingly flying to Europe to avoid Zika virus, the Associated Press reports. That's not an option for low-income pregnant women, many of whom can't even afford mosquito repellant, which has tripled or quadrupled in price since the outbreak -- when it's available at all.According to research by NPR, DEET repellents are still the recommended formula for keeping mosquitos at bay. Products containing picaridin and IR 3535 are also highly effective, and experts recommend wearing loose, long clothing and staying indoors during mid-mornings and early evenings, when mosquitos are particularly active.","huffingtonpost","left","16832","zika",705
"Colombian health officials announced a ""probable"" microcephaly case in an aborted fetus and discovered the Zika virus in the amniotic fluid.An 18-year-old girl aborted the baby at 28 weeks in Popayan, located in Cauca. The doctors saw the baby had ""an abnormally small head and considered it microcephaly."" The National Health Institute did not examine the baby since doctors threw away the body.""Unfortunately in this case, the breach of guidelines by those responsible for handling the case in Cauca prevented an accurate diagnosis being reached,"" explained director Martha Lucia Ospina. ""They discarded the fetal remains that were indispensable to diagnose or rule out Zika and the link with microcephaly and other abnormalities.""The Zika outbreak reached Colombia in October 2015. The country has recorded 37,000 Zika cases, among them 6,300 pregnant women. Doctors ""confirmed the presence of Zika in 522 of those cases."" Unlike Brazil, Colombia has not linked any babies with microcephaly to Zika, even though Colombia has the second-largest number of Zika cases.Microcephaly occurs when the brain does not form properly during pregnancy or after birth, causing a small head. Children can suffer from seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems. Doctors cannot diagnose microcephaly until the third trimester or after birth:Virologist Gubio Soares, who first identified the pervasive Zika virus in Brazil, suggested that legalized abortion in French Polynesia may have prevented scientists from uncovering a link between Zika and severe infant deformities sooner. During a lecture, Soares claimed scientists do not know for sure if a link exists between Zika and microcephaly. This is mainly because women in places where Zika breeds often aborted children who showed signs of microcephaly.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced that doctors had confirmed the Zika virus in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly. ""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC Director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of claiming Zika caused the microcephaly. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.In Brazil, Dr. Sandra Mattos found data on 100,000 newborns since 2012. At least 1,600 babies born in the last years had microcephaly or smaller-than-normal heads. ""We were very, very surprised,"" stated Mattos. ""Borderline cases seem to be present all along.""CBC News reports:Mattos told the World Health Organization that ""other potential factors need to be considered"" since 80% of the microcephaly babies live in northeast Brazil.","breitbart","right","16856","zika",426
"An African virus that historically rarely infected people is spreading in the Americas, apparently causing the babies of infected mothers to be born with deformed heads. The Zika virus is carried by mosquitoes and spreads when the insects bite. And though it appeared in the Americas just nine months ago in the Easter Islands off Chile, the World Health Organization said it will soon spread to almost all countries in the Americas, including to the United States.In 2014, Brazilian health officials reported 147 cases of babies born with shrunken skulls: it was microcephaly, a congenital deformation of the skull that compresses the infants' brains. In 2015, the number jumped to nearly 4,000 microcephaly cases reported in the country.The correlation between the 2015 explosion in microcephaly cases in Brazil and 19 other countries in the Americas and the spread of the Zika virus is so strong that many public health leaders accept the hypothesis that maternal infection with the mosquito-carried virus during pregnancy causes the skull deformations. Zika virus genetic material has been found in the amniotic fluids of mothers delivering microcephaly babies, and autopsies of two babies that died of the ailment discovered Zika viruses in their brains. Though the Zika virus has recently appeared in the U.S., no cases were acquired in the country and no infected mosquitoes have been found in the 50 states. But the infected insects lurk nearby: locally acquired Zika cases have emerged in Puerto Rico and Mexico. A growing number of European countries have also reported Zika infections among travelers returning from Central and South America. The United Kingdom has reportedly identified three new cases; Spain, two; and Portugal, four. In Colombia, at least 13,500 Zika cases have been identified. Far to the north, Puerto Rico has found 19 cases on the island.There is little immediate concern that the virus will spread across the U.S. because mosquitoes are dormant during winter, and this year's winter weather has been harsh, even in the southernmost parts of the continental U.S. However, as temperatures rise and spring rains create potential breeding sites, there is genuine cause for concern.  Other than the spread from mother to fetus in utero and two sexually transmitted cases via contaminated semen, there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission of the Zika virus. To be infected, a person must have been bitten by a feeding mosquito or hypothetically, receive a contaminated blood transfusion. Once infected, the individual's immune system determines whether the illness is so mild as to go unnoticed or more severe.There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika, and the skull malformations in infected babies cannot be reversed. Nevertheless, most Zika fever cases are mild enough to be confused with the flu or a bad cold and rarely merit hospitalization. In countries such as Brazil, where the other rapidly spreading mosquito-carried viruses -- dengue and chikungunya -- are found, the flu-like symptoms are so similar that blood tests are needed to distinguish the causes. All of these pathogens cause headaches, fevers, joint aches, malaise, weakness and nausea in milder cases. In very rare cases, Zika can cause the neurological disorder known as Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can be permanently debilitating. In addition to rising microcephaly rates in Brazil, Colombia and at least a dozen other countries in the hemisphere, there are new reports of rising numbers of Guillain-Barré syndrome cases. Both Zika and chikungunya can cause the syndrome. In 1978, a handful of Zika cases were identified in Indonesia, but the disease seemed to disappear without any public health intervention. The first serious outbreak of Zika outside of Africa occurred in April 2007 on Yap Island, part of Micronesia, eventually spreading to neighboring islands of the nation. Since the Yap outbreak, Zika has emerged eastward across the Pacific in the Cook Islands, Tahiti and, last year, the Easter Islands off Chile. Until 2015, Zika had never been seen in the Americas. For unknown biological reasons, Zika appears to follow the emergence of chikungunya, which in turn follows a new spread of dengue.In the unfortunate case of the Americas in 2015-16, a perfect storm of biological events has unfolded -- any one of which by itself would have been relatively harmless. These events include the introduction of Asian and African mosquitoes, the spread of yellow fever and then dengue, followed by chikungunya and now Zika; the El Niño climate event; and a Brazilian crisis in both economics and politics. Combined, these have fueled an explosive spread of the disease, and at least 20 countries have severe enough outbreaks to warrant public health emergencies and travel advisories from the CDC.Researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, David Morens and Anthony Fauci, warn that another, highly aggressive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, is found all over the Americas today. Were the tiger mosquito to take up the Zika virus, as aegypti did, the spread of the disease could reach far greater proportions.In the absence of vaccines or treatments for the three diseases, public health officials are taking drastic steps to slow the epidemics. The CDC this week issued a warning to American women of childbearing age, suggesting they not travel to countries that have Zika. The Brazilian government has warned women to avoid getting pregnant until the outbreak is controlled.Perhaps the most extreme government action comes from El Salvador, which strongly advises women to delay pregnancy until 2018 due to Zika risks. Since 1998, it has been illegal to obtain an abortion in El Salvador, even in cases of rape, incest and danger to the mother's life, prompting women's health advocates to insist the law be revoked in cases of Zika infection. Under El Salvador's laws, women are imprisoned for two to eight years if they undergo an abortion, terminated pregnancies are investigated for possible murder prosecution and health professionals that perform abortions face eight to 12 years of imprisonment.For Brazil, the Zika crisis comes as the country is spiraling into economic and political disorder, the president faces threatened impeachment and the nation hopes to impress the world as host of the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Desperate times call for desperate measures: the government is now considering the release of genetically modified aegypti mosquitoes that die before reaching adult stage.It is summertime in Brazil, with Carnival season not far off. Perhaps the country's greatest hope is that the chill of winter in June will drive the mosquitoes into dormancy during the July Olympics. The Brazilian government is concerned that the billions of dollars worth of tourism expected for the Olympics will be erased by a global Zika panic. Some three million travel agencies worldwide have received letters from Rio, promising that there would be no Zika threat during the games, thanks to aggressive mosquito control efforts. And the Ministry of Sports issued a memo that noted the Olympics commence on Aug. 5, in the middle of Brazil's winter when the mosquitoes are rarely seen and when ""only a minor incidence of cases of dengue"" is found nationwide.Brazil's premiere scientific research agency, Fiocruz, has done pivotal work in their laboratories that is guiding the government's response to Zika. On Jan. 16, for example, Fiocruz announced development of a rapid diagnostic test that can discriminate between dengue, chikungunya and Zika, greatly reducing confusion. The Brazilian lab also developed two tools -- one genetic, the other based on antibodies -- that allow researchers to find the Zika virus in blood and tissues. With these new methods, the lab found Zika in the semen of two infected men, suggesting the virus might be sexually transmitted, and in the wombs of pregnant women who gave birth to babies with microcephaly -- and in the skulls of those babies.Inspectors have scoured 7.4 million homes in search of urban breeding sites for the mosquitoes. On top on that, on Tuesday, Brazil's Minister of Health Marcelo Castro announced that 220,000 soldiers from the Brazilian Armed Forces were deployed across the country in search of mosquito breeding sites. But Castro offered little hope for the nation, warning that, ""The [Aeds aegypti]  mosquito has been here in Brazil for three decades, and we are badly losing the battle against the mosquito.""The final word goes to Morens and Fauci:In our human-dominated world, urban crowding, constant international travel and other human behaviors combined with human-caused microperturbations in ecologic balance can cause innumerable slumbering infectious agents to emerge unexpectedly. In response, we clearly need to up our game with broad and integrated research that expands understanding of the complex ecosystems in which agents of future pandemics are aggressively evolving.","huffingtonpost","left","16827","zika",1452
"The number of people infected with Zika in Puerto Rico is rising at an alarming rate, putting pregnant women at even greater risk of their babies suffering severe birth defects, a top U.S. public health official said Friday.The latest data show that the most accurate, real-time indicator of Zika infection suggests that thousands of pregnant women there could contract the virus in the coming months. That, in turn, could lead to ""dozens to hundreds of infants born with microcephaly in the coming year,"" Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a media briefing.Read more on Chicago Tribune","huffingtonpost","left","16973","zika",124
"WASHINGTON -- The Senate added emergency Zika funding to a larger spending bill Thursday, all but guaranteeing it will go nowhere soon.The Senate voted earlier to waive budget rules and add the cost of the $1.1 billion Zika measure to the deficit. It then passed it, 89-8, along with a massive appropriations measure that includes funding for transportation programs, the VA, housing programs and military construction.The passage sets up an immediate conflict with the House, which passed its own standalone Zika measure Wednesday with just $622 million in funding.The House has just begun to work on its spending bills, and so far there is no proposal to pass a measure similar to the Senate's. The lack of equivalent bills means GOP leaders will have to decide on a path forward. That could prove difficult, considering the wide differences in the competing bills.President Barack Obama had asked for $1.9 billion in February. Rather than act on his request, Republican leaders advised him to raid unspent money passed two years ago to combat Ebola. The administration did so, transferring $589 million into the Zika effort. Its $1.9 billion request would replace those funds.The House bill, however, relies on cutting Ebola funds further to offset its cost.The House could pass an appropriations bill that resembles the Senate's, but even if it does, it would require the two bodies to work out the differences.Another possibility would be for the Senate to take up the House bill, and amend it with its own provisions. But unless the leaders work out their differences, the modified version would likely fail in the House.Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 544 people in mainland U.S. states and Hawaii are infected with the virus, which can cause severe birth defects, among other ailments. There were also more than 800 cases in U.S. territories, primarily Puerto Rico. The infections are all believed to have been contracted abroad or in Puerto Rico, but doctors warn it is only a matter of time before people begin contracting the virus in the U.S. mainland and in Europe.","huffingtonpost","left","16940","zika",363

"Florida Gov. Rick Scott urged Congress Wednesday to brush partisanship aside and treat the looming Zika virus ""like a hurricane,"" saying his state is depending on resources and specific planning to gird for the mosquito-borne illness linked to serious birth defects and other health problems.Mr. Scott, a Republican, said he will meet with congressional leaders in Washington on May 11 and 12 to press for a clear plan in case the illness begins to spread on its own in Gulf Coast states like his, or the rest of the U.S. mainland.Florida has recorded more than 100 travel-related cases of Zika, and health officials warn that the disease could puncture the states further once temperatures climb and mosquito populations flourish.""We don't yet know for certain what will happen with this virus, but we owe our citizens a vigorous and thorough preparation effort at the federal level to best protect their health,"" Mr. Scott said. ""Congress and the Obama administration have discussed different plans to combat the Zika virus, some with different price tags. While there is no doubt that Washington wastes money on many things, that vast history of wrongful spending should not stop the federal government from doing the right thing now by executing a robust plan to prevent and combat the spread of Zika in America.""President Obama has urged Congress to approve his $1.9 billion request for emergency spending to combat Zika and backfill $510 million in Ebola funding that he has shifted to the burgeoning threat.Yet Republican leaders say the Ebola funding should cover immediate costs and that additional money could be disbursed through this year's appropriations process. Last week, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, Texas Republican, said he doesn't want to give the administration a ""blank check"" to fight Zika, while House conservatives have demanded that any additional spending be offset by budget cuts elsewhere.Mr. Scott didn't suggest a dollar amount in his statement Thursday, though he is adding his voice to Florida Republicans who want Congress to do something before Zika hits. The Sunshine State is relatively warm and has significant populations of Zika's primary vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito.Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, has urged fellow lawmakers to approve Mr. Obama's funding request as long as it's used solely to combat Zika.Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican whose district includes coastal communities south of Tampa, issued his call for complete funding Monday.""Zika's shadow is spreading too quickly in Florida, which has one-quarter of all the Zika cases in the United States,"" Mr. Buchanan said. ""The rest of the country should keep in mind that summer is coming and so are the mosquitoes. Congress needs to act quickly."" ","washingtontimes","right","16925","zika",451
"In October 2015, Brazilian health authorities notified the World Health Organization that an alarming number of Brazilian babies had been born with microcephaly, a rare, debilitating birth defect with lifelong consequences.Researchers quickly linked the spike in birth defects to the outbreak of a little-known tropical disease called Zika virus, which is transmitted by mosquito.Since its discovery in Uganda in 1947, Zika virus has popped up in different African and Asian countries, but no widespread outbreaks had occurred until 2013, when the virus infected an estimated 11 percent of the population of French Polynesia and spread to neighboring Pacific islands.Then, in 2014, Brazil hosted a series of international sporting events -- the FIFA World Cup and the Va'a World Elite & Club Sprint Championships canoe race. Researchers suspect that this is when people from the Pacific islands who were infected with Zika virus first introduced it to South America. Since then, the virus has spread across South and Central America, as well as the Caribbean -- reaching as far as the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.So far, two people have tested positive for the virus in Spain, three in the U.K. and approximately a dozen people in the U.S. since 2015. The virus has also been linked to a microcephalic baby born in Hawaii.However, it's important to note that the U.S. and European cases of the virus were acquired by travelers who had recently visited areas already affected by Zika. The virus has not necessarily reached the places where these people were diagnosed.Here's what you need to know about the virus and where it has traveled.As of Feb. 23, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have graded 34 countries and territories with a ""Level 2"" travel health warning because of reports of local Zika virus transmission. This means travelers should be extra vigilant to protect themselves from mosquito bites and prevent Zika.The countries and territories are: American Samoa, Aruba, Barbados, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Samoa, Suriname, the Marshall Islands, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela and the U.S. Virgin Islands.The CDC warning, issued Friday morning, advises pregnant women in any trimester to avoid traveling to these areas, if possible. Women who want to become pregnant should also first consult with a health care provider before going.If travel is unavoidable, the CDC says, pregnant women and women who want to become pregnant should follow the strictest protocols to guard against mosquito bites. This means using products with active ingredients like DEET or picaridin on exposed skin. (The CDC says these products are considered safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women.)The agency also advises wearing long sleeves and pants and sleeping in air-conditioned, screened-in rooms.Zika virus started popping up across Africa and in some Asian countries in the decades after it was discovered. However, because the virus' symptoms seemed relatively mild -- temporary fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes -- it wasn't considered much of a threat compared to other mosquito-borne diseases.That started to change in 2007, when Zika virus broke out in Yap, an island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It was the first time the virus had been found outside the African or Asian continents, researcher Edward Hayes noted at the time. While the symptoms were again relatively mild, Hayes said the outbreak should ""prompt awareness of the potential for ZIKV to spread to other Pacific Islands and the Americas."" Then, as Hayes predicted, French Polynesia suffered a large outbreak of Zika virus in 2013. This time, however, it also happened to coincide with a 20-fold increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves, causing tingling, muscle weakness and even temporary paralysis in the worst cases.  Zika virus made its way to the Americas by 2015, and Brazil bore the brunt of the outbreak. As many as 1.5 million people in Brazil contracted Zika virus that year, and an alarming potential side effect of the virus began to emerge.The Zika virus outbreak seemed to coincide with a sharp increase in babies born with a birth defect called microcephaly, which is when the brain doesn't develop normally in the womb and babies are born with abnormally small heads. This can have lifelong consequences for the child, including intellectual disabilities, developmental delays and seizures.From 2010 to 2014, Brazil had seen an average of 156 babies born every year with microcephaly. But from October 2015 to January 2016, that number had spiked to over 4,000 babies. Researchers suspected that these infants may have been infected with Zika virus when in the womb, and that the virus may have adversely affected their development.Like French Polynesia, Brazil has experienced an uptick in Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, Brazilian officials have not been able to quantify it because the condition was previously so rare that health officials saw no need to record cases, reports The New York Times. To date, there is no vaccine or cure for Zika virus.Researchers are still confirming the link between Zika virus and conditions like microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, but countries where the virus is widespread -- including Brazil, Colombia and El Salvador -- are already advising women to delay pregnancy. Jamaica issued a similar warning, but hasn't seen a single case of Zika virus case yet. However, Jamaican officials assume it will arrive soon because it's already endemic in neighboring countries, The Associated Press reports.While people in the U.S. have already been diagnosed with Zika virus, they are though to have contracted the disease while traveling abroad. The mother of the baby born with microcephaly in Hawaii likely contracted the virus while she was in Brazil.Yet based on the migration of other mosquito-borne diseases, it may only be a matter of time before states like Texas, Florida and Hawaii start seeing cases that emerge locally, experts say. The migratory patterns of the mosquitos that carry the Zika virus, as well as global travel patterns, may mean Zika will continue to spread before the outbreak dies out. Experts say that the best way to guard against Zika is to wage war on mosquitoes by eliminating stagnant pools of water where they breed and by fumigating areas with mosquito repellant.Graphics by Alissa Scheller for The Huffington Post. This story was updated with more information about other Zika virus cases in the U.K. This story was updated Feb. 3 with new graphics that depict the most recent update on microcephaly cases in Brazil.

"This mosquito doesn't care about your religious or political beliefs.This is what happens when a country outlaws safe abortion for women:The emails arrive at an accelerating pace. Once sporadic, they now come in an incessant stream of 40, 45 or 50 per day....All of them express the same sentiment, the same fear, the same desperate plea.* * *All of them are asking for something that is simple yet elusive - and generally illegal - in this part of the world: abortion pills.The emails are from pregnant women living in those Latin American countries that are rapidly being overrun with the mosquito-borne Zika virus. They are desperately searching for the means to terminate their pregnancies, because they have been diagnosed-or are fearful of being diagnosed--with carrying a transmittable virus that has been strongly linked to microcephaly, a severe and profound birth defect whose notable characteristics are malformed and undersized heads in infants, often coupled with severe brain damage and severe developmental disorders. There are degrees of microcephaly, but it is a condition that does not fully reveal itself until the second trimester.  Because these women live in countries that have criminalized or outlawed abortion, they feel they have no recourse. They must face the prospect of carrying an unwanted, possibly severely disabled fetus to term and raising a severely disabled child through adulthood, or, in some cases, they will be thrown into jail.Many of these women do not have the economic wherewithal or inclination to undergo this experience. Many become pregnant because of simple lack of access to-or social or religious prohibitions against-birth control. Some of these, mostly poor women, will find someone in a squalid back alley who will either sell them some poison to ingest or may even physically rip into their bodies with some rusty tools to terminate their pregnancies. Some of them will probably die in the attempt. Other, slightly more affluent but equally terrified women are putting their trust in the Internet and trying to obtain pills from other countries that will help them to terminate their pregnancy:In more than a thousand emails to Women on Web, a Canada-based group that provides advice and medication for women wanting an abortion in countries where it is banned, the women beg for the pills that are banned by law in their respective countries of Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru or El Salvador.Women on Web assists women, where possible, by supplying them abortifacient pills that allow them to terminate unwanted pregnancies. As noted on their site, some 42 million women a year worldwide have an abortion. The organization, founded in 2005, has been helping women-often impoverished like those in areas affected by the Zika virus-by sending packages of Mifepristone and Misoprostol, abortion-inducing drugs, to women who ask for them. Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, the Dutch physician who started Women on Web, says that the number of women contacting her site has nearly tripled between December and February. She doesn't see any other reasonable explanation for this other than the Zika outbreak.Gomperts provided the Washington Post with copies of emails (with names redacted) her organization has received. The emails paint a picture of sheer desperation from women in Third World countries whose governments, predominantly due to the smothering influence of the Catholic church, have criminalized or outlawed abortion. Because the Zika outbreak originated and is (currently) spreading most rapidly in backward, rural areas of Latin America, one of the things that stands out from these emails is the undercurrent of extreme poverty:""I dare to write you because I'm a resident in Colombia and here the Zika virus is a major problem, although the health authorities haven't recognized it,"" she wrote. ""I want to ask for help because I'm overcome by fear that my baby will be born sick. I already have two girls and work long and hard as a single mother to provide for them. Life in Bogotá is difficult enough without being in charge of a sick child, especially with the health system so precarious in Colombia.""* *  *""I am [name redacted],"" begins one email. ""I contacted Zika 4 days ago. I just found out I'm about 6 weeks pregnant. Today. Today, I found out I'm pregnant. I have a son I love dearly. I love children. But I dont believe it is a wise decision to keep a baby who will suffer. I need an abortion. I don't know who to turn to. Please help me ASAP.""Gomperts says pleas like these represent only the tip of the iceberg. Because only a little more than half of all households in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, where the Zika virus is prevalent, have Internet access, Gomperts fairly assumes that many women are resorting to alternative, unsafe means of terminating their pregnancies when faced with prospect of giving birth to a child with a potential lifetime of unfathomable problems ahead. But they are only the forerunners of a wider health crisis. Even more affluent women, who live in air-conditioned houses and can avoid the mosquito-borne virus for a time-are still at risk.The prohibition on abortion (and even contraception) in many Latin American countries stems from antiquated and obsolete disregard or outright contempt for the rights of women deeply embedded in the traditions of male-dominated religious ""traditions."" Although the Catholic Church's current Pope, Francis, has demonstrated some minor flexibility in the face of this looming women's health crisis, he is constrained by the historical doctrine of the Catholic Church, many of which whose interpretation simply cannot be overcome either by modernity or simple common sense.In the United States, a country whose Founders intentionally fashioned to be free of such dogma, the Republican Party continues to exploit religion as a vehicle for controlling women's reproductive choices, and as a result access to safe and legal abortion is increasingly difficult and deliberately made painful for many women, particularly those states under the legislative domination of the Republican Party, where 235 separate anti-choice Bills were introduced in a three-month period between January and March 2015. The Republican Senate and U.S. House of Representatives in the 114th Congress have introduced 71 Bills since January 2015 alone attempting to either limit or eliminate a woman's right to obtain an abortion. The GOP's Presidential candidates are uniformly in lockstep with their intolerance of women's reproductive rights and several, such as Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, would prohibit or criminalize those rights under any circumstances. Some Republican Congressman have already gone on record stating that Latin American women should ""welcome"" a child with microcephaly.Putting their boot to the necks of women while crowing about the sanctity of life is now de rigueur for Republican politicians. It's an easy position to take, because for the most part these men-and they are nearly all men-have nothing personal to lose. But when the Zika virus hits the shores of the United States, as has begun already, women's tolerance for Republican men waving their fingers in their face and cluck-clucking their disapproval with noxious legislation designed to drive women into back alleys and risk their lives may well come a very swift end, especially if anything like what is happening in Latin America begins to happen here.","dailykos","left","16850","zika",1208
"Remember last week when Democratic Representative John Lewis was leading a sit-in with hopes that some kind of common decency would compel House leadership to bring at least one piece of gun legislation up for a vote? As Republicans were desperately trying ways wrest back control of the House so they could shuffle out of town to start the most generous Fourth of July holiday in the nation, they pushed a bill through. First they called a hilariously inaccurate voice vote, then they used the protest of that voice vote to trigger both a recorded vote an and automatic exit. So  what was that completely undiscussed bill? Lots of things. However, hidden inside it was the House, for the first time, actually responding to President Obama's five month-old request for funding to combat the Zika virus. So  hooray? Yeah, not quite.The military construction and veterans' spending bill forced through by House Republicans with no debate early Thursday morning contains $1.1 billion for Zika preparation and prevention - but it also contains some poison-pill provisions that are likely to drive off any Democratic support, notably one restricting the use of the money by Planned Parenthood. Zika is a contagious disease. It affects unborn children. It can be transmitted sexually. What would be the worst possible thing to do? Well, cutting off funds to over 650 local health clinics that specifically deal with issues of pregnancy and women's health is pretty high up on the list of Insanely Stupid.But wait, this is headed to the conference committee.

"As Zika makes its way north, pregnant women should be concerned about small babies, not only small heads. Despite being world-class and first-rate in every way, for at least a century, the United States has been satisfied in accepting the fact that some newborn babies just won't make it, especially black ones.Nearly seven babies die during their first year of life out of every 1,000 babies born in the United States, putting us in 27th place out of 30 OECD countries, behind Greece, Hungary and Portugal.  Our ranking was 12th in 1960; we've obviously been falling behind in the country that spends more on health care than anyone else. The most common cause of infant mortality is giving birth to a preterm (before 37 weeks gestation) or low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds) baby.  About one in 10 babies is born prematurely among white mothers compared with one in six among black mothers in the United States. And the rate of low birth weight is about twice as high for black mothers compared with white mothers. This racial disparity in negative birth outcomes has been documented for at least a century and should be alarming for anyone concerned about women's and children's health--that is, all of us.A common notion is small and premature babies will by and large ""catch up"" in weight and live long and healthy lives; many of them fortunately do. However, what many people do not realize is that in addition to the tragic outcomes of dying during infancy, negative birth outcomes are also strongly predictive of multiple, serious disabilities for babies, not to mention the emotional and financial toll on their parents and our health care system.  What may come as a surprise, moreover, is negative birth outcomes are also linked to chronic diseases and early death when those babies become adults.Extensive research has demonstrated that known risk factors for negative birth outcomes, such as smoking or drinking during pregnancy or other health conditions, do not fully account for the racial gap in negative birth outcomes.  Research has also demonstrated that socioeconomic factors, such as income, education and wealth, are related to negative birth outcomes; babies born to women with more socioeconomic resources fare better. However, the gap between black and white women exists at all levels of socioeconomic status; some evidence suggests that the gap is actually wider at higher status levels, for example, women with a college degree.Science and theory, in addition to black women's lived experiences, point to racial discrimination as a plausible cause, too. Stressful experiences women face throughout their lives and across generations due to interpersonal interactions like being followed in a store, feeling invisible or socially isolated, getting passed over for a promotion, being called racist labels, as well as to institutional discrimination, such as living in unhealthy neighborhoods, can have a powerful impact on the body. Biologically, chronic stress has known negative effects via neuroendocrine, immunological, and psychosocial pathways that can manifest themselves on a growing fetus, restricting growth and/or triggering premature labor.  In other words, stress gets ""into the body.""Policymakers and the public need to be aware of discrimination's impact on black women's health and the health of their babies. It's high time that the scientific evidence drives policy to eliminate racial inequities in health. A socially just society demands that all women -- especially black women -- should experience pregnancy and birth without the added fear of premature labor or their baby's death.  And black babies deserve an equal chance to live long and healthy lives.","huffingtonpost","left","16898","zika",612
"The news media continues to give the Zika virus a lot of airtime, but there's only so much they can put in the story once they get past the headlines. Here's some more info for those who want it.New York State's Commissioner of Health Dr. Howard Zucker recently gave a webinar presentation on the current state of knowledge of the disease, based on information from the CDC and from the department itself; the Wadsworth Center is one of the few labs in the country equipped to test for the infection. Here's a link to the pdf file containing the Powerpoint slides from the webinar. The intended audience are the health care professionals gearing up to deal with this emerging threat, so some of it is rather technical and clinical.Objectives At the conclusion of this webinar, clinicians will be able to: Describe the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, management, and prevention of Zika virus disease Discuss diagnostic testing for Zika virus infection available through NYSDOH's Wadsworth Center and interpretation of test results Articulate the importance of early recognition and reporting of cases State the recommendations for pregnant women and possible Zika virus exposure Some of the material is specific to New York State, but most of it is generally applicable. Be aware that the slides cover basic information only - the rest of the webinar was able to go into more detail.Cautions: this is information accessible to the public via the internet,  and has already been made available to the media. If you or anyone you know believes they may have been exposed to the Zika virus or suspect infection, they should contact their own healthcare provider rather than trying to contact the NYS DOH or CDC directly, although there is an information line (1-888-364-4723) for the public and healthcare providers to learn more about the virus. (More info here on testing, where to get get it, and who should.)Be aware that the Zika virus is currently the subject of much ongoing research, so new information may become available that may change the recommendations for dealing with it. Much remains to be determined; this briefing is based on what was known as of February 1, 2016 and there is no telling how long it will remain relevant.For more  information, the New York State Department of Health has put together a page of links to web information about the Zika virus. The department's Facebook page is here.","dailykos","left","16836","zika",404

"Sesame Street is a first point of entry for current events for many children. It makes sense, then, that Elmo, the lovable red Muppet, will be teaching his viewers in Latin America and the Caribbean about avoiding mosquito bites and preventing the spread of Zika virus.Sesame Street teamed up with the Pan American Health Organization to reach families and educate them about the mosquito-borne disease, which has been linked to serious birth defects. Elmo will appear in two 30-second PSAs that will be aired in Latin America and the Caribbean in Spanish, Portuguese and English. There are currently no plans to show them in the U.S., USA Today reported.In one of the videos, Elmo and Raya, a turquoise Muppet who was created in 2014 to teach kids about hygiene and sanitation, tell their viewers how to stop mosquito breeding. Their tips include draining and covering water containers and avoiding the accumulation of stagnant water.In the second PSA, Elmo and Raya discuss how to avoid mosquito bites. They say wearing long sleeve shirts and pants and using insect repellent are two smart steps.  Sesame Street has been committed to educating communities -- particularly vulnerable ones -- since its very beginnings in 1969. Beyond lessons on the alphabet and counting, the organization has prioritized broadcasting information to help kids stay healthy and safe.In the Nigerian adaptation of the show, a cab-driving Muppet named Zobi was introduced to educate viewers about malaria in 2011. Similarly to Elmo and Raya, Zobi taught his audience about mosquito safety.   The White House even partnered with the Muppets to promote fresh fruit and vegetable consumption to kids in the U.S. The agreement allowed several produce growers and suppliers to utilize the influence of Sesame Street's brand without a licensing fee.

"The apparent relationship between the Zika virus pandemic in Brazil and the country's rise in cases of the birth defect microcephaly is pushing Brazilian women to resort to abortions -- a procedure that is illegal in Brazil except in cases of rape, anencephaly, or risk to the mother's life.Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that ever since the confirmation of the Zika outbreak, women have been increasingly resorting to Misoprostol, or Cytotec, a drug that induces labor and may cause abortions. They fear that their babies may be born with microcephaly, a congenital condition in which a child is born with a small head and a brain that isn't fully developed.Brazil's Ministry of Health said last week that there have been 404 confirmed cases of microcephaly to date and another 3,670 suspected cases. Scientists have not confirmed a causal link between Zika virus infections and microcephaly. Nor do they know if a woman needs to experience symptoms for her fetus to be at risk of microcephaly (an important question, as about 80 percent of those infected don't even know they have Zika). But health officials and experts strongly suspect that the virus can cause birth defects in babies. Out of an abundance of caution, the World Health Organization advises pregnant women to follow the strictest mosquito bite prevention protocol, which includes wearing long sleeves and pants, using mosquito repellent and avoiding outdoor activities. The nonprofit advocacy organization Anis: Institute of Bioethics, Human Rights and Gender is one of several groups collaborating on a petition to Brazil's Supreme Court to loosen restrictions on abortion. Its co-founder, anthropologist and law professor Debora Diniz, told HuffPost Brasil that the crisis the country is currently facing can be traced back to state negligence with regards to combatting the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is capable of transmitting Zika virus along with dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever. She also noted that the women most at risk come from the country's poorest regions.HuffPost Brasil spoke with Diniz about her work and what she thinks should happen next in the fight against this epidemic. What is your assessment of the spread of Zika virus?We have a national epidemic on our hands. But, even though it has spread across the country, it is concentrated in the Northeastern region of the country and is affecting poor women who find it more difficult to access legal abortions and proper healthcare. The most painful part is that even the Health Minister, Marcelo Castro, has said that we have lost the war. We have to make him understand that we must fight to win. Do you think the government was negligent?What we are witnessing is a delayed result of the Brazilian Government's negligence. This epidemic is the result of the country's ineffectiveness in combating the mosquito. We were able to eradicate it once, and if it comes back, they are the ones to answer for that. There is no doubt that they were late to act. The mosquito returned to this country 40 years ago. [Note: An eradication effort in the 1950s briefly eliminated Aedes aegypti from Brazil, before the effort was abandoned.] It has been four decades. What's new is the hypothesis that the mosquito causes microcephaly. This is most likely the case.What is included in the petition that will be made to the Supreme Court? We're petitioning the government for a bundle of broad public policy actions related to reproductive health; access to contraceptive methods; early, safe diagnoses for microcephaly; improved prenatal care; and the right to an abortion in the event of a positive diagnosis. Also, the women who have already given birth to babies with microcephaly need to have various options and there should be a strong social policy that supports infants.The Ministry of Health claims to be offering support The ministry has not presented anything new. The continuing benefit program and a monthly stipend for poor families already exist. What we need is to have a generation supported by the Brazilian constitution. A challenge lies ahead of us. We need a wide-reaching policy for this generation of children who have specific needs and whom the Brazilian state is not prepared to support.How did you react to the criticism -- most notably in the case of Ana Carolina Caseres, the journalist who was diagnosed as microcephalic as a baby and is now speaking out about microcephalic rights -- that there are different levels of ability related to the disorder that should be taken into consideration when easing abortion regulations?We've already excluded people who have been raped, where the fetus is not at risk but where, as the State recognizes, the woman suffers greatly during her pregnancy. Today we have women facing undue consequences because nothing was done to stop these mosquitos. The issue here is not about the fetus. We have an epidemic on our hands and we are not forcing women to choose [an abortion]. But we want the state to recognize that women should have that choice.That said, microcephaly exists at different levels. There may be a case of microcephaly with an extremely severe level of impairment, and there can be milder cases too. Generalizing can get dangerous. It may lead to allowing the abortion of a child who might have relatively few symptoms. That is always an argument, but we're not comparing this to anencephaly, which often leads to death.Do you expect the petition to have an effect in a timely manner, knowing how slow the courts can be?The decision on abortions in cases of anencephaly took eight years. If I guide myself by past events, I would be even more pessimistic. I hope that the Supreme Court understands that this is an emergency and that they have to move quickly to improve public healthcare.And what about pressure coming from Bancada Evangelica, the conservative, religious faction within Brazil's House of Representatives? If that were a real fear, democracy as a whole would not work in this country. If you take into account the overlap between religion and politics that puts abortion in the spotlight in the midst of a political scandal and economic crisis, you're closing the door. Our courage must be greater. We must be strong enough to confront the problem.What is the international opinion on abortions for women infected with Zika virus?Abortion is legal in most countries, so that discussion is not relevant.

"Brazil has launched a door-to-door campaign executed by 220,000 soldiers to combat the spread of the Zika virus. The campaign launches as one of the nation's largest newspapers reports that medical experts have recorded more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly in the nation.The Zika virus spreads through bites from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which also carries Dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya. The virus is common throughout Latin America and in the warmest parts of the rest of the hemisphere; only Canada and Chile lack an Aedes aegypti population. While medical experts long believed Zika to be a mild viral infection, with symptoms resembling a weaker Dengue fever, Zika appears to be extremely dangerous to pregnant women. Brazilian authorities have documented thousands of cases of pregnant women diagnosed with Zika giving birth to babies with microcephaly, a condition in which the baby is born with an abnormally small head. Children with microcephaly typically suffer severe mental damage.O Globo reports today that Brazil's health ministry has announced that the number of diagnosed microcephaly cases where the mother tested positive for Zika has surpassed 4,000, and that they are diagnosing 200 such cases a week. In response, the government will be launching an awareness campaign with the slogan ""A mosquito is not stronger than a whole nation.""The slogan contradicts some controversial comments by Brazilian Health Minister Marcelo Castro, who told reporters on Tuesday that the nation was ""badly losing the battle against the mosquito."" The Associated Press notes that Brazil had once eradicated Aedes aegypti entirely in the 1950s, but had since resurfaced in Brazil as populations traveled across Latin America.Castro has received significant backlash for the comment, AP notes. World Health Organization spokesman Christian Lindmeier described his remarks as ""fatalistic."" A columnist for O Globo demanded he resign.President Dilma Rousseff has promised Brazil will begin ""a real battle"" against the virus this week, beginning with the soldier door-to-door deployment. The soldiers will distribute informational literature as well as insect repellant, and warn pregnant women especially to protect themselves by wearing long-sleeved clothing and avoiding outdoor activities in humid areas.The Brazilian government announced that 400,000 women on government welfare will receive insect repellant, as well.As the Southern Hemisphere's summer continues, Zika has become a significant problem for a number of countries across South and Central America. In addition to Brazil, the governments of El Salvador and Colombia have warned women to avoid getting pregnant if possible during the warm summer months. San Salvador warned women to avoid getting pregnant between now and 2018 if at all possible, as the nation struggles to enhance its health infrastructure.The World Health Organization, through its regional branch, has warned Zika will likely spread across all nations on the hemisphere save for the aforementioned Chile and Canada. Cases have been documented throughout the United States - particularly Illinois, Puerto Rico, and New York - though the cases outside of tropical territories have been travelers to nations known to host the offending mosquito.","breitbart","right","16827","zika",499
"The Zika virus continues to spread and is drastically affecting countries throughout Central and South America, as well as Mexico. At a press conference today, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that there is now a ""public health emergency of international concern"" over the clusters of microcephaly in Brazil and the suspected (although not scientifically proven) link to microcephaly and birth defects. It's important to note that this is not a declaration for the actual Zika virus. WHO also stated that ""there should be no restrictions on travel or trade with countries, areas and/or territories with Zika virus transmission."" RELATED: What You Need to Know About the Zika VirusThe virus's greatest potential threat is to pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant. Airlines and cruise lines are recognizing this threat. Some providers are offering refunds or waived cancelation fees for pre-booked travel. See below for a list of companies offering refunds related to Zika. Editor's Note: For up-to-date information, please check the CDC and WHO websites regularly, and directly contact airlines, hotels, cruise lines, and travel agents you have booked with if you are looking to rebook or get a refund or credit for pre-booked travel to the affected areas. We will update this article with more information as it becomes available. None of the major hotel chains are yet offering refunds, but are taking precautionary measures like providing mosquito spray and educating employees on prevention. However, reservation cancelations are up according to a recent New York Times article, and hotel chains like Hilton, Hyatt, and the Four Seasons are reportedly considering waivers for cancelations. This is largely being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but according to Travel Weekly, Classic Vacations and Pleasant Holidays are working with customers to reschedule, waive fees, and receive refunds. Packagers have also reported seeing increased requests for cancelations. According to Phil Sylvester, Chief Content and Communications Manager of World Nomads, Zika is being treated just like an illness, so medical costs associated with the disease would be covered: ""The standard conditions apply to pregnancy (regardless of Zika): If a pregnant woman becomes ill prior to departure, and their medical practitioner declares them medically unfit to travel, they are covered for cancelation costs. If the insured becomes pregnant after they purchased their policy (and before their trip starts) that is a valid reason to cancel. Note, none of that has anything to do specifically with Zika virus.""If you are pregnant, Sylvester emphasizes it's important to note that, ""There's no coverage for 'change of mind.' For the cancelation conditions to take effect, we need a government declaration against travel to a destination. So far the wording from State and WHO and CDC has been just short of that. They're strongly suggesting pregnant women change their travels plans, but they're not saying 'don't go.'""Two companies offer plans with a Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR): RoamRight and Travel Insured International. These might be worth looking into if you are pregnant and need to travel to these areas. It's important to consult your physician if you're pregnant or hoping to become pregnant and planning to travel to these areas. Consider travel insurance, take preventative measures, keep yourself updated, and contact any travel providers directly for their policies on the virus. Read the original story: Worried About Zika?

"At a historic summit in Uruguay, the health ministers of fourteen Latin American nations, alongside representatives from the regional wing of the World Health Organization, agreed on a number of measures to contain the Zika virus pandemic consuming the continent, including a ""fast access"" Zika information network at airports and border crossings.The network, Chile's Publimetro reports, would ""orient citizens regarding preventative and control measures currently in development by governments, in agreement with the epidemiological situation."" In addition to this agreement, the nations agreed to launch awareness campaigns in high-risk areas, teaching locals how to rid themselves of still water pools that could serve as breeding grounds for the Aedes aegypti mosquito.This species of mosquito carries the Zika virus and is found throughout the Americas, with Canada and Chile the only exceptions. As the Southern Hemisphere is currently in the middle of its summer, its nations have been the most affected by Zika, particularly Brazil. Zika is often difficult to diagnose because up to 80 percent of those infected do not show symptoms, and adults who do typically experience mild symptoms like fevers and conjunctivitis. The biggest danger Zika poses is to the unborn; Brazilian doctors have found links between a pregnant mother contracting Zika and her child being born with microcephaly, a disorder in which an infant's skull is too small for his or her brain, causing severe neurological damage. Experts are also studying a potential link between Zika and Guillain-Barré syndrome, a debilitating muscular disorder.","breitbart","right","16835","zika",249
"A Colombian businessman has fully recovered from the Zika virus after doctors diagnosed him in Johannesburg, South Africa.""The infection was acquired in Columbia prior to his visit to Johannesburg for business. Columbia is currently experiencing a large outbreak of the Zika virus,"" declared the Department of Health.The man reported a fever and rash four days after he landed in South Africa. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) performed a test that came back positive for Zika.""The NICD can confirm that indeed the test confirmed the diagnosis of the Zika Virus Infection in the Columbian businessman visiting Johannesburg. The man experienced mild illness and has made a full recovery,"" stated NICD Deputy Director Lucille Bloomberg.In late January, the NICD said the country ""is not likely to be at risk of Zika."" Bloomberg reported that the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which carry the virus, ""have not been shown to be competent vectors"" in this part of the world.The virus surfaced on Cape Verde, an island located off the coast of Senegal, in October. Since then, doctors have confirmed more than 7,000 Zika cases. Clinics have diagnosed 100 pregnant women with the virus, but doctors report no one has found evidence of microcephaly in any scans. Microcephaly occurs when the brain does not form properly during the pregnancy or after birth, leading to smaller than normal heads.The discoveries have instilled fear into experts that the disease might spread to Africa, returning after two Scottish scientists discovered it in Uganda 70 years ago. While primarily found in Africa, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes live in all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere. (Chile and Canada are the exceptions.) The species also carries dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya.""The confirmation of this particular case poses no risk to the South African population as the virus is not transmitted from human to human but through the Aedes aegypti mosquitoe [sic], and/or possibly from mother to the foetus in pregnant women,"" continued the Health Department.The World Health Organization (WHO) said the disease ""appears to have changed in character."" Mary Kay Kindhauser said the virus mutated ""as it moved through Asia - from an infection causing limited cases of mild illness to one leading to large outbreaks and, from 2013 onwards, linked to babies born with neurological disorders and abnormally small heads.""""There are a few genetic differences between the African and Asian lineages, and it looks like the Asian lineages may be better able to transmit and flourish in a human population,"" said Jimmy Whitworth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) placed Cape Verde on its travel warning list at the Level 2 alert, urging travelers to ""practice enhanced precautions.""""Cape Verde has historical links with Brazil and it seems very likely it has got there from Brazil,"" explained Zika expert Nick Beeching of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.He believes the virus will land on the mainland due to ""regular flight connections from the Atlantic islands.""Colombia has recorded 37,000 Zika cases, among them 6,300 pregnant women. Doctors ""confirmed the presence of Zika in 522 of those cases."" Unlike Brazil, Colombia has not linked any babies with microcephaly to Zika, even though the country has the largest number of Zika cases.","breitbart","right","16854","zika",548
"More than 3,000 infants in Brazil have been diagnosed with brain deformities believed to have been triggered by the Zika virus, a disease similar to dengue fever that has become increasingly common as the Southern Hemisphere's summer wears on.Brazil's Ministry of Health has recorded 3,530 cases of microcephaly in infants that it believes is the product of the mother's contraction of Zika virus, Brazilian newspaper O Globo reports. Children with microcephaly are born with smaller brains and skulls, leading to a variety of mental disorders and, in some cases, death. Brazilian officials warned that they had recorded 356 suspected cases of microcephaly linked to Zika in the past week alone.The Wall Street Journal notes that Brazilian officials appear significantly confident that Zika is to blame for these cases of microcephaly. ""Before the explosion of cases since mid-2015, Brazil had an average 150 cases of microcephaly a year. Today I can tell you that we have 100% certainty of the connection of the Zika virus with increasing cases of microcephaly in Brazil,"" Brazilian Health Minister Marcelo Castro told the newspaper.Brazilian scientists announced this week that they have confirmed at least four cases in which the mother's contracting of Zika virus led to her child being born with microcephaly. In addition, researchers are finding preliminary ties between Zika and another birth deformity: arthrogryposis, a disorder which creates joints incapable of full mobility, shielded by weak muscles. Doctors have linked at least two cases of arthrogryposis with Zika, both in pregnant women who have yet to give birth.The Zika virus is transmitted through bites from the mosquito species aedes aegypti, which is also responsible for carrying diseases like dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever. The species lives only in southern regions and thrives in humid climates. Given the presence of the El Niño phenomenon this year, Brazilian authorities have been expecting a spike in Zika cases, with O Globo going so far as calling this season the ""summer of Zika.""Among adults, Zika is rarely deadly and can only be treated through giving a patient fluids and waiting for the virus to subside. Its impact on in-utero children has triggered an international alarm, however.At least two cases of Zika have been documented in the United States-in Texas and Puerto Rico-this year, though neither appear deadly and children are not involved.In December, Brazilian health authorities began suggesting to couples planning on having children to delay their attempts to conceive as long as possible, or at least until the Zika threat subsides. ""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" Angela Rocha, pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Pernambuco, told CNN.","breitbart","right","16813","zika",456
"The World Health Organization has declared the Zika virus a public health emergency due to the thousands of cases of the virus linked to birth defects in newborn children.""I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities reported in Latin America following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014 constitutes a public health emergency of international concern,"" announced WHO director general Margaret Chan.The National Health Institute confirmed 20,297 cases in Colombia. The latest numbers ""make Colombia the second most affected country in the region, after Brazil."" The majority of those infected live in the Caribbean region. More than 60% of those are women.""This is an extraordinary event,"" she continued. ""It poses a public health threat to other parts of the world and a coordinated international response is needed.""Last week, the WHO warned the disease had ""explosive pandemic potential."" Marcos Espinal, head of Communicable Diseases and Health Analysis for the WHO's regional satellite, the Pan American Health Organization, predicted the world could see ""3 to 4 million cases of Zika virus disease.""WHO may declare a public health emergency following these regulations:The process dictates the director general must meet with a committee of experts, who provides ""measures to be promulgated on an emergency basis, known as temporary recommendations.""Aedes aegypti mosquitos carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations. (Chile and Canada are the exceptions.) They also carry Dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya. Doctors found the disease in one infant during an autopsy, and numerous mothers reported symptoms.Patients often experience mild symptoms with Zika, but pregnant women face a larger danger. Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly, which occurs when the brain does not form properly and results in a small head. This leads to serious mental disabilities.Following the outbreak of Zika, Brazil has discovered over 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked over 2,400 cases compared to the 147 in 2014. Colombia confirmed more than 2,100 pregnant women have Zika.Colombian officials urged women to delay pregnancy due to the outbreak.""It is recommended that women postpone - to the extent possible - the decision to become pregnant until the country can move out of the epidemic phase of the Zika virus,"" pleaded the Health Ministry.Brazil, El Salvador, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico have also advised women against getting pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.The National Institutes of Health acknowledged that the Zika virus outbreak has reached pandemic levels in Latin America.""You have multiple countries in South America and in the Caribbean, so by anybody's definition that would be considered a pandemic,"" explained Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases branch at the institute.","breitbart","right","16832","zika",502
"For families in Latin America, and women across the world in the mosquito zone concerned about giving birth to children with microcephaly, the news that Latin American doctors are suggesting Monsanto pesticide used to kill mosquito larvae may actually be the link is epic.As the Zika epidemic ""spreads explosively"" around the world, pregnant travelers have been put on pause due to the virus's suspected association with microcephaly, the congenital condition in which a baby's head is abnormally small.While the link between the mosquito-borne virus and microcephaly has yet to be scientifically proven, Argentinian and Brazilian doctors have suggested an alternate culprit: pesticides.It's still heartbreaking news for pregnant women within those zones where this larvicide has been used in, yes, DRINKING WATER, to combat mosquito populations.And yet, for the long term, it may be hopeful in that stopping the use of this larvicide in drinking water may be much easier than stopping the proliferation of Aedes species mosquito which thrives in urban areas and in water sources as small as a bottle cap and is spreading throughout the world.Though some are disputing this chemical link, the evidence is compelling.The report, written by the Argentine group Physicians in the Crop-Sprayed Towns (PCST), suspects that pyriproxyfen-a larvicide added to drinking water to stop the development of mosquito larvae in drinking water tanks-has caused the birth defects.The authors said that the pesticide, known by its commercial name SumiLarv, is manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical, a Japanese subsidiary of Monsanto.According to PCST, in 2014, the Brazilian Ministry of Health introduced pyriproxyfen to drinking-water reservoirs in the state of Pernambuco, where the proliferation of the Zika-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito is very high.""Malformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state added pyriproxyfen to drinking water is not a coincidence, even though the Ministry of Health places a direct blame on Zika virus for this damage, while trying to ignore its responsibility and ruling out the hypothesis of direct and cumulative chemical damage caused by years of endocrine and immunological disruption of the a acted population,"" PCST said.Adding:""Previous Zika epidemics did not cause birth defects in newborns, despite infecting 75 percent of the population in those countries,"" the paper said. ""Also, in other countries such as Colombia there are no records of microcephaly; however, there are plenty of Zika cases.""The debate will continue. Some will need to save face. Others may have money riding on Zika Virus vaccine development.Zika-related microcephaly can be difficult to confirm. The Washington Post reported last month that after experts scrutinized 732 of the cases out 4,180 cases of Zika-related microcephaly, they found more than half either weren't microcephaly or weren't even related to Zika at all. In fact, according to the ministry bulletin, just 270 were confirmed as microcephaly that appears to be linked to Zika or other infectious diseases.However, as PBS's Frontline reported last week, Pernambuco researchers have identified clear evidence of the microcephaly-Zika link. According to the report, ""researchers here tested the spinal fluid of 12 babies with microcephaly, all of whom were born to mothers who reported having symptoms of Zika early in their pregnancies. In all 12 cases, the researchers found evidence of Zika.""Secretary of Vigilance and Health Luciana Albuquerque said in a press conference at the Pernambuco Health Department that ""this is not a scientific study,"" noting that the results do not indicate a definitive causal link but added, ""it's a very important suggestion of the link.""The WHO officially declared Zika a global health emergency and officials are carefully monitoring the spread. Researchers are also currently racing to develop a vaccine.As a biologist, ecologist, a woman..I sincerely hope the use of the Monsanto larvicide in drinking water supplies will be stopped immediately. I suspect we'll see an immediate rapid decline in microcephaly cases.","dailykos","left","16846","zika",658
"The rapidly spreading Zika virus -- which can be transmitted sexually and by mosquitos -- is most dangerous for pregnant women. But Republicans in Congress on Thursday released a funding proposal limiting the distribution of contraceptives and preventing family planning organizations like Planned Parenthood from participating in the effort to help women in Zika-affected areas delay pregnancy. The House passed a proposal that allocates $1.1 billion to fight the Zika virus -- just over half the amount the Obama administration requested four months ago to stop the epidemic. Democrats are furious that Republicans short-changed the president's funding request. They are particularly upset that the bill excludes $50 million in requested funds for maternal and child health and blocks supplemental funds from going to Planned Parenthood for birth control services. The bill mandates that the Zika funds be prioritized for mosquito control programs, vaccines and diagnostics, leaving no resources for contraceptives or condoms. ""It is unthinkable that in the face of a public health emergency, Republicans chose to pass a hyperpartisan proposal that doubles down on using women's health as a political football by restricting access to women's health care, like contraception, which is especially critical to preventing the spread of this virus,"" said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member on the Senate Health Committee. Zika has been linked with the birth defect microcephaly, which causes babies to be born with underdeveloped brains and abnormally small heads. Several countries are advising women to delay pregnancy while the threat of Zika looms, which has increased the demand for abortions and put a spotlight on the need for effective family planning. Planned Parenthood said the GOP policy ""mocks the seriousness of this looming public health crisis,"" which has already afflicted thousands of babies across South and Latin America -- and one so far in the continental United States. ""In the face of threats to the public, elected officials have a responsibility to rise above politics and take meaningful action,"" said Dana Singiser, a Planned Parenthood executive. ""Instead, Republicans have once again reverted back to the same agenda we have seen time and time again of attacking women's health care. It is just common sense that women need more access to basic family planning at home and abroad in the face of Zika, not less."" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said the bill would sufficiently address the crisis. ""It is a responsible plan that assures the administration will continue to have the needed resources to protect the public,"" he said. Democrats vowed to block the bill from passing until Republicans agree to a more robust and comprehensive solution. The White House also condemned it on Thursday. ""It is clear that once again, Republicans have put political games ahead of the health and safety of the American people, particularly pregnant women and their babies,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. ""This plan from congressional Republicans is four months late and nearly a billion dollars short of what our public health experts have said is necessary to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus, and steals funding from other health priorities."" ","huffingtonpost","left","16975","zika",535
"KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Jamaica's health minister is advising women to delay plans to become pregnant for the next six to 12 months due to the mosquito-borne Zika virus.The island has not even recorded any cases of Zika, which is spreading in the Americas and is suspected of causing over 3,500 babies to be born with brain damage in Brazil.But Health Minister Horace Dalley says it's just a matter of time before the dengue-like virus makes it to the island. It is already confirmed in nearby Haiti.Dalley said Monday in a statement that pregnant women should take extra precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.Growing evidence links Zika to microcephaly, a rare condition in which newborns have smaller than normal heads and their brains do not develop properly.","huffingtonpost","left","16819","zika",155
"Leftist groups and government officials are pressuring pregnant women in the Americas to disregard the sanctity of life in response to the mosquito-borne Zika virus and abort children diagnosed with brain deformities tied to the virus.In Zika-affected countries and territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, a region where abortion is very difficult, if not illegal, the virus outbreak has sparked a debate over the permissibility of abortion in pregnant women infected with the virus, which has been linked to a neurological disorder known as microcephaly that makes it especially dangerous to pregnant women and their babies.Microcephaly is a birth defect that causes babies to be born with smaller heads than normal and often have developmental problems.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned pregnant American women and females of childbearing age who may become pregnant against traveling to most countries in the Americas where the Zika virus has spread.CDC lists 24 countries and territories with active Zika virus transmissions, including 22 located in the Americas: Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Suriname, US Virgin Islands and Venezuela.""In many of these countries it is very difficult, if not impossible, for women who are already pregnant to get an abortion,"" reports the Guardian.In Brazil, the hardest-hit country, an editorial published by O Globo uses the ""national calamity"" to push mothers to disregard the sanctity of life, a position that has been emulated in editorials across Latin America.""It is essential to recognize that women and men have the right to make decisions and existential options and one of the most important choices in the life of a woman is to have children or not,"" argues the editorial by sociologist Jacqueline Pitanguy, expressing a view point similar to that of the United Nations, which believes abortion is a human right.In Brazil, one of the most abortion-restrictive countries in the world, the practice is only allowed to save the pregnant women's life and in case of rape or incest, reports the Guardian, citing the Center for Reproductive Rights, Amnesty, and Human Rights Watch. At least one judge in the country has announced he would allow abortions for women who can prove their children will be born with microcephaly and that they have the Zika virus inside them.""The current epidemiological context urgently demands a public debate in the republic, plural and respectful of the right to abortion, anchored in the parameters of choice versus authoritarian imposition,"" argues the O Globo.Leftist Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is reportedly engaging religious leaders as part of her government's campaign against Zika to help increase awareness and prevention of the disease. Religious leaders there have not yet remarked on efforts to promote abortion in light of the Zika outbreak.Colombia, a traditionally right-wing country that has arguably been pushed leftwards by current President Juan Manuel Santos, has been the second hardest-hit country, according to the Associated Press (AP).There, Fernando Ruiz, the deputy health minister, has said pregnant women suspected of being infected by Zika can have legal access to an abortion if they can prove that the fetus has the neurological disorder microcephaly, reports Radio Nacional de Colombia.""Colombia's penal code prohibits abortion in all circumstances, though the penalty is substantially lower where the pregnancy is the result of rape or non-consensual artificial insemination,"" reports the Guardian.In an editorial published by online news outlet El Faro, which covers Latin America, author Laura Aguirre, a doctoral student in sociology at the Institute of Latin American Studies at the Free University of Berlin, ridicules the suggestion by the government of El Salvador for women to abstain from getting pregnant until 2017 to avoid the Zika virus in the country, and suggests that they should be granted access to abortion instead.El Faro notes that Aguirre's college thesis was ""framed within feminist critical perspectives.""In El Salvador, ""abortion is illegal with no explicit exception to save a woman's life, with legislation for exceptions having been abolished,"" explains the Guardian.Monica Roa, a spokesman for Women's Link Worldwide, a pro-abortion NGO, described restrictive abortion laws in Brazil, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic as a ""gap in sexual education.""She indicated that recommendations to postpone pregnancies are ""unrealistic,"" suggesting that abortions are a better option because most pregnancies in the region are unplanned.Puerto Rico, where the transmission the disease has been detected, is not immune to the abortion debate shaping up across Latin America.Health authorities in the U.S. territory have avoided entering the debate, argues a news reporter in the Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo Dia.The article quotes Dr. Brenda Rivera Garcia, director of the Epidemiology division at the Department of Health in Puerto Rico, as saying that ""on the question of allowing abortions in cases where fetuses are identified with microcephalyit would be very difficult, particularly because the scans performed to identify the disorder are carried out late in gestation.""""Under US constitutional law, which applies in Puerto Rico, abortion is permitted provided the fetus is not viable, or if the woman's health is at risk,"" points out the Guardian. ""However, Puerto Rico also has a criminal statute on the books which prohibits abortions except to protect a woman's health, a crime punishable by two years' imprisonment. It is not clear which law supersedes the other.""","breitbart","right","16829","zika",920
"A new essay in the online journal Politico decries a series of new legislative measures restricting abortions, arguing that effective research to combat the Zika virus somehow depends on the unfettered right to legally kill children in the womb and freely trade with their harvested tissue.Politico writer Brett Norman paints a dire picture of conservative lawmakers in the U.S. passing draconian laws aimed at blocking research on the tissue of aborted children, suggesting that such research ""might reveal the keys to unlocking the disease and preventing the massive birth defects associated with it.""Norman rightly underscores the righteous ""furor"" caused by the release of the scandalous Planned Parenthood sting videos throughout 2015 that showed officials from the abortion giant casually discussing the harvesting and sale of baby parts.The essay claims that ""scientists"" who say that laws restricting abortion ""are becoming roadblocks to the research needed to combat Zika."" Without providing any evidence for his claim, Norman writes that scientists are hesitant to say anything because they ""fear the wrath of anti-abortion activists.""One doctor willing to be cited was obstetrician Patrick Ramsey, who said that using the tissue from aborted babies may help others to stay healthy. ""This is a situation where the vaccine is going to have to protect the mom and protect the baby. Fetal tissue is going to be needed to look at the effects,"" he said.Stooping to a new level of fear-mongering, Norman suggests that blocking Planned Parenthood's fetal research business could actually cause ""more abortions,"" and that some of the states to be hardest hit by the Zika virus will be those trying to restrict Planned Parenthood's business.""Florida is also among the states at greatest risk from the virus,"" Norman writes, ""which is carried by a species of mosquito endemic to the Gulf Coast. It's also a major travel hub for the Caribbean and South America, where the virus has already broken out.""As a toady for Planned Parenthood, Norman fails to mention that regardless of the possible medical knowledge gained from research on the tissue of aborted babies, there is a moral issue at play that deeply concerns a growing number of U.S. citizens. The sort of activity involved in harvesting human tissue is not indifferent to the morality of the research done on it.Historians acknowledge, for instance, that significant advances in medical science came about as a result of research on prisoners of the Third Reich during World War II. But no amount of positive medical benefit can possibly justify the immoral activities involved in obtaining it.Planned Parenthood and its lackeys are squirming as Americans study ways to legally curtail the organization's deplorable practices, and no number of propaganda pieces will change the reality of what countless citizens have now seen with their own eyes.Follow Thomas D.

"Looking the photo after photo of babies affected by the Zika virus is almost unbearable. Hearing about the children in Michigan who have lead poisoning from drinking from the local water supply is heartbreaking. For most, it is hard to imagine what life will be like for these families.   Many people may assume that the children will be ""fine.""  In part, this is because stories of children with special needs are usually inspirational.  These stories usually begin with parents being presented with the worse-case scenario, the possibility of a child with a disability.  Yet, they nearly always end happily even though the happy ending varies:  the child never had a problem afterall; the mother sought out just the right therapy to help her child exceeded all expectations; the family learned the ""true"" meaning of love and hope as a result of their child's disability and their child is able to live an almost-normal life.  Almost unheard of are stories that do not have happy endings, stories of children whose disability turned out to be more severe than expected; children who do not respond to recommended therapies; families who struggle caring for a child with significant needs.  As the mother of a child with a disability I know first-hand that not all stories involving children with disabilities end happily and that these stories are perhaps more common that the ""feel good"" stories of disability that are so commonly published.  I fear that the stories of children born with microcelephy as a result of the Zika virus and the children in Michigan who are dealing with lead poisoning will not end happily either.  What might the lives of these families look like? There will of course some better times, but the reality of what these families will face will also be difficult.  Progress may be slow or even non-existent.  Children with disabilities often face significant struggles. The struggles each child will face will be different but may include struggles to communicate, eat, toilet, keep up with peers, read, or learn basic math. Despite the best of efforts to help them, progress may still be extremely slow or may not occur at all.   Parents will share in their child's frustrations and cry along with them.  The need to advocate is never-ending.  Having a child with a disability means constantly having to advocate. When a child has a disability it is often necessary to advocate on a daily basis.  It may be necessary to advocate for medical care, funding for recommended therapies, appropriate education, and even for accessible seats at the movie theater or on a bus.  There is constant fear and stress.  Services are always in danger of being taken away, either because the criteria for eligibility may change, a child's diagnosis may change, or because funding is cut.  There is also the fear of what will happen to your child when you are no longer around to care for them knowing that will not be able to care for themselves.  The costs of providing for a child with special needs who is unlikely to be able to ever support themselves dwarfs the costs of college and keeps many parents up at night.","huffingtonpost","left","16862","zika",559

"Brazilian Health Minister Marcelo Castro admitted the Zika outbreak is worse than previous reports made it appear.""Eighty percent of the people infected by Zika do not develop significant symptoms. A large number of people have the virus with no symptoms, so the situation is more serious than we can imagine,"" he told Reuters. ""Our big hope is finding a vaccine.""Castro also informed the outlet the country will demand mandatory reporting of the virus.Rio de Janeiro officials have been recording two new cases of Zika every hour. The local government reported 1,499 notifications of potential diagnoses of the disease in the first 29 days of 2016, though doctors only confirmed 64 Zika infections. Edimilson Migowski, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), claims the ""records of suspected cases account for only 2% of the total number of infected people, which is close to 75,000.""Scientists believe they can produce a vaccine ready for human tests by the end of 2016.""This vaccine is easy to produce. It could be cranked to very high levels in a really short time,"" said Canadian scientist Gary Kobinger.It might take a decade to legalize the use of the vaccine, but Kobinger ""hopes governments will allow the use of it in emergency situations.""""What would take the longest time would be the process of passing it through the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and other regulatory agencies to allow it for public use and that may take up to 10 to 12 years,"" explained Nikos Vasilakis, an expert at the Centre for Biodefence and Emerging Infectious Diseases in Galveston, TX.Mild effects of Zika burden scientists' ability to research the disease, but pregnant women face a larger danger.Experts are working to understand what has now become a clear link between Zika and microcephaly. The disorder occurs if the brain does not form properly in pregnancy or stops growing after birth, which causes a small head. This leads to serious mental disabilities, seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and feeding problems.""The microcephaly cases are increasing by the week and we do not have an estimate of how many there will be. The situation is serious and worrying,"" stated Castro.Aedes aegypti mosquitos carry the disease. While primarily found in Africa, all but two nations on the Western Hemisphere boast significant populations (Chile and Canada are the exceptions). They also carry Dengue, yellow fever, and Chikungunya. Doctors found the disease in one infant during an autopsy and numerous mothers reported symptoms.Colombian officials urged women to delay pregnancy due to the outbreak.""It is recommended that women postpone - to the extent possible - the decision to become pregnant until the country can move out of the epidemic phase of the Zika virus,"" pleaded the Health Ministry.Medical officials in Brazil, El Salvador, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico have also advised women against getting pregnant.""It's a very personal decision, but at this moment of uncertainty, if families can put off their pregnancy plans, that's what we're recommending,"" stated Angela Rocha, the pediatric infectologist at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Brazil.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Zika virus a public health emergency due to the thousands of cases of the virus linked to birth defects in newborn children.""I am now declaring that the recent cluster of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities reported in Latin America following a similar cluster in French Polynesia in 2014 constitutes a public health emergency of international concern,"" announced WHO director general Margaret Chan.Castro and scientists speculate Zika caused the 3,700 cases of microcephaly in Brazil.""This is an extraordinary event,"" she continued. ""It poses a public health threat to other parts of the world and a coordinated international response is needed.""Last week, the WHO warned the disease had ""explosive pandemic potential."" Marcos Espinal, head of Communicable Diseases and Health Analysis for the WHO's regional satellite, the Pan American Health Organization, predicted the world could see ""3 to 4 million cases of Zika virus disease.""The National Institutes of Health acknowledged that the Zika virus outbreak has reached pandemic levels in Latin America.""You have multiple countries in South America and in the Caribbean, so by anybody's definition that would be considered a pandemic,"" explained Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases branch at the institute.","breitbart","right","16832","zika",723
"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - Zika has landed forcefully in America, in one of its poorest and most vulnerable corners, a debt-ridden territory lacking a functioning health-care system, window screens and even a spray that works against the mosquitoes spreading the virus in homes, workplaces, schools and parks.There are 117 confirmed cases of the virus in Puerto Rico, four times the number at the end of January. The island territory, which has a population of 3.5 million people, is ""by far the most affected area"" in the United States, Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said Friday.

"The world is in a frenzy over the Zika virus. Researchers established a link between its rise in Brazil and cases of congenital microcephaly in babies of infected pregnant women, with infants born with smaller than expected heads and improper brain development. As of November last year, Brazil's northeastern state of Pernambuco recorded 646 babies born with microcephaly. On February 1, the World Health Organization (WHO)  declared the virus and its suspected link to birth defects an international public health emergency.Though we don't yet understand the exact relationship between Zika and microcephaly, there is clear cause for concern. But even more troubling is a virus brewing beneath the surface: rumors circulating online that this birth abnormality is actually caused by the Tdap vaccine given to pregnant women. It's not. When the anti-vaxxer movement meets a global health pandemic, the consequences could be dire.Zika does carry potential dangers for expectant mothers and their babies. But the virus is tame compared to its local counterparts -- dengue is nicknamed ""break-bone fever,"" chikungunya ""bending-up fever."" But it is really tame compared to tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, the bacterial infections against which Tdap protects.Tetanus affects the brain and nervous system, causing painful muscle spasms that can be strong enough to make it impossible to open one's mouth. It kills one in five infected. Diphtheria causes difficulty breathing and can lead to heart and nerve damage. Pertussis, otherwise known as whooping cough, is a respiratory infection that can result in serious breathing problems. It is very contagious, and particularly dangerous for infants, with severe cases resulting in pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, or death.The danger to babies of contracting these infections, particularly pertussis, has led the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to recommend that all pregnant women be vaccinated in their third trimester to help protect a newborn in the first months of life. Lest we think that it is only big public health agencies that send out these messages, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Nurse-Midwives, which specialize in caring for pregnant women, echo this recommendation.Tdap provides early and much-needed protection for infants. The mother's body uses the vaccine to create protective antibodies that are then passed onto the baby before birth. The first months of a baby's life present the greatest risk, particularly for contracting whooping cough, both in terms of risk for infection and severe, life-threatening complications from the disease. Pertussis might start like a cold, with a mild cough or runny nose, but within one to two weeks, children can start struggling for breath after a coughing fit, making ""whooping"" sounds. Babies may gag and gasp. It might be difficult to breath, eat, drink, or sleep, with a cough getting severe enough to cause vomiting or a lack of oxygen.It's easy to understand why we would want to prevent these diseases if we could.In 2014, the CDC recorded 32,971 cases of pertussis in the United States. Between 2000 and 2014, there were 277 deaths from whooping cough; 87 percent were babies younger than 3 months old.But compare this to numbers before vaccines became widely available. Back in the 1940s, about 200,000 children were infected with whooping cough each year in the United States, with 9,000 deaths resulting. Tetanus infected and killed several hundred per year. Diphtheria was the third leading cause of death in children in England and Wales in the 1930s, with nearly half of those infected dying from the disease.Vaccines have dramatically curtailed rates of pertussis, and nearly eradicated cases of tetanus and diphtheria in the U.S. Although work remains to be done on the international stage, huge progress has been made. As of 2014, 86 percent of children around the world were immunized against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The WHO estimates that immunization of these along with measles saves two to three million people every year.Despite this progress, almost 19 million infants worldwide are not given basic vaccines. The reasons for this are many: limited resources, poor health systems, or competing priorities. But the results are tragic. Each year, there are an estimated 16 million cases and 195,000 deaths from whooping cough around the globe. Progress achieved by vaccinating against infectious diseases is encouraging. We can't afford a backslide caused by dangerous distortions peddled by the anti-vaccination movement.Many critics thus far have rightly taken aim at Latin American countries that are encouraging women to avoid pregnancy while Zika rages, but denying or limiting their access to birth control or abortion. Imagine this tragedy compounded by thousands of cases of preventable diseases brought on by unfounded fears of vaccination.We may think the great danger in this crisis is Zika. But global health organizations like the CDC and WHO need to be mindful of more insidious threats in their midst. It is one thing to fight a virus. It is another to fight misinformation.","huffingtonpost","left","16860","zika",829
"Brazil has reportedly decided to use the radioactive sterilization of mosquitoes as a means of fighting the Zika virus, with the blessing of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is shipping the necessary irradiator device.Dr. Kostas Bourtzis, a molecular biologist working with the IAEA, told Reuters that ""a Brazilian non-profit organisation called Moscamed will breed up to 12 million male mosquitoes a week and then sterilize them with the cobalt-60 irradiator, produced by Canadian company MDS Nordion.""The plan is to release these sterilized males into targeted mosquito breeding areas, resulting in a large number of dud eggs that will cut sharply into the population of the next mosquito generation. The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that spread Zika have a lifespan measured in weeks, so constant frenzied breeding is necessary to sustain their population. Females drop up to 200 eggs at a time, so each sterilized male should be able to sabotage a large number of eggs.Brazil is scrambling to get Zika under control before the Summer Olympics in August, which is a very short timetable for the sterilization strategy. Dr. Bourtzis said the program will begin with test runs in a dozen towns in northeastern Brazil, then ramp up for deployment around major cities, if the government chooses to provide the funding.The effectiveness of radioactive sterilization for controlling the Zika mosquitoes remains to be seen, although Popular Science reports the Portuguese have used the technique to control fruit flies on the island of Madeira, as well as ""other agricultural insect pests like screw worms and moths.""Popular Science describes the first stage of Brazil's sterilization plan as producing about 12 million sterile male mosquitoes per week.A similar strategy involving genetically-modified ""self-limiting"" mosquitoes which produce fatally compromised offspring was tested in Brazil last month, in what the UK Telegraph described as a successful trial that reduced wild mosquito larvae by 82 percent, but there is no mention of pursuing this technique in this week's reports about Brazil exploring radioactive sterilization.A rash of stories in late January suggested that genetically modified mosquitoes might have caused the Zika outbreak, but Discover denounced this as a ""ridiculous rumor"" and ""random nonsense,"" based largely on the unfounded musings of a single Reddit poster.","breitbart","right","16855","zika",372
" CHICAGO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - At Roberto Santos General Hospital in Salvador, Brazil, Dr. Antonio Almeida and a team of specialists are closely following two groups of women: Those who deliver babies with abnormally small heads and those who deliver apparently normal babies.The hospital is one of three in this city on Brazil's eastern coast where investigators are studying the most urgent question of the Zika outbreak: Is the virus causing a spike in birth defects, and, if so, how great is the risk?The answer will help shape the response to the rapid spread of Zika throughout the Americas. Concerns over the potential link to microcephaly have prompted a U.S. alert advising pregnant women against travel to 31 countries and territories with outbreaks.Officials in El Salvador, Colombia, Ecuador and Jamaica have urged women to delay pregnancies. The many unknowns about Zika's effects and transmission have cast a shadow over plans for the Olympic Games in Rio, set to begin in early August.The evidence so far is compelling enough that the World Health Organization declared an international health emergency Feb. 1. But it is mostly circumstantial: Suspected cases of microcephaly - a rare birth defect characterized by small head size and an underdeveloped brain - spiked 30-fold in late 2015, months after Zika's arrival in Brazil.There is harder evidence as well. Brazilian researchers have isolated the virus in brain tissue and amniotic fluid of 17 babies and stillborn fetuses with microcephaly whose mothers had symptoms of Zika infection during pregnancy.The finding provides scientific plausibility that Zika could cause microcephaly, a condition that can result in developmental delays as well as seizures, hearing loss, vision problems and trouble swallowing. They can range from mild to severe.""We know the virus can cross the placenta,"" said Dr. Albert Ko, a tropical disease specialist at Yale University and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a government research institute in Salvador. ""It can infect the baby, and it's likely the reason why these fetuses were stillborn or had congenital malformations. That is what we know up to this point.""The study in the Salvador hospitals is one of several aimed at proving or debunking the suspicion that Zika causes microcephaly.In the northeastern city of Recife, Dr. Ernesto Marques, a researcher from the University of Pittsburgh and Fiocruz Pernambuco, the state arm of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, is finalizing plans for a similar study in 12 hospitals.Separately, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planning a retrospective study looking at microcephaly cases already reported and comparing them to healthy births.The virus was discovered in 1947 in Uganda's Zika Forest. For decades, Zika had been associated only with mild symptoms, making it less of a concern than similar mosquito-transmitted viruses, such as dengue and yellow fever.Brazil is investigating more than 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly reported since October and, so far, has confirmed more than 400. That is a significant increase from about 150 cases in a typical year.Experts believe it will take six to nine months to begin to understand whether Zika can cause microcephaly. But it may take longer to reach scientific consensus.To establish proof that a microbe causes a disease, researchers often follow Koch's postulates, a method developed in the 19th century and used to show the HIV virus was responsible for AIDS in 1984, three years after the first cases emerged in the U.S.The method requires researchers to establish that the suspected pathogen is strongly associated with disease and that it can be passed from one infected host to an uninfected host and cause disease. The pathogen also must be isolated and grown outside the host, a step that Marques said had been accomplished with Zika.The epidemiological studies are case-controlled - following and comparing pregnancies that result in healthy babies to those that result in cases of microcephaly. They are looking for evidence that the Zika virus is passed from infected mothers onto fetuses who develop microcephaly.The study in Salvador hospitals is funded by Brazil's Ministry of Health and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. It aims to rule out Zika as a suspect in cases where other causes of microcephaly - including genetic disorders, cytomegalovirus and rubella infections, or exposure to drugs or alcohol during pregnancy - are found.In apparently normal babies, Ko and his colleagues will look for problems other than microcephaly that could be related to fetal Zika infection, such as vision and hearing impairment, intellectual disability, bone and growth problems, and liver and spleen damage. Such problems can also occur with exposure to other viruses, such as rubella, that cause microcephaly.""One possibility is that those microcephaly babies are just the severest cases and that they are only a small proportion of all the babies who were infected,"" Ko said.Along with full clinical and imaging tests, Ko's team is testing babies and mothers for active Zikainfections or antibodies.Pregnant women are asked about any fever, rash, itching or red eyes to determine possible exposure, said Almeida, hospital director at Roberto Santos General. They receive fetal ultrasounds to look for signs of microcephaly, such as brain calcifications.The study now includes more than 80 babies with microcephaly, and hundreds of normal births. Within the microcephaly group, some of the babies have unusual lesions in the eyes and ears. Preliminary results could be shared with the scientific community within the next month, Almeida said.In a recent case, Zika virus was found in the brain, bone marrow and spinal fluid of a stillborn baby who had severe brain lesions, he said. Head measurements suggest the baby also had microcephaly. The mother had no Zika symptoms during pregnancy, suggesting that the virus may cause microcephaly even in asymptomatic women.""We see the patients, and we are very, very scared,"" Almeida said. ""You can't imagine the suffering of the pregnant women in Brazil.""In Recife, Marques is gearing up a similar study that aims to enroll 200 babies with microcephaly and 400 healthy babies by June or July in 12 hospitals. Marques hopes to have some answers by August.No one wants answers more than Dr. Manoel Sarno, a fetal medicine specialist on Ko's team. In July, Sarno began to notice a spike in microcephaly cases among patients who recalled havingZika symptoms. Since then, he has identified 80 cases of microcephaly and has wept with many of the mothers.""I know all the world has a lot of questions,"" he said. ""We do also.""

"In recent years, the Nicaraguan government has sporadically mounted campaigns to control Aedes aegypti, the mosquito which transmits dengue fever, chikungunya virus, and now the Zika virus. Through a megaphone on top of a vehicle, the lilting guitar of the Nicaraguan folk classic ""Mora Limpia"" often announces the arrival of government workers with sprayers slung over their shoulders. As workers go house to house, the inhabitants empty into the street. A fog of the insecticide cypermethrin pours out of doorways and windows like sublimating dry ice, followed by the lingering smell of the diesel mixed with the chemical. The insecticide is highly toxic to fish, bees, and other insects in addition to mosquitoes. But this collateral damage is rarely mentioned in public discussion of the spraying. In Nicaragua and many other Latin American and Caribbean countries besieged by Aedes aegypti, eliminating mosquitoes by any means necessary is the modus operandi.   After Nicaragua confirmed its first cases of Zika in January, government workers fumigated 2.5 million houses in this country of six million. In addition, thousands of areas of standing water in yards, markets, and ditches -- perfect mosquito breeding spots -- were treated with larvicide. Some question whether such a campaign works, given that not all neighborhoods are regularly fumigated and some people won't allow the sprayers into their homes. There are only two alternatives, however: doing nothing or eliminating the mosquitoes' breeding places. The former would be both a public health disaster and politically unpalatable. Eliminating mosquito breeding spots would also present political and economic obstacles, but if these challenges were tackled, many problems associated with urban inequality in Latin America could be addressed, too.  Aedes aegypti is a creature of cities. It rests in and around houses, where it bites people during the day. To breed, it depends largely on water storage containers and rainwater that collects in garbage, tires, puddles, and drainage ditches. Even a bottle cap dropped in the street provides enough water for Aedes aegypti larvae to develop. The female mosquito also generally feeds on human blood to produce eggs, so the higher the human population density, the more successful it can be. Latin America and the Caribbean is the second-most urbanized region in the world and the planet's most unequal. 80 percent of its people live in cities. While these cities have grown explosively over the past sixty years, so has economic inequality. Pervasive poverty and lack of housing have caused informal settlements to blossom in the margins of the region's metropolises, and urban infrastructure hasn't expanded sufficiently to serve them. Many Latin American cities are fringed with neighborhoods that lack paved roads and reliable, piped water. Some communities also lack municipal garbage pickup. When water is only occasionally available, residents are forced to store it, typically in open containers. Likewise, without municipal garbage pickup, people accumulate trash in their yards or deposit it in nearby ditches and informal dumps. These behaviors create ideal breeding grounds for Aedes aegypti, as do the puddled, dirt roads and poor drainage frequently marking the region's low-income communities. For these reasons, the rapid growth of unequal cities in Latin America has paralleled the resurgence of Aedes aegypti there. Expansion of international and domestic travel, mosquito resistance to DDT, and deteriorating political support for eradication programs have also contributed to the mosquito's spread. Now, Zika has brought needed, renewed attention to the mosquito problem of Latin American cities long plagued by dengue fever. But it remains to be seen whether this attention will provoke more than sporadic spraying campaigns. Like dengue fever and chikungunya, Zika needs to be properly framed as a disease worsened by expanding cities and urban inequality. Over time, the unplanned growth of cities magnifies mosquito-borne threats, and the living conditions of urban poverty magnify them even more. While fumigation and vaccine research are important steps toward ameliorating Zika's impacts, so is providing reliable water and sanitation services to all urban communities. Roughly 12.5 million city-dwellers in Latin America and the Caribbean lack an improved water source. Many more lack a consistent improved source. Eliminating the need to store water in open containers would be a significant step toward preventing the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. This would require a substantial, sustained commitment from local governments, international development organizations, and neighboring countries such as the US that have an interest in controlling Zika. But such a commitment would not only inhibit the transmission of diseases. It would also improve the quality of life for millions and more fully integrate their communities into urban life.In Nicaragua's capital, Managua, most of the 150-plus informal settlements lack water service. Many neighborhoods that have water lines only receive water intermittently. As a result, thousands of households store water in barrels, buckets, and washbasins. After the fumigators leave, these containers are covered with a film of insecticide. For a while, mosquitoes will be scarce. But until all of the people in this metropolis are considered part of the polis -- the body of citizens -- the buzz of mosquitoes will return. To finally end the scourge of Aedes aegypti requires ending Latin America's epidemic of inequality.","huffingtonpost","left","16864","zika",874
"Scientists have confirmed that the Zika virus, which has infected upwards of one million people in Latin America, can severely damage the brains of unborn children. Now a new study suggests the virus may also trigger brain infections in adults that can cause the brain and spinal cord to swell, causing intense damage to the nervous system.A study published in the medical journal The Lancet argues that new research indicates a link between the contracting of the Zika virus and an infection known as myelitis, which causes inflammation in the spinal cord. Targeting such a central part of the nervous system often leads to patients experiencing difficulty moving and paralysis.While the news that Zika can cause other related infections is not new, the link between the virus and infections that can cause severe neurological problems has yet to be conclusively proven. This study, based on a case in Guadeloupe island in the Caribbean, is the first to stake such a claim. It notes that a patient on the island, a 15-year-old girl, was diagnosed with myelitis and later found to be carrying high amounts of Zika virus in her blood.Dr. Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization has called the study ""the strongest evidence so far that this may be a causal relationship,"" and has called for more research on this front. While it is being called ""the first published case to offer proof of a link"" between Zika and neurological disorders, it is not conclusive, and scientists hope to expand on the study by researching the effects of Zika on other patients.Other cases linking Zika and paralysis may offer more evidence that the virus specifically targets the human nervous system. The Agence-France Presse cites a case of an octogenarian Zika patient in France, who had contracted the virus while traveling on a tropical cruise. The man was ultimately diagnosed with a similar inflammatory infection: meningoencephalitis, which causes the brain to swell. Doctors found no evidence that any other health complications separate from the Zika infection had caused the inflammation. It is also the first such case, however, leading doctors to call for more research on this front.In most patients - a full 80 percent - contracting the Zika virus does not trigger any symptoms, and most carry the virus without knowing it. In the majority of the 20 percent who do experience symptoms, it causes milder variants of symptoms typical of dengue fever: rashes, fever, joint pain, and conjunctivitis.The outbreak of Zika virus in Latin America has caused panic because doctors in Brazil discovered a causal connection between Zika living in the bloodstream of pregnant women and unborn children developing severe neurological disorders. The number of cases of microcephaly, a condition in which children develop a skull too small to hold their brains, has skyrocketed in Brazil, where 1.5 million people have been confirmed to carry the virus.In addition to microcephaly fears, there is growing evidence that Zika may cause Guillain-Barré syndrome, a condition causing intense joint pain, paralysis, and death. At least eleven Zika patients have died following a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré in Venezuela, where hospitals and pharmacies are facing severe shortages of medication. Guillain-Barré is typically treated with injections of either immunoglobulin or albumin, neither of them commercially available in most Venezuelan pharmacies.The growing body of study suggesting Zika may trigger more significant nervous system damage may also shed light on the death of Bruno Rodrigues de Almeida, a Brazilian law professor who died after being diagnosed with Zika. Doctors announced that his death was the product of Zika ""complications,"" but never elaborated on what occurred following his infection.Zika is spread through mosquito bites from the Aedes aegypti species, common throughout the Western Hemisphere. Recently, scientists have found that the virus can also be sexually transmitted. ""Reports and investigations in several countries strongly suggest that sexual transmission of the virus is more common than previously assumed,"" WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said this week.The United States has registered dozens of cases of Zika, though more are expected as the winter months end and the weather turns more favorable for mosquito reproduction. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control have expressed particular concern for Puerto Rico, which has already seen a rise in the number of cases of Zika. ""Puerto Rico is on the front lines of the battle against Zika and it is an uphill battle,"" CDC director Tom Frieden told reporters this week, adding that he was ""very concerned"" that the number of Zika cases in the island territory could reach ""hundreds of thousands.""","breitbart","right","16871","zika",767
"The Zika virus, which is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is strongly suspected to be linked to a new wave of microcephaly cases in Brazil. Babies born with the birth defect have smaller heads and sometimes brains that aren't fully developed, which can result in life-long developmental problems.   Zika is currently spreading through Central and South America and the Caribbean, and with the high volume of news about the virus, it's tough to stay up-to-date. Check out our full coverage, or read our daily recaps.Here are four updates, opinions and developments to know about now:  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating 14 new reports of possible sexual transmission of Zika virus, some of which involve pregnant women. Two cases have been confirmed to be Zika virus, and preliminary laboratory evidence suggests that four others may be, but confirmation is pending. For the remaining eight patients, testing to detect and confirm Zika virus is ongoing. For all of the cases in which information was available, the partner who had traveled to a Zika-affected area was a man. Each one reported Zika virus symptoms within two weeks of their female partners' symptoms, suggesting the men transmitted the virus to their partners. The CDC notes there is currently no evidence women can transmit Zika virus to their partners, but more studies are needed. Because sexual transmission of Zika virus appears to be a lot easier than originally thought, the CDC emphasized that travelers who have been to a an area with Zika virus transmission should protect their partners -- especially a pregnant partner. These guidelines include practicing abstinence or using condoms during vaginal, oral or anal sex. Pregnant couples should also discuss travel histories and potential exposure to Zika virus with their OB/GYN.  Brazil plans to breed and then sterilize male mosquitoes by zapping them with gamma rays from an irradiator, a technique that in the past has been used to control fruit flies, reports Reuters. These newly sterilized male mosquitoes will then be released into the wild, where they will mate with female mosquitoes and produce sterile eggs that won't result in offspring. Experts described it as a ""birth control method"" for mosquitoes and hope it can curb the Aedes aegypti population -- the insect that's the main transmission mode for Zika virus.  In early February, President Barack Obama said he'd request $1.8 billion in emergency funding to respond to the Zika virus. On Monday, he made his request official -- and bumped up the ask to $1.9 billion. In response, several GOP lawmakers are now suggesting that the White House draw from the unspent $2.7 billion approved for Ebola, reports Reuters.While the White House isn't necessarily opposed to this suggestion -- indeed, they're also seeking permission to use a portion of the Ebola money for Zika virus -- they say that the scope of the Zika virus outbreak necessitates new funding and they want to leave a ""significant portion"" of the Ebola budget to help West African countries recover from the epidemic.Health officials have said that the money requested for Zika will fund research for a vaccine and a diagnostic test, aid to other countries hit by the outbreak, as well as provide help to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, which is at high risk of having a large Zika virus epidemic. Global health experts from the CDC to the World Health Organization to Bill Gates' Gates Foundation have all expressed interest in the promise of using genetically modified mosquitoes to control mosquito populations and mosquito-borne diseases. But conspiracy theories linking the emerging technology to the actual spread of Zika virus abound on the Internet, and FactCheck.org decided to take these stories head on in an authoritative debunking story. No, the Gates Foundation is not behind the Zika virus epidemic in Brazil. No, genetically modified mosquitoes were not released in the same areas experiencing the highest Zika virus and microcephaly rates. Unfortunately, one recent poll shows that more than one-third of Americans believe some version of this conspiracy theory. Gates, whose foundation funds global health initiatives, spoke favorably about the worldwide response to Zika virus, pointing out that scientists and governments are working together a lot faster than when the Ebola virus broke out in West Africa in 2014, according to Reuters.Gates also said his foundation has invested in research focusing on how to make sure mosquitoes are incapable of carrying disease and eradicating the mosquito population entirely. ","huffingtonpost","left","16854","zika",768
"Paulo Nazareth: Sem titulo, da série Objetos para tampar o Sol de seus olhos (Untitled, from the series Objects to Keep the Sun out of Your Eyes), 2010; photo printing on cotton paperA New York perspective on Brazil's enduringly vibrant art sceneI'VE SPENT THE past week viewing as many of New York's fourteen art fairs as possible. For me, the Armory Art Fair has always happily marked the start of the spring season and the yearly cycle of international art fairs. Attending is a little like going to a gigantic wedding reception -- speaking with hundreds of ""family"" members over an intensive six-day period. It takes days to walk the Fair's aisles, during which you encounter superb displays of art, catch up with friends and colleagues, collectors and dealers. And this year there were not only the Armory's two piers but the added energy of the Volta Art Fair on an adjacent pier -- let alone the really big thrill of the Independent Art Fair, which was stationed in Tribeca on three upper floors of a new building that featured soaring ceilings that afforded light and space to more than forty well-selected gallery presentations. And that's to say nothing of the deliciously sophisticated ADAA art fair on Park Avenue and the anarchic energy of SPRING/BREAK's 800 artists inside the McKim, Mead & White-designed James A. Farley Post Office Building.As someone who maintains a home base in São Paulo, everywhere I was asked for my perspective on South America's current outlook and the Latin American art scene. Literally hundreds of people asked me ""Who's hot on the Brazilian art scene today?"" ""Who's buying the new and now?"" ""When's good for an art tour of Brazil- before or after the Olympics?"" ""How's the country dealing with the Zika virus?"" ""What's up with President Dilma and the 'detention for questioning' of former president Lula?"" ""How about that pessimistic 'sky is falling' vision of the Brazilian art scene in full-fledged crisis that was recently sketched in Artsy?""My instant response was that I'm so looking forward to one of my favorite art fairs in the world, São Paulo's SP-Arte art fair, which runs April 7-10.But there's really no simple response to these questions that gives an accurate impression of the Brazilian art scene that I have come to know and admire over the past decade. It's a scene that's taken decades to grow, a complex cultural ecology, resulting in a vibrant Brazilian artistic landscape that's actively engaging international audiences. In my view, the growth of this scene and its underlying cultural currents are far from slacking. It's a scene in which both seasoned cultural institutions and brand new ones are taking wing and finding new ways to support new programming and visionary projects.Without a doubt, Brazil's macroeconomic conditions are in the midst of a perfect storm: rising unemployment; rising inflation; rising interest rates; governmental corruption; and trade imbalances due to a radical drop in revenues as prices plummet on raw materials (from cattle to oil and iron ore) as these materials are being sold in diminishing quantities to the nation's No. 1 customer China (which is facing its own downturn). But as I've been having conversations about Brazil with dozens of art-world players, I've come to realize that it's far too easy and too glib to collapse the nation's macro conditions into a general fret about the Brazilian art scene; a close look at the granular, microcosmic conditions prevailing at galleries and museums, and with individual artists, gives a different feeling.It Takes a VillageIt takes generations to organically grow a robust art market with a full range of cultural support systems. For a big picture vision of the Brazilian art market, I spoke with SP-Arte art fair founding director Fernanda Feitosa. She told me that at last month's Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation (CIFO) conference Dutch-based art market expert Dr Olav Velthuis said, ""The boom that the contemporary art market in Brazil witnessed over the last decade is only the latest stage in a much longer process of art world emergence. This emergence has been a slow and tedious process, as it almost invariably is (Europe and the United States are no exception in that respect). It is the result of the persistence, passion, and painstaking efforts of many people, some professional, other amateur, some rich, others poor, some local, others foreign, some acting on their own, others concertedly.""Feitosa also said that during her 2004 research period before launching the SP-Arte art fair in 2005, she discovered that ""no international galleries would come to Brazil. Global galleries said Brazilian audiences didn't have a global vision. And then in 2005 when SP-Arte launched, it had one international gallery -- Sur, from Uruguay. And this year there will be 39 international galleries."" As to the assertion that Brazilian galleries are only now being forced to actively reach international audiences, Feitosa went on to point out that ""it's part of a natural growth process to go global, it is not a sign of weakness. Luisa Strina has been developing an international market for her artists for more than thirty years.""Many have expressed fears about statistics they have seen about falling gallery sales in Brazil. But when you analyze and contextualize the facts, you see that most statistics do not break out national versus international sales, nor do they depict the national sales in a telling, granular way. For example, the Artsy article cites a sales drop for Galeria Millan, but when I spoke with Galeria Millan partner Socorro Lima, I discovered that the article neglected to mention the bravura, new São Paulo gallery space that Galeria Millan opened three months ago in Vila Madalena, which is even bigger than their primary space. The new space opened with a solo show by master painter Paulo Pasta that sold 110 percent -- meaning that the show sold out, along with Pasta works already in the galley's inventory. Lima said that while national sales are down, international sales are up. Nor does the article touch on the confidence I heard from other gallerists who are expanding their galleries: Nara Roesler Gallery opened a Rio de Janeiro space last year and Fortes Vilaça is scheduled to open an exhibition space in Rio de Janeiro in September 2016.Fernanda Feitosa reminded me that ""growing an art audience takes time. When SP-Arte began in 2005 it had 6,000 visitors. In each subsequent year the audience has grown. The 2015 edition brought 23,000 attendees, a quadrupling of the viewing audience. And all the while we've been building our VIP programming, so that we cultivate leading art collectors from both Brazilian and the international scene. Of course, audience cultivation requires many other elements, including arts reporting. Since our fair began, four art magazines have launched: ARTE!Brasileiros, Select, ZUM, and Dasartes.""And competition helps to build audience. Five years ago, the ArtRio art fair launched with great fanfare and began developing its own unique draw of international galleries and Brazilian galleries wishing to reach Rio de Janeiro's unique audience. And with ArtRio's opening a governmental concession dropped federal and state taxes for purchases made during the run of the art fair, which permitted Brazilian collectors access to standard, international art prices. That move by ArtRio provoked SP-Arte competitively to introduce the same feature at their art fair -- so that during the past decade these two art fairs have done more than increase the visibility of Brazil's growing art market: they have created unprecedented breaks in onerous trade barriers.Below, installation view of Galeria Millan's new gallery space, with a painting by Paulo Pasta For a big picture view of Brazil's cultural institutions and their present standing, one of the leading museums in Brazil is the Pinacoteca do São Paulo. The museum's Director of Institutional Relations, Paulo Romani Vicelli, wrote to me saying that ""the crisis is real, but it´s not melting our solid institutions. Last year Pinacoteca celebrated its 110th anniversary, showing its vitality and openness to new ideas. Our newly created patrons group purchased the first performance art work for the collection -- Mauricio Ianês' O Nome/The Name). Moreover, 2015 delivered record attendance for us, with over 570,000 visitors.""The growth of art audiences is something that Fortes Vilaça Gallery partner Alessandra d'Aloia focused on, during our conversation. ""A diverse Brazilian art scene has spent decades building international audiences. Brazilian collectors today are much more aware about their role in building the art market. And in the past couple of years museums are making such a big effort to make active committees and grow their patron groups. Patronage takes time to build. And it's a new generation that is beginning to engage being patrons. This is about being conscious about being a citizen in your country. And this big effort being made is bringing change to institutions.""D'Aloia went on to point out that there is a growing group consciousness on the part of Brazilian gallerists. Eight years ago eight galleries formed ABACT, a collective action group that today has grown to fifty member galleries who invite collectors, critics and curators to come to Brazil to learn about the art scene first-hand.One of Brazil's most remarkable contributions to global culture is Inhotim, the art park created by private collector Bernardo Paz that has dozens of dedicated art-filled buildings and installations on a glorious jungle site that is three times larger than New York's Central Park. I've frequently described it as one of the Eight Great Wonders of the contemporary art world, it was begun more than twenty years ago. It started attracting a trickle of private visitors that has become a powerful stream. First opened to public visitors back in 2006, in August 2015 Inhotim reached the two-million-visitor mark.And what's it like to lead a cultural institution in Brazil today? I spoke with Heitor Martins, president of the board of trustees of MASP/Museum of Art of São Paulo and the former president of the São Paulo Bienal Foundation.""First, let's acknowledge the economic crisis: the country is under real strain,"" said Martins. ""And the crisis effects everything, including the art scene. But Brazilian arts institutions have never been stronger. Let's look at the culture leaders. In 2009 we revitalized the support of the Bienal, and it continues ro be very stable and healthy, promising a great edition for September. Pinactoca is working strongly and is in good shape. MAC-São Paulo has a new building and just opened, so that the whole collection can finally be seen; a triumph of government support. MASP has in the last twelve months -- in the midst of the crisis! -- revised its board, begun renovating its building, and eliminated debt. And in Rio de Janeiro, MAR, a magnificent new museum has opened. Major institutions are so much better than ten years ago. Previously, our cultural institutions worked on a European model where the state pays for everything. This is changing. There is a market shift. Private people are reaching into their pockets and declaring their love for art and public institutions. Things are working despite the economic environment, and this is great.""Below, Adriana Varejão: Kindred Spirits (2015); oil on canvas in three partsUnfortunately, many recent dire assessments of Brazil's art scene have remained only on the surface. They declined to take the reader on a more informed journey. The really interesting story here is that Brazilian galleries have been living behind onerous tariff barriers set by the federal and state governments. Art is classified as luxury good, just as a Gucci handbag is, and as such is taxed a very high import surcharge. The result is that it is far cheaper for Brazilian collectors to buy Brazilian artists exclusively, as those artists are much cheaper than international artists of the same stature. So the Brazilian government has created an insulated internal market. What this means is that when the economy weakens, as is now happening, nationwide collectors cut back on their art purchasing and the galleries have to reach abroad for collectors -- which is what we are seeing now. Smartly, rather than sitting still, the most well-heeled galleries are opening international offices and galleries and/or increasing their participation in international art fairs.Thus the much bigger story that lies untouched -- much more serious than a superficial claim that ""the sky is falling falling"" (because markets always pulse up and down and back) -- is the need for an examination of Brazil's protectionist economic trade policies.  As many have noted, it is these policies that create false economic markets and spread corruption into every aspect of Brazilian life. That is the really alarming story, and one that The Economist addressed a couple of years ago when it placed Brazil among the lowest of 185 countries ranked for transparency in business transactions.Three years ago on behalf of Huffington Post, I had the great pleasure of interviewing André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, the curator of a visionary photographic exhibition of Modernist Brazilian architecture that was at São Paulo's Instituto Tomie Ohtake. A renowned economist and Brazil's United Nations-based environmentalist (who was appointed Brazil's ambassador to Japan, during the closing days of the exhibition), Corrêa do Lago shared with me his optimism about Brazil and its future.""Demographically, we are a young country. Unlike Europe and Japan, Brazil has a demographically young population. And it is increasingly educated. Amazingly in just a generation, Brazil has wiped out poverty: Brazil's statistical status with the UN used to be that it was graded with one-third of its population living in poverty. Thanks to Lula and due to governmental development, that is no longer the case. Families are encouraged to keep children in school. We now have an educated working class and a growing and striving middle class. We have the trained people to address our nation's problems. We have the tools and the people to create a bright future. The question is: Will we use this to our advantage?""Corrêa do Lago is one of many accomplished individuals who have shared with me their profound passion for passing culture, education and inspiration to the next generation. I have never forgotten my conversation with him in the halls of the Instituto Tomie Ohtake. His words crystallized something profound. It was a ""coming together"" of aspiration and vision and possibility. That is Brazil's secret sauce -- its power and strength: the striving and inventive nature of an increasingly vivacious and educated people, to grow, improve, and advance.The demand for Brazilian artists on the international stage is not falling. There is more and more interest in top-ranked artists who have international presence. Yes, Brazil faces a profound economic crisis. But irrespective of macroeconomic fluctuations, contemporary Brazilian artists are giving powerful voice to the unique experience of living in today's multi-cultural, global community. As such, the international art world is making its vote of confidence by purchasing Brazilian art and showcasing Brazilian artists. Says Galeria Millan partner Socorro Lima, ""Brazilian art has entered a powerful new place, because it's now recognized as having a powerful international voice. No longer the ""exotic."" Only recently has Brazil achieved an equal footing on the global scene. The world is more open and Brazilian art is in a strong place. There are now so many bridges between Brazilian art centers and the world.Perhaps Mendes Wood DM partner Matthew Wood said it most eloquently, ""It's too easy to be focused on troubles.... I am interested in artists. And I look for believers.... I kind of love the artists who are lunatics, that are mad believers.... There is criticism of our culture here in our artists, but not cynicism. That is important to me. Faith. Believers.""I can't help but admire the extraordinary artistic talent, growing diversity, and international cultural vision to be found in Brazil today. This is a vibrant time in which artists and other culture-makers are inventively finding new ways to grow, even under complex economic conditions. CIFO conference attendee Dr. Olav Velthuis may have said it most clearly: ""Well before Brazil's economic boom, entrepreneurial gallerists such as Luisa Strina, Thomas Cohn, and Marcantonio Vilaça managed to make a market for contemporary Brazilian art. They did so in times of dictatorship, political corruption, and economic hardship. The present economic downturn will not be able to destroy what has been built up over the course of a century.""Sometimes we all get so caught up in the prices of art and the regular gyrations of the art market that we loose sight of the value of art. Every day and under varied economic conditions, artists are working away creating their personal visions that give us unique insight about our lives and our culture. Long after we are all gone, art is what will remain as the vessel of our civilization. Life is brief, art is long.Below: Maurício Ianês: Deletrear lição #1: ideologia (Spelling lesson #1: ideology), 2013; variable dimensions installation with sixflags made of polyester and viscose fabric, metal eyelets","huffingtonpost","left","16874","zika",2884
"Olympic officials are forging ahead with the Summer Games in the country where the ominous Zika outbreak began, betting the Brazilian winter and months of prep work will triumph over disease-carrying insects and critics who say the event could scatter the virus across the globe.U.S. women's soccer goalkeeper Hope Solo is on track to compete in Rio de Janeiro despite initial wariness. Golfers Vijay Singh of Fiji and Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland and others are dropping out, saying they won't take their chances with a mosquito-borne illness that causes birth defects and has been linked to debilitating syndromes.Thousands of people will flock to the games in August, sparking fears that visitors will become infected in the South American hot zone and carry Zika back to their corners of the globe.More than 150 health experts called on officials last month to postpone or move the games. They argue the virus is still rampant in Brazil, where doctors in 2015 spotted a first-of-its-kind link between the virus and an uptick in babies born with abnormally small heads.For its part, the International Olympic Committee is relying on guidance from the World Health Organization to defend the games.Both the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the Olympics will amount to a tiny blip in potential transmission of Zika, though they advise pregnant women to stay away if they can.""Travel to the Olympics accounts for less than one-quarter of 1 percent of all travel to Zika-affected areas,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden told Congress last week. ""So even if the Olympics didn't exist, 99.75 percent-plus of the risk of spread would continue.""As a result, experts say it makes more sense to defend against infection than scrap the highly anticipated event, which was awarded to Rio in 2009.Team USA will house athletes and staff in air-conditioned quarters and distribute OFF! bugspray and long sleeves and pants as part of the delegation's casual wear so they can avoid mosquito bites. It also will hand out condoms since the disease can be sexually transmitted for at least six months.U.S. men's indoor volleyball coach John Speraw told The New York Times that he plans to freeze his sperm ahead of the Games, because the 44-year-old coach and his wife don't want to wait for any infection to dissipate before they try to have another kid.Others are not going to Rio at all. Earlier this month American cyclist Tejay van Garderen withdrew from consideration for Team USA because his wife is expecting their second child.Australian golfer Marc Leishman pulled out in May, citing his wife's recovering health after a near-fatal illness.""Last April my children and I almost lost my wife Audrey to Toxic Shock Syndrome. Since then Audrey has been prone to infection and is far removed from 100 percent recovery of her immune system,"" Mr. Leishman said in a statement released by PGA Australia.Among nonathletes, NBC ""Today"" show host Savannah Guthrie recently announced she is pregnant and will not travel to Rio.To protect those who do travel, the IOC has said venues will be inspected daily for puddles of stagnant water where mosquitoes can breed.""Our partners in Rio continue to work on minimizing the risk of visitors coming into contact with the mosquitos that spread the virus,"" the committee said in a statement to The Washington Times.""It is also important to note that the Rio 2016 Games will take place during the winter months of August and September, when the drier, cooler climate significantly reduces the presence of mosquitos and therefore the risk of infection,"" it said.Others aren't so sure.Zika is new to Brazil, so no one knows if transmission will dip far enough to make a serious dent in the mosquito population, said Amir Attaran, a population health professor at the University of Ottawa.""Sports fans who are wealthy enough to visit Rio's Games choose Zika's risks for themselves,"" Mr. Attaran wrote in recent commentary for the Harvard Public Health Review, ""but when some of them return home infected, their fellow citizens bear the risk too - meaning that the upside is for the elite, but the downside is for the masses."" ","washingtontimes","right","16974","zika",716
"150 public health experts are calling on the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Olympic Commission (IOC) to postpone or relocate the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in response to the outbreak of Zika virus in that city that has infected thousands and caused thousands of cases of birth defects in infants.The letter, published on social media Friday, was authored by four prominent public health academics and signed by dozens of others who note that Olympic Games have been postponed, even canceled entirely, over security concerns, and that the risk of triggering a global spread of the aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries Zika, is not worth the perceived benefits of holding the Games at their scheduled time.""The 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympic Games were not just postponed, but cancelled, and other sporting events were moved because of disease, as Major League Baseball did for Zika, and the Africa Cup of Nations did for Ebola,"" the authors write. ""An unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic.""The authors call it ""unethical to run the risk"" of spreading Zika through the thousands of tourists expected to visit Rio de Janeiro for the Olympics, particularly given that Rio is a hotspot for Zika, even in Brazil, the nation most affected by the current outbreak. ""Brazil's government reports Rio de Janeiro state has the second-highest number of probable Zika cases in the country (32,000) and the fourth-highest incidence rate (195 per 100,000), demonstrating active transmission,"" the authors note.The Washington Post notes that the signatories to the letter include representatives from over a dozen countries around the world. Those from nations not affected by Zika fear the introduction of the virus into these new climates. The authors add that the rates of dengue fever in Brazil, also transmitted through the aedes aegypti mosquito, have been growing, as well.The letter not only requests that the Olympics be postponed but challenges the World Health Organization to prove that it has no vested interest in the Games going on as scheduled, regardless of whether they post an international health risk. The authors accused the WHO of having a ""troubling"" response to calls to reschedule the Games and request transparency in the group proving it does not have a ""conflict of interest."" The letter is addressed to Dr. Margaret Chan, the head of the WHO.Two of the authors of the letter, NYU's Art Caplan and the University of Ottawa's Amir Attaran, have been calling for the Olympics to be postponed for months, until the full extent of how much research would be required to fully understand the threat of Zika became clear. ""Are you really going to try to run the Olympics this August in the middle of a public health emergency when the country can't afford to finish the buildings, and has got to take on the mosquitos?"" Caplan asked in February, suggesting that taking one's family into Rio de Janeiro during the Zika epidemic would be like saying ""Let's visit Chernobyl to enjoy the Olympics!""Speaking to Breitbart News Daily's Stephen K. Bannon in February, Caplan suggested taking ""six months, get nine months, postpone this Develop a good diagnostic test. Get something that lets us test the blood supply. Make sure that we've killed all the mosquitoes. You know - let's use some common sense here.""Attaran recently published an article in the Harvard Public Health Review calling for the Olympics to occur later in the year or in another location. His has been the most scathing criticism of the WHO to date, calling the organization's action in response to the Zika outbreak ""deplorable, incompetent, and dangerous.""""Mass migration into the heart of an outbreak is a public health no-brainer,"" Attaran warned.The Zika virus typically produces no symptoms in an estimated 80 percent of the people in infects. In the 20 percent that experience symptoms, these tend to be mild fevers, aches, and conjunctivitis. The real threat of Zika, experts content, is to the unborn child.Children born to women who have been bitten by Zika carriers during their pregnancy are significantly more likely to develop neurological birth defects. In Brazil, the most common defect has been microcephaly, a condition in which an infant's skull is smaller than its brain, crushing the brain and causing severe developmental problems. Many of the thousands of children with Zika-linked microcephaly in Brazil have died early, and scientists are unsure how much special care those who survive will need in their lifetimes.A study released in May found that the strain of Zika in Latin America is new and significantly more dangerous than the known strains in Africa and the south Pacific.The IOC has repeatedly asserted it will not postpone or move the Olympics, however. ""The IOC absolutely is not complacent. We do take this very seriously. Everything is being done to contain and reduce this problem in the lead-up to the games,"" Dr. Richard Budgett, medical director of IOC, said in February. In April, the IOC issued a statement confirming the Games will go on: ""The Brazilian people will deliver a memorable Olympic Games full of passion for sport for which they are world renowned The Olympic Games will deliver an important legacy and provide an important opportunity to unite the people of Brazil no matter their background or political views.""","breitbart","right","16948","zika",906
"The World Health Organization on Tuesday urged countries affected by the Zika virus to think outside the box and consider the use of sterilized mosquitoes, larvae-eating fish or other techniques to wipe out pesky insects that are ferrying the disease across Latin America.Citing Zika's suspected link to birth defects, the global health agency said it is looking into the pros and cons of novel strategies to wipe out the Aedes aegypti mosquito, including the mass release of genetically modified males that disrupt mating patterns.""Given the magnitude of the Zika crisis, WHO encourages affected countries and their partners to boost the use of both old and new approaches to mosquito control as the most immediate line of defense,"" WHO said in a statement posted on its website.The Zika virus is transmitting in at least 30 countries, mostly in Latin America, and has been linked to an uptick in babies born with abnormally small heads - a condition known as microcephaly. Scientists are also researching a possible link to Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can lead to paralysis.The mosquito that carries Zika is particularly nettlesome. It hides in homes and bites during the day, and it prefers human blood, which contains proteins the female uses to develop her eggs.Health officials in Brazil and elsewhere are still pleading with citizens to knock out areas of standing water where mosquitoes can breed, calling to the most effective way to cut the insects' ranks.                                                                    SEE ALSO: CDC chief: Link between Zika, birth defect 'increasingly certain'                                            But it is also recommending new field trials to determine if genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are an effective tool.A British company, Oxitec, last month reported that its genetically modified male aegypti, which mate with wild females to produce offspring that do not survive for long, were able to reduce wild mosquito larvae by 82 percent during trials in Piracicaba, Brazil, in 2015.The company acknowledges that there could be unforeseen consequences of its method, ""as with any new technology."" But Oxitec insists that its upside far outweighs any potential risks, and that it is targeting aegypti mosquitoes that are invasive to Latin America, anyway.""To me, there are no drawbacks. These GMO mosquitoes are sterile males and do not persist,"" said Amesh A. Adalja, senior associate at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Health Security. ""If human life is the standard of value used, GMO mosquitoes are a crucial tool.""The WHO is also studying a technique in which male mosquitoes are sterilized with low doses of radiation and then released. A female mosquito that attempts to mate will be unable to lay eggs and will not seek a new partner, due to chemical signals transmitted to it by her first partner.""She's done for life,"" said Zach Adelman, an associate professor of entomology at Virginia Tech.Scientists also could release mosquitoes that carry Wolbachia bacteria into the infected population. The bacteria has been shown to disrupt mating cycles and slow the transmission of a related virus, dengue, in Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and Vietnam.Other countries are opting for biological solutions. For instance, the WHO says El Salvador is using larvae-eating fish to eliminate newborn mosquitoes from water storage tanks.Among better-known techniques, the WHO says spraying the adult mosquito population isn't ideal, as it can lead to insecticide resistance in some populations. Plus, the Aedes aegypti mosquito that's plaguing Brazil and other hard-hit nations tends to set up inside buildings, so spraying is impractical.Though Zika is not transmitting on the continental U.S., it is spreading in Puerto Rico and has come back with travelers who visit Latin America. It could become a homegrown problem, however, as summer approaches and temperatures climb.The good news is that Aedes aegypti populations tend to be limited to a few Southern states, such as Florida and Texas, and many American homes and businesses employ air conditioning or have screened-in windows, forcing the mosquitoes outside.However, a second species - the Aedes albopictus - is a known vector of Zika and more prevalent in the U.S. ","washingtontimes","right","16847","zika",682

The tests will be able to determine if a patient has the virus within hours. Currently, doctors send samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Results can take weeks to return. Even utilizing local and state public health laboratories takes longer time than hospital-based testing, said Dr. James M. Musser, chair of the Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine at Houston Methodist Hospital, one of the two teams to develop the test.Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) unveiled plans this month to screen for Zika through local labs to reduce the wait period in high risk groups, mainly pregnant woman who traveled to a Zika infested region. However, said Musser: ""Hospital-based testing that is state-of-the-art enables our physicians and patients to get very rapid diagnostic answers. If tests need to be repeated or if our treating doctors need to talk with our pathologists, we have the resources near patient care settings.""The Zika direct test can be performed on blood, amniotic fluid, urine or spinal fluid, according to Dr. James Versalovic, pathologist-in-chief at Texas Children's Hospital and leader of the Texas Children's Zika test development team.""With travel-associated cases of the Zika virus becoming more prevalent in the United States, coupled with the looming increase in mosquito exposure during spring and summer months, we must be prepared for a surge of Zika testing demand,"" Versalovic said. ""We must provide answers for anxious moms-to-be and families who may experience signs and symptoms or may simply have travel history to endemic areas.""The test works by detecting genetic material of the virus, and can distinguish Zika from other viral infections like Dengue or West Nile, Musser also commented.For now, the test only will be offered to patients at Texas Children's or Houston Methodist exposed to Zika and exhibit symptoms of the virus such as rash, arthralgias or fever, and to asymptomatic pregnant women who traveled to any of the affected countries. The hospitals said their labs will consider referral testing from other hospitals and clinics.The CDC reported 82 Americans contracted the virus through travel as of Feb. 17. They also announced Tuesday 14 more people may have contracted the virus in stateside via sexual contact. The nation's first sexually transmitted case of Zika happened in Dallas, the same city where the first case of the deadly Ebola virus entered the United States in 2014 through an infected Liberian man.The L.E. and Virginia Simmons Collaborative in Virus Detection and Surveillance sponsored this joint effort to facilitate the rapid development of a test for virus detection in a large metropolitan area, according to the press release. The collaborative formed after the Ebola virus scare.Presently, there is no vaccine for Zika virus, only preventative measures. Dallas officials said Monday they intend to begin annual mosquito abatement a month early, on Mar. 1. They will be rolling out a simultaneous Zika public service campaign that stresses the steps people can take to minimize mosquito bites, including wearing repellents containing DEET, even though no local mosquitoes have carried Zika virus. ""Everybody always wants to ask, what can the county do, what can the federal government do, really it's what can the citizens do?"" said Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director.Brazil and the University of Texas teamed up to develop a Zika vaccine they hope will be ready for clinical trials within a year and market-ready in three years. For now, the World Health Organization (WHO) continues to advise pregnant women to consult their doctors before traveling to Zika affected countries and even delaying travel. They declared Zika virus and its suspected link to birth defects, a ""global health emergency.""

"The World Health Organization on Monday cautioned against instituting travel or trade bans in response to the Zika virus, even as it declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency.""The committee found no public health justification for restrictions on travel or trade to prevent the spread of Zika virus,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said in a press conference after a Monday meeting of the organization's emergency committee to discuss the virus. Scientists believe that Zika is causing an outbreak of microcephaly, or malformations of the head and brain, in the children of women infected while pregnant. The WHO's Monday declaration that the recent outbreak in Central and South America is a public health emergency is only the fourth time the organization has used that designation. It is the body's highest alert level.The virus is spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitos, and Chan stressed that there are ""simple, effective measures we should be taking"" to prevent mosquito bites, especially for pregnant women in the afflicted areas.Dr. David Heymann, the WHO assistant director-general and chair of the Zika emergency committee, said during the press conference that there was a ""very clear recommendation from the committee"" that travel and trade bans are not necessary at this point in time. In a follow-up statement, the group said its standard recommendations ""regarding disinsection of aircraft and airports should be implemented."" This practice of spraying an aircraft for insects is meant as a preventative measure to stop the spread of potentially infected mosquitoes to other countriesThe WHO most recently gave its public health emergency designation to the Ebola outbreak of 2014 and 2015, which killed over 11,300 people. The organization also cautioned against travel and trade bans during that crisis, warning that bans could not only devastate the economies of the affected countries, but could also hamper the world's ability to track and contain the outbreak. ""In the face of so much uncertainty around this, clearly one wants to exhibit an abundance of caution with respect to the advice that you're giving -- especially to women, especially women that potentially could become pregnant or women that are pregnant,"" said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the WHO executive director for outbreaks and health emergencies, at a press briefing on Jan. 28. ""But at the same time you want to make sure you are not putting in inappropriate measures or advice."" This is a developing story.

"The research group Fiocruz announced it will investigate a recent miscarriage that occurred after the mother contracted Zika. It could be the first miscarriage in Rio de Janeiro caused by the virus.The woman ""had a normal pregnancy,"" but she contracted Zika in her sixth month. The doctor scheduled delivery for the following week, but she ""underwent surgery to remove the fetus"" on Tuesday. The baby passed away ten days ago.An autopsy will reveal if the virus killed the baby.Doctors performed an ultrasound on December 25 at 33 weeks. They did not find any abnormalities in the skull and thought the baby was well.American doctors discovered the Zika virus in the placentas of two women who contracted the virus. They suffered miscarriages after they returned to the states.STAT reported three women suffered miscarriages; the CDC confirmed Zika in two of their placentas. Researchers said the miscarriages occurred in the early stages of the pregnancy, but did not provide further details.Other doctors have discovered Zika in the tissue of infants who died from microcephaly, a rare birth defect that occurs when the brain does not form properly during the pregnancy or after birth. It results in a small head for the child.""This is the strongest evidence to date that Zika is the cause of microcephaly,"" explained CDC Director Tom Frieden. ""Zika is new, and new diseases can be scary, particularly when they can affect the most vulnerable among us.""Frieden stopped short of claiming Zika caused the microcephaly. He said scientists need to perform more tests to confirm an actual link.The CDC stated the disorder is typically uncommon. Following the Zika outbreak, however, Brazil has documented more than 4,000 cases and is diagnosing an average of 200 cases a week. In 2015, the country tracked an excess of 2,400 cases, compared to 147 in 2014.Doctors reported 404 cases of microcephaly in newborns since November. They tied seventeen ""to the Zika virus."" Fifteen of the 404 passed away, ""with five linked to Zika."" Authorities are investigating 56 other deaths and 3,670 cases.Brazilian authorities also found Zika in three people who died last year.

"Living in Houston, Texas, mosquitoes are simply a part of our daily lives. Hot and humid one day, rainy and stagnant the next, Houston is a breeding paradise for mosquitoes. The Zika Virus is going to be a massive issue for everyone, but especially in states like Texas, where mosquitoes are able to breed all year round. How are our elected officials planning on preemptively addressing what we all know is going to happen?  The Zika virus is already here, and it will eventually be an emergent issue -- it's just a matter of time.As a nurse, my first and foremost priority is our patients. As nurses, we must advocate for our most vulnerable patients -- our pregnant mothers and their unborn babies.  Regardless of where you live, regardless of your profession, share this article and ask your representatives what they are planning to do to help protect women and babies. We have to collectively raise awareness while demanding preemptive action.Prevention Guidance:Until my next delivery <U+2665>Find your representatives here to tag them on Facebook or Twitter.","huffingtonpost","left","16832","zika",196
